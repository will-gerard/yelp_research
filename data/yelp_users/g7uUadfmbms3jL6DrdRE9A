The park is very nice and a great play area for toddlers. We went to a birthday there this weekend and it was generally very clean and well maintained. Looking forward to the Christmas time train ride but not looking forward to battling the crowds.

We had an amazing time ringing in 2014 at Ocean Club.  We made dinner reservations at 9 intending to hang out the rest of the night.  Table was ready right away, server was awesome and the food didn't disappoint!  We all ordered a surf-n-turf steak and lobster combo and shared the lobster mashed potatoes.  The warm butter cake is a MUST order! Yum!  Great way to ring in the new year and we are considering going back next year!

Great Salad bar and selection of ready to eat foods for a quick lunch break. Its almost overwhelming because of all the selections but everything is fresh and yummy. Of course things are overpriced but we all know that is typical of Whole foods. Whatever you're craving, they have it!

Always good food and service- the garlic dip is awesome and we always order it with cucumbers instead of pita. The nachos are awesome and they have the yummiest rice pudding.

This place is great for breakfast but you must arrive early, the wait can get to be too much and just not worth it especially on weekends. they are very kid friendly, our server was amazing (Andre) and he even brought our 1 year old a birthday crepe after we finished our meal, a true classy move! The only reason for the 4 stars is the wait of busy days. Other than that, its great! the veggie skillet is delicious.

Vitos is very good, they have a great happy hour in the bar and on the patio. Our food was excellent, we had the seafood gratin pasta and the brie apple appetizer. The first time we went and ordered the grilled calamari, it was too spicy to eat, had it been less spicy it would have been amazing. The kids meal was surprisingly good, a nice portion of mac and cheese and side of grapes, strawberries, and apples. I highly recommend this place

The actual 60 min was pleasant but my ears hurt so bad for days after! Its been 6 days and still my ears are throbbing. I almost went to the doctor because I felt like I had double ear infections. I would not do this again but the spa and staff were wonderful. It may just be that I have sensitive ears because I did wear the earplugs how I was instructed.

I went to Primp and Blow Biltmore yesterday for an eyelash fill.  It was my first time at this location.  Making the appt was super easy and they were extremely friendly.  Kai did my lashes and she did an amazing job!  She started my appt on time, and got me in and out of there in record time.  Lashes look great and I will definitely be going here for my fills from now on!

Wonderful patio for this time of year. The menu is slightly limited but that is typical at any foodie place. Our server was great, the brussels sprouts are incredible and they are one of the few places that serve sand dabs in the valley. Highly recommended.

BEST fish taco around. Hands down. My husband had the pasta with seafood and alfredo sauce, it was good but too heavy for me. I was shocked that 2 tacos filled me up SO much. I cant wait to go back. The seafood chowder was also a highlight. The kids mac and cheese was just KRAFT brand but our 1 year old liked it so we cant complain!

NEW OWNERS! Thank goodness, they took this spa to the next level with the decor and customer service. The results of my gel mani lasted over 3 weeks and my regular pedicure lasted almost a month. Karyn is the best- I would for sure ask for her to do your treatments. This is for sure my new go-to!

Great experience here! The oysters were so fresh and every employee was so kind and accommodating. I loved sitting at the oyster bar and watching the guys clean each oyster and pack it on ice. Dessert was delicious too, happy to recommend this place to anyone looking for fresh seafood in Arizona!

A very fun trip for the whole family. The movie portion is a little long if you have VERY young kids but the butterfly part is fantastic. ITs very hot and humid so be prepared for your hair to frizz and leave dripping wet. WE will probably save this activity for the winter time, not the AZ Summers.

We LOVE this neighborhood place- the owners are adorable and the food is very good. The calzone with added ricotta is by far my favorite and there is plenty to take home. Sit on the patio now that the weather is nice!!!

Super cute patio and awesome drinks. the only reason they dont get 5 stars is because they do not offer Italian Sodas which is what I like to order at coffee shops since I dont drink coffee. Highly recommend this place if you like coffee and tea!

great concept and fun place to take out of town guests. I like the sushi and chopped salad the best but everything we tried was good. the portions are not huge so taking my husband is not the best idea- he needed a cheeseburger on the way home. Perfect for a girls lunch or happy hour though!

This place is awesome. We visit almost daily and the employees are so nice and friendly in addition to making the best coffee around. The coconut latte and the macadamia nut breve are so delish. It's never too busy and since the new manager took over the service has improved tremendously.

Love this place. The classes are incredible, the teachers are awesome, and the environment is very motivating. I love leaving feeling like every ounce of energy has been sucked out of me- I literally feel like I've climbed a huge mountain by the time the class is done. Highly recommend The Madison for anyone that gets bored with cardio and wants to change things up. The class is intense- very non zen but you have to know that going in.

The location is so cute- they have a fantastic venue that was set up for a wedding and the food is excellent, especially the pretzels. The brunch menu is limited but everything on there looked good.

I find it hard to believe this has a 5 star rating- it must be the owners and their friends writing these because it is nothing like the reviews say. Our waiter didn't say 1 word to us other than "what I can I get you". I've honestly never had a more unfriendly server and it seemed like he was the owner. Clearly he was busy and had his hands full, he was the only one serving but he could have at least been even slightly friendly. Honestly, so turned off. The food was ok, nothing special, had to ask for a refill of water even though my glass sat empty for nearly 20 min. The desserts looked good in the case but the lack of customer service was such a turn off we will not be back.

The service was awful, only 1 person working and he seemed to be the owner. Very unfriendly, nobody greeted us. Would not go back at all. totally disappointing based on all the good reviews!
