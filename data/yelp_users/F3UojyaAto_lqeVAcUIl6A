For a sandwich shop with a limited selection they really bring their A game. I cant remember the name of my sandwich but it was a hot sandwich with schredded chicken and all of the extra goodies on top with a special sauce. It was quite delicious ....so if I were you and in the area of this shop I'd definately go check it out =) small but good =)

If you want good service and excellent food that is off the beaten path look no further!  I ventured to this little gem and found one of my new favorite places to eat Bosnian cuisine. We were greeted by a friendly waiter and quickly were offered any table to sit at. Finding the perfect table quickly and then sitting to examine the menu.   We were told that the "Bosnian Sausage" was the best thing to try for a newbie to the Bosnian taste. We quickly ordered one non spicy and one spicy sausage and it came on fresh bread and some sauces on the side.Writing this my mouth is watering again.   Anyway  delicious and we decided to get the "Turkish Coffee" at the end of our meal as well as a selection of dessert. Our waiter knowing this was our first time to the resturant wanted to make our experiance that much better and gave us the desserts on the house. All I can say for this place is if you want to venture out and try something new get down there and get some goodness.

Nice prices! If you need a cheap tool to get a quick job done this is your store. But if you need a wrench that you plan on handing down to your grandchildren I don't think this is the place for that kind of quality.Also if you plan of shopping here don't forget to use a coupon as well as in store deals of the week. Who knows you might need something on sale that week.

THIS IS THE BEST SPANISH RESTAURANT PERIOD!!! i have nothing but positive things to say about this place the dish's each time we go cooked to perfection and the atmosphere is great! the Paella(has shellfish shrimp and miscellaneous sea dwelling additives on Spanish rice) is by far my favorite and the mojitos are amazing as well.....if your ever near this place and wanna have a good meal ......look no further because you found it =)

HERE WE GO!!! So this place is pretty much amazing great food great staff and just an amazing experience for a fondue restaurant the only thing was it was a little pricey but it was my b day and my loving amazing and so talented and beautiful and successful wife took me to enjoy some foods of the Gods =) so we sat down and ordered the 4 course dinner for 2 and we started with a very bitter cheese fondue and i wasn't impressed thinking this was a bust i lowered my standards of the restaurant and was surprised by the main course it consisted of steak shrimp chicken and teryaki steak ...so good =) and last but not least our chocolate fondue was impressive as well fruit and cheese cake and browny bites for your dipping pleasure

OMG!!! My amazing wife has done it once again....she managed to find a hidden gem.....well i am a pretty big fan of Mediterranean food so she already had me there but this place was hands down my favorite place here in Vegas so far....service was good and the place was clean and the beef and lamb plate my wife and i had were more than satisfying .....i was stuffed but my crazy wife remembered they sold baklava .....omg it was warm and fresh and i about died due to the amazing flavors of the baklava....id highly recommend this if you dont want something to upscale and just want a meal that will meet all of your expectations!

So my wife and I went there on a date and found a thai restaurant where we didnt have to drive a half and hour from our lovely North Las Vegas abode.   We enjoyed the thai aspect of the restaurant but the sushi was a little less than par thats the only reason for the 4 in stead of the 5.  The atmosphere was good very quaint but food was very fairly priced for the portions and just had an overall good experience

This is one of my favorite medateranian food places in all of Las Vegas. It is family owned and operated, they are both amazing people and super friendly as well as super helpful for the company that you bring for the first time that doesn't know what they want. I always get the lamb and beef gyros and it never disappointing. If I was you I'd put it on my vegas bucket list.

My wife and I frequent here often and we really enjoy the all you can eat sushi for 23.99 per person and its really convenient because of its location ....right down the street from us =) well anyway I would recommend the dynamite and the Washington salmon and of course their garlic tuna ....in my opinion their garlic tuna nigeri(sp?) is to die for =)

Well....where can I start.....my lovely wife and I  went here for some more amazing sushi when our knees were cut out from beneath us as we walked in .......*sigh*  We were presented with NEW lunch menus that were very disappointing....so my wife and I being addicted to ahi poke salads decided that we would just pay dinner prices so we could just get 1 each which is the restaurant policy but we already knew about it.  So no big deal.....then they killed us by saying that even though you are paying for 2 all you can eat you can only get 1 ahi poke salad per table.........my wife and I knowing this to be false asked the sushi chef on duty and he also said that 1 ahi poke per table.  We outraged by such senseless nonsense left.....the waitress had one of the worst attitudes I've ever experienced ......my wife left them you've been yelped cards and the waitress threw them out the door at her......VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.......a very sad experience since we love sushi and they are close......

Love this place! I really HATE all of the run of the mill super markets. Well now you know that about me. The store is quaint and filled with all of the organic goodies that my heart desires. The staff is friendly and willing to help when you seek them first. The produce is fresh and looks good as well. They also have a pretty decent meat counter without making the store feel like a giant  super market. In short I love the store super nice,clean, and organised.

All i have to say is the food there is exceptional my wife and i always get the all you can eat sushi from sunday-thursday because not only is it all you can eat sushi and some kitchen items its all you can drink bud light and house saki but friday and saturday this offer for the beer and saki is not available. the sushi itself is very fresh and the staff are very friendly and get you your food quickly for kitchen items. And if you plan on going back be sure to get a stamp card for the all you can eat sushi.

I enjoy discount minus the sales pitch but again you are going to a tire shop. Anyway I ventured to this conveient location the other day looking for some new rims for the wifeys car.(I needed my tires balanced and rotated) They had a good selection and were willing to work with me(haggle). I ended up getting the rims I wanted and everything done for my wife's car for an affordable price.

What a diamond in the rough this place is. I went here on a Friday night for happy hour. The place was not what you would expect for this area of town but none the less it was fun. The music is mixed from country to rap and they just throw everything together. Another good aspect of this place is the free buffet if you order drink(s). The buffet was very good and I believe it was actually from Bobby Q's menu. I had the pulled pork sliders and chips and salsa. The plates are small but the lines for seconds were small most of the time. Also the drinks on happy hour if you get a well drink (i.e. cranberry vodka) they give double shots for free and the drink was only 5 bucks. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and next time I will reserve a table so that we can enjoy the music more.

Well my wife and I dealt with Erin Omally. She was very nice and got all of the houses we wanted to look at in a timely manner.  She was also very knowledgeable in all aspects of buying a home and the steps involved! Overall she was a great Realtor and we would defiantly buy another home with her help!

Looking for something on the strip that you'll be able to enjoy and the price wont set you back to much    well i just got one of the normal menu sandwiches and it was very good and for how packed it was in the restaurant itself our sandwiches came up surprisingly fast and the atmosphere wasnt so bad just kinda noisy but where on the strip isnt! overall a very good sandwich shop and if i was on the strip near there i would definitely keep it in mind for a quick bite to eat.

Oh man I had such high hopes for this place. Well lets just get into it. When wegot there we waited about 2 minutes before being acknowledged then after finally being greeted we were shown to a table that was 2 seats and very close to another table with people. So I asked if there was anyway to move us to another table in which I pointed too. Only to be told "oh umm if I sit you over there and a party of 3 or 4 come we will have to move you". Being so perplexed by this answer my wife and I sat and stared at each other for a moment.    Then still wanting to give the restaurant a chance we ordered. We got stuffed shrimp and a Bianca pizza. Well the stuffed shrimp was fine I wouldn't order it twice. The pizza was also very bland and just not what we expected. Feeling a little dissatisfied with the whole experience we just left after that.

I recently had an eye opening experience readying an article about all of the crap foods anymore so I've been buying more organic.While there selection is limited it still covers the essentials in organic produce and milk and such.  For all of the other stuff they have although its not organic its fresh and most of the customer service is friendly.

Here we go.....well my wife and i frequent this pts and we always have mixed feelings....sometimes they bend over backwards to make our pts outing one to remember but other times they simply dont care and just do there own thing and make us feel almost unwelcome. We only go during happy hour for the drink specials and we also try to make football games for the half priced pizzas and other goodies...so i give them 4 stars only because the times we went were really good and they did everything they could and lacking 1 star because im still bitter from the other experiences......

This place is great. My wife and I often frequent here and enjoy the intimate atmosphere. The food is better than what you would expect from a normal bar.   My wife and I have tried their potato cheese soup as well as their chicken wings and chicken tenders and all I can say is they are way above the average bar food.   The staff is friendly and best of all its right down the street OHHH and they have a bitchen 2-7pm happy hour.....pretty sweet!

I saw the stellar reviews and thought to myself wow can this get much better. Well Iguess I was wrong. I called on 2/18/2013 and scheduled an appointment for 2/19/2013 at 10:30. Standing by waiting today the time rolled by 10:30,10:45,10:55, and 11:00 so I figured I'd make a call and see what was up.   I was surprised to be greeted by a voice mail considering this was a well review business. I left a message thinking he might have been busy and would call me back .I am sitting waiting for news of if he is even thinking about coming and giving me a quote.So in my brief encounter i would have to say no thanks to any further business.   Oh well I guess there are other fish in the sea.

OK well here we go ......*sigh*......*clearing throat*.....I frequent this range as often as I can it is maintained and has range officials of the highest standard.The only downfall is the drive to the range itself we live semi close but even for us its WAY out of the way.  Also the price is 7 dollars per person and if you are a first time shooter at this range no matter your experience you have to watch a 5 minute video about the shooting range rules and regulations.  Now to the meat of my experiences like I said before I come here often and it is an amazing range from the helpful staff to the range environment it is complete for all of your shooting needs. There are multiple ranges one 50 yard one 200 and a pistol range that varies from 5 yards to 25 yards.  So they have a "firing time" of roughly 20 minutes of free shooting at your assigned table and 10 minutes off to reset all targets and to have a break. During the "cease fire" time you can not go to your firing table and touch anything due to the people down range and it is highly enforced.  I recommend if you plan on going to go either in the morning or during a weekday because if the weather is nice expect to wait for a shooting table for up to two hours.   They have a skeet range for all you skeet enthusiast. I have personally never been to that range but I have heard good things.

*drool*.....I can hardly write this review without becoming hungry. Anyway I frequent this place as often as I can. I always order my ramen with extra pork and sometimes an egg. This place is very crowded most of the time but its worth the wait. So if you are thinking you're hungry and want ramen get here quick sit through the wait time and then feast on, in my opinion, the best ramen in china town.

Lets start out by saying I'm on a diet....yes I am... I think....anyway looking for some "healthier" options I found this place by of course using yelp and was sold as soon as I saw the buffalo chicken wrap. The wrap was very good the sauce was not so spicy but they had some hot sauce to compensate for my fire loving side. Over all very clean place, friendly staff, and nice atmosphere! Will be back for sure!

This place for just a waffle shop is so quaint and and quiet you almost feel like there might be something wrong with the food lol but there wasn't. I had a waffle sandwich and well as surprising as that sounds it was very good. It had fresh avocado and bacon as well as ham and it was superb! Alright more about the place. Well,  it has a pretty decent sized menu filled with what ever waffle fantasy creation you could think of and the prices are under $10 but above 5$ for almost all plates or waffle creations! The restaurant has lots of seating as well if you felt like you need to bring your football team or large family for some waffle goodness =)

If you have a commercial drivers license prepare yourself for the longest wait of your life.Some tips to help you expedite your service. 1. Make sure you get a ticket from the main window 2. After you take your picture go get another number from the CDL window( its the cash register on the counter). 3 Bring all appropriate documents ( i.e. Birth certificate, social security card, current license, and or passport) 4. Hope for the best and bring a book.

I was scheduled for a V.A. assessment here and it was the worst "Dr." visit I have ever experienced.  I had Dr. David Rand for the appointment.   I don't think I had him but an associate of his and he was the most inpatient man I've ever met. I went in and greeted him like a normal person and he just offered me a seat. After I sat we started talking about my VA issues and he went over some medical problems. After that he wanted me to elaborate on some of them. He began asking very broad questions and wanted a specific answer.   Needless to say this is when I tried to answer his questions only to be met with hostility. He started to yell at me for my answers to his question, stunned I got a very stern tone in my voice and said you need to be a bit more professional I'm not here to be yelled at. He then needed a minute to compose himself before continuing the visit. All I can say is wow if you get him for a VA assessment please look elsewhere. He was unprofessional and just a toad to me.

I LOVE THIS PLACE! Well I went here tonight and service was amazing and the food was also just superb. I started tonight's experience by sampling 2 beers and deciding on the hefferveisen it was very good and I asked for an orange to complement the flavor.   Here we go into the meal, For starters we got mozzarella and tomato salad that I totally recommend it was only 3 dollars and it has an amazing balsamic dressing on it. YUM  Main course I ordered the Portobello pizza and the chicken pot stickers for my wife and I and they were both amazing the pizza is a must try and the pot stickers were good BUT im just not so much of a fan of them anyway so they must have been amazing for me to finish my plate of them.

I've had this company out 2 times with an A/C issue. The first technician was very helpful ,quick and professional. The second time we had them come out we had another person look at my A/C unit. He was condescending and not understanding of the issue that I have with my A/C. He told me my duct work was too large for my A/C unit to function properly and that the home warranty company wouldn't cover it. I have however contacted my home warranty company and they do cover duct work.   All in all i would not recommend this company due to the lack of consistant service. They seem as if they work for the home warranty company more than caring about their customers needs.

Very cute place! A bit on the pricey side for a more cafe setting but still a pretty nice place and  unique. We had a burger and it did not disappoint. I would go back if I was in the area and wanted to spend some green on a light bite.

What a spot! Super close to where I live and what more can I say but WOW. Well I guess I can say more so here we go. I went here with moderate expectations of service and food. Like I said I live so close it was hard not to give it a try. Upon arriving we were greeted very quickly and given our choice of seats.   After looking over the menu and inquiring with our friendly waiter we made our choices. We both go the lunch special pho. It came with a spring roll ,herbs, sprouts,and jalapeno on the side of the pho. The pho itself was very good my wife and I both were surprised with the mixed reviews of both the food and the service since we didn't experience any of the above.   Over all it was a very good experience and I will be back to indulge in some pho. But the one and only drawback to Pho 35 is it didnt offer desert. But with so many other little shops around the area it wasnt hard to fufill that order.

Well my wife and i go to sams alot for pet food and miscellaneous goodies we use alot ....the main thing to remember about sams is they sell in bulk.....BUT the samples and shopping experience is always a good one .....the downfall is you have to be a member which is about 50 bucks a month depending on what plan you get....but i really enjoy it for the bulk items

Great tacos! Great moonshine! Great time! If you're looking for a date night place or just somewhere new to try I'd give this place a shot. I went during happy hour (3-6pm) and it was a great time with good pricing! I will be going back!

If I could write a review for the technician it would be good (4 stars) we were given Roland for our tech he was nice professional and communicated everything with my wife and I.   As for the company they are a 1 star. I've had to have Rolland come out 3 different times to service my swamp cooler only because they don't stock parts in their work trucks. I saw the work order Rolland submitted to the company listing my house to be done A.S.A.P. I'm still waiting for them to get back out to rectify the issues im having with my swamp cooler. Its been about 7 business days and my swamp cooler is still not fully working.   Will not ever use this company again.
