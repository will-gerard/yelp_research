When I was shopping for an alarm and stereo system for our crossover, I happened to walk in this place and decided they would be earning my business.  I am very picky when it comes to installers for car alarms and car audio.  They do prominently show Rockford Fosgate, but carry brands like Morel.  They already understand I am not a neophyte when it comes to car audio and understand my pickiness quite well.  They are very knowledgeable when it comes to their products and will work with you.  Their installation shop was one of the cleanest I have been in.  I have seen some shops with stuff strewn all over the floor which does give a less than favorable impression.

Such a shame that a good bike shop will be closing its doors on June 15th.  They have consistently provided good service and a very friendly atmosphere to shop for bikes or accessories.

After A-1 Bike Center closed in June, I had to find a nearby bike shop to take my mountain bike for maintenance and repairs.  After reading the reviews on Yelp about ABC, I decided to pay them a visit.  The first thing that struck me was how friendly and customer-oriented they are.   We have spoken with Bill and his brother on more than one occasion regarding a future bike purchase for my wife.  They even let her come in to do a demo ride of the bike she wanted right at closing time.    However, the truest test came a short time ago.  I suffered a blowout on a bike ride with my wife.  I took my bike to ABC for repairs and was told that I had to get the rear wheel re-laced. When I picked up the bike, I was impressed with the quality of the spokes (Wheelsmith) and how true Bill rebuilt the wheel.  I also had to replace the tire (brake caliper cut a hole in it) and inner tube.    After the repairs, I did feel that something was not right with my bike and took it back.  They replaced the tube with one that had a longer valve stem (no cost) and saw that my seat was broken.  After this round of repairs, I went riding and was quite happy with everything.  As a result of this experience, I am bringing both bikes in for maintenance (Very reasonable prices) and planning to purchase my wife's bike through them.

Brought my 2008 Ford Edge for a windshield replacement (insurance claim).  They did an excellent job of replacing the windshield along with putting a comparable 80% ceramic tint on it.    Even after they spilled my air freshener on the dash and ruined it, they promised to make it right and stuck to their word. Stewart and the guys showed me good customer service and followup after the accident.  That is enough for me to stick with them  Now, I have a 2011 Edge and need to have it tinted.  You can guess who I am going to.

As soon as I walked into this place, I knew I was at home.  Having worked in a body shop, I was familiar with paints, etc.  However, their selection of products blew away my favorite auto body supply store in Chicago (Erkert Bros. in Blue Island).  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and give you very rapt attention when you are looking for something.

Bear in mind, this review is strictly based on my experiences with the guys in the Magnolia Home Theater.  Being a bit picky when it comes to home audio and video, I usually avoid Best Buys like the plague and will frequent specialty shops.  When I first visited the Magnolia Home Theater, I was less than impressed with the product selection. For instance, brands like Harmon Kardon, Bose, and Definitive Technology do absolutely nothing for me.  Fast forward to now.  I stumbled in there and happened to see a B&W Zeppelin (iPod Speaker by Bowers & Wilkins).  I scanned around even further and saw more B&W product.  As soon as I hit the listening room, I hit the holy grail!  The DM series speakers I wanted were on display.  On top of that, they had Yamaha RX-V and Aventage receivers.  However, the receiver I fell hardest for was the Denon AVR-X4000.  They paired this receiver with the B&Ws of my choosing and Bryce, the salesperson helping me, was amazed at the quality.  Also, I looked at the Samsung 4K TV.   I got a quote from them and the price for everything was reasonable including the Audioquest Cinnamon interconnect cables.  I did promise Bryce that when I am ready to pull the trigger, I am going to hunt for him.  Bryce  is very customer focused and very helpful.  The best part of all this was that I found the system I wanted in a place that was not too far from home and all in one location! That's enough to make me go back and buy the equipment.

I have been to three different car stereo/alarm shops looking at alarms and other "goodies" for the vehicle.  Of the three, this place has one thing that is very unique - Experience with Fords and the Sync/MFT (My Ford Touch) System.  Speaking with James, the installer, is definitely NOT a waste of time.  The guy knows his stuff so well that I am personally making sure he's the only one touching my car when it comes time to upgrade my audio.    I like the patience displayed while I am checking equipment out and answering questions.  Additionally, I also like the cleanliness of the install area.  I am definitely looking forward to having them install my "goodies".

Years ago, I was out of town when I got a panicked call from my wife stating that someone hit our 2008 Ford Edge. After meeting with the party who hit us, we got three estimates to repair the vehicle.  The best one out of the bunch was Earnhardt Body Shop.    Being a person who has some experience in this arena, I looked closely at the quality of their work on other vehicles and I was impressed.  I left my Edge with them for around 2 weeks.  During that time, they allowed me to take a look at the car while they worked on it and I was even more impressed with how they paid attention to the details.    When I picked it up, I saw no trace of the accident.  In fact, the Edge looked better than showroom. No globs of paint, overspray, or even uneven surfaces from where they worked on the car.    While customer service was stellar, I paid more attention to the quality of work and that spoke volumes to the point I am going back to them with my 2011 Edge for some spot repainting.

My wife and I went to Tom's one time and one time only.  We tried their hot link and rib tip platter.  The first thing we were both horrified over was the thickness of the rib tip.  Credit card thin was the best descriptor.  Rib tips from the places I remembered back in Chicago were much thicker than this and had waaaaaaaaaaaay more meat.    The hot links really looked and tasted more like spicy hot dogs instead of italian sausage.  The sauce definitely left a LOT to be desired.  The aftertaste had me grabbing my drink faster than a Porsche 911 Turbo on nitrous gets from 0-60.    After the first bite, my wife and I tossed the stuff in the garbage and vowed NEVER to come back to this place because they have absolutely no idea how to do Chicago style BBQ properly.

I went here with my Toastmasters club for the officers' meeting.  I was very impressed with the quality of service given to my group.  Waitstaff was highly attentive and made sure everyone was comfortable.  The calamari at this restaurant was among the best I have eaten in the Valley of the Sun.  The presentation of the entrees and quality of food was equivalent to some of the restaurants I have been to in Chicago.  My wife and I will be back, hopefully with the live Jazz playing.

My mother and niece from Chicago came down here and wanted to take my wife and I to this restaurant because she wanted us to experience the ambiance and service based on their restaurant in Chicago.  Unfortunately, that left a LOT to be desired here.  The first thing I tasted was the crab legs on the bar and was shocked to taste how rubbery and overcooked they were. While the meat kept coming and coming, so did my digested contents due to the horrendous aftertaste in our mouths.  I did see a dessert item I liked but refused to get it after eating this meal.  When my mother got the $131 bill for the four of us to eat, I got madder than a hornet.  She was even more upset because of the high price for subpar food.,

As I have mentioned in many reviews, customer service and product knowledge go a long way with my wife and me.  Unfortunately, this place tarnishes a pretty nice brand and does not live up to the Doubletree/Hilton minimum standards for customer service.   Strike one came when our server (Bryan) did not know the non-alcoholic drink selection. My wife asked about that because there is nothing written the menu listing those kinds of drinks.   Strike two came when she wanted to ask a question. Before she could ask, he actually turned away from her. We both looked at each other with a "WTF?!?" Expression on our faces.  Strike three was the icing on the proverbial cake. When we got our bill, we saw a charge of $1.00 for grilled onions. On top of that, our bill did not reflect what was ordered. Instead of saying "Blue Cheese & Bacon", it said "Angus Burger" with an additional charge for bacon. After relaying our concerns to him regarding the extra charges, he gets the manager. This is when the fireworks start.....  a) I have worked in the restaurant industry and been to four and five star restaurants in my life. But I NEVER met someone so condescending as Ms. Hansen. When my wife relayed her concerns about the drinks not appearing on the menu, she basically told my wife, "We can put what we want on our menus!"  b) When my wife relayed her concerns about what was on the ticket, Ms. Hansen gave the same answer as the server (We had to do it this way so the chefs wouldn't be confused). The BS flag was waving proudly at this point.  c) Very few things could make my wife snap but this manager's condescending tone accomplished the feat quickly. She kept pushing my wife to get her card to pay for the meal which exacerbated the situation. After a terse exchange, the manager decided not to charge us for the meal (first thing she did right).  Bear in mind, this is a place that my wife likes to eat lunch at while out and about. Because of the experience we had this evening, wifey is never coming back.

If you are looking for a hidden gastronomic gem, Olive and Ivy fits the bill. The Italian/Mediterranean/California influence shows in the decor. The booth we sat in possessed a warmth reminiscent of many upscale restaurants I have been to in Chicago.  Our server, Melinda, was one of the most attentive servers I have experienced. She even did something special for me (mint iced tea) that I will be permanently ordering each time.  The Bruschetta were all delightful with the strawberry being my fave. All flavors were light and enjoyable on the tongue.

A few years ago, my wife randomly chose Neighborhood Vision Center to get our eyes checked.  Since that time, I have been quite happy.  First, the customer service is unrivaled even by some of the doctors I have had in Chicago.  After the typical battery of exams, my favorite part begins...picking my new frames.  I never choose a frame without doing the "Gaby" test.  Gaby is the office manager and she's got a really good knack for finding those frames that work well with your facial features, complexion, etc.  She and I are usually on the same page when it comes to picking frames for my wife and myself.  For instance, my wife and I both have Silhouettes,  Michael Kors, Oga, Jaguar, Nike (Sunglasses), Theory (Sunglasses), and other high end frames.  They also have a very extensive selection of sunglasses by Bebe, Juicy Couture, Nike, and others.  Besides Gaby, all of the office staff is a delight to work with.  I periodically bring my glasses back for adjustment by Rachel and she does a very thorough job in adjusting them.

One of the things my wife and I are huge on is customer service.  Ever since we have been to this establishment, we have been treated like family.  The managers make us very comfortable and even have special dishes prepared for us when we come.  Waitstaff is always pleasant to work with and know us quite well.    The best thing I have eaten there was the Delmonico steak and the grilled flounder (not on the menu, but it should be).  But even if you don't get a custom dish, their regular fare does not disappoint.

I have had the pleasure of dining at Casanova Brothers on several occasions and find the customer service equals that of or even exceeds the level of many four and five star restaurants I have been to in either Chicago or Phoenix.  They don't treat you like a "regular" customer, but as one of the family.  As for the pizza, the crust has the right consistency and texture.  There is a hint of garlic but it really balances everything out.  My favorite is their white cheese pizza with spinach.  Huge slices and a very balanced flavor.  Those comments are not easy to come by from me as I am a pizza "snob" originally from Chicago.  I even told Tony that this is the BEST NY pizza I have ever eaten...PERIOD!    I have also had pasta and other dishes there and they have a very nice taste as well.  I am not afraid to recommend this place and even tell those I send to let Tony know I sent them.

Been a customer of this restaurant for the 8 years I have been in Arizona.  They have consistently provided me with very stellar customer service and excellent food.  One of the dishes I prefer eating is the steamed chicken and broccoli (no sauce) and find it quite tasty to the point that it is my "norm".    I also like ordering the Pu Pu Platter, combination fried rice, and egg drop soup.

A short time ago, I was looking for an ice cream shop that was not a chain and had hand packed ice cream. Fast forward to today. My wife and I tried Udder Delights for the first time and actually found their sorbets a huge hit.   The first one I tried was the pineapple-passionfruit sorbet. That had such a well-balanced taste and just the right amount of sweetness.  After my wife devoured that, I went back in and got strawberry ice cream and chocolate sorbet. Of the two, wifey lost it when she tasted the chocolate sorbet. As the clerk said, it tasted like a very rich dark chocolate.  The strawberry was good but didn't have enough fruit for our liking.   My wife went in and tried the Mango (she didn't like that) but bought another scoop of pineapple-passionfruit sorbet to replace the scoop of mine she devoured.  I tasted the cinnamon ice cream and it's on my short list of flavors to get on my next visit.   The customer service was as delightful as the sorbets.   Rest assured, we will be back!!!

This evening, my wife and I went to Beijing based on her experience ordering food from them for lunch this past Friday.  I tried the noodles she had for lunch and found them quite tasty.  Fast forward to this evening's experience.....  a) I have never went to a Chinese restaurant that wasn't Panda Express where I placed the order at the counter when I was eating in.  We had to order our food before we could sit down.  b) The egg rolls were tasty but the steamed broccoli and chicken I ate was quite cool in some spots.  When notified, they did warm it up.  However, the rice was also not warm.  I tried my wife's fried rice and it was better but seemed to be missing something.    c) The food was served in paper plates.  Want silverware?  You had to go to the counter for that.  Drinks were served in styrofoam cups.  c) I happened to turn my head and noticed that the green beans were being prepared upon a public table.  Can we say potential health code violation?  d) When we were leaving, we were reminded to take our own trash to the garbage can by the front door.  With that said, the chances of me returning to dine here are pretty much slim and none.

Growing up in Chicago, I learned that the best places are those hidden treasures. This is one such place. People can complain about things like price and quality. However, this place tops those parameters for me. The staff is very friendly and always eager to hear your feedback. We even got visited by one of the owners (Vera) when we told the chef that the food was superb.  Speaking of the food, I was beyond impressed with the quality of the pancakes.  My wife says I have a tendency to taste pancakes like a sommelier tastes wine (She is right about that). The quality was equivalent to places like Stax Cafe or the Original Pancake House in Chicago. These were the lightest pancakes I have ever eaten and really did not require any syrup. But they did bring the syrup and it was a nice, warm, maple syrup. Definitely very flavorful combined with the pancakes.  Even without syrup, the pancakes had the right amount of moisture and did not feel as heavy as many places typically are. The omelets we had were oven baked and possessed the same light and airy taste of the pancakes.  But the thing that really colors my experience here was the "regulars". Seeing the staff interact with them brought back memories of a similar place (A cop hangout) I went to with my father. This restaurant treated us like family and we will look forward to being counted among the "regulars".

At one time, I would have gone to Airpark to tint my car.  However, after a experience with previous ownership, I decided to take my car elsewhere.  The first thing that soured my relationship with Airpark was when I contacted them for a tint quote before I replaced my windshield due to a crack.  When I told them about the windshield, they went into high pressure sales mode about replacing my windshield through my insurance.  Point blank, I don't handle high pressure sales tactics well.  After that, I received several calls to replace my windshield from them with a very pressured tone.    However, when I first went there, the customer service was stellar and the product knowledge was great.  They are quite pricey as my windshield alone cost $200 with their best 75% tint.

This is the most professional and caring dentist I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  However, he does possess a key trait that many providers lack - patience.  His thoroughness may drive Type As up a tree but people like me appreciate the thoroughness in the interest of keeping my teeth in good condition. I took my normally squeamish wife to Alpha Dentistry and she loves the thoroughness and patience that Dr. Le displays.  Another thing I like is that he is open on Saturdays, unlike many providers in the Valley.  That makes things much easier on the patient so they don't have to leave early from work or take days off to deal with the dentist.  The environment is very relaxing and will definitely put your mind at ease.

I am a firm believer of "you get what you pay for."  I have been in this store twice and am impressed with their service and selection of sofas.  Sure, they may be more expensive but the sofas come with a lifetime warranty on workmanship and materials and are custom designed to your specifications.    The sofas themselves are very solidly built. Their cutaway illustrates how well built these sofas are right down to the frame.  They have a huge selection of leather colors for you to choose from to fit your decor and will deliver the sofa anywhere in the country.

When this place first opened, they tried their best to please the customer.  Every time I told them they missed something, they would go back over it and clean it properly.  The last time I took my car there, I was less than happy with the service I received.  Cleaning wheels thoroughly is a standard practice at any car wash or detail shop and being confrontational with a customer when confronted with the fact that the wheels were poorly cleaned does not sit well with me.  The other thing that does not sit well with me is the upselling of services I do not need.  I don't need you to replace my windshield, redo my tint, change my oil, or any maintenance service.  If I pay for a car wash, I expect just that and expect my wheels to be cleaned thoroughly!!!  Fast forward to last Thursday.  I went there because I needed to clean my car and it was the closest.  The first thing that set me off was the glass man trying to get me to replace my windshield by saying there was pitting on it.  He actually kept pressuring me to the point that I was one millimeter from letting him have it with both barrels.  I kept my composure and went inside to tend to the payment.  Lenora was a bright spot after nearly wanting to strangle the glass man.  She illustrated professionalism and customer service.  They did manage to get my car done fast but.........  When I got back home, I saw that my chrome wheels had a dull finish to them.  Upon closer inspection, one of the attendants dried my wheels with the same towel used to apply protectant.  The next morning, I went back and explained the issue (after taking pictures).  They agreed to rewash my car.  After the rewash, I checked my wheels and saw they were normal.  However, after an attendant got through, I saw the same protectant issue.  I immediately asked for the supervisor on duty.  This guy was the polar opposite of customer service.  When I relayed my concerns to him, he attributed it to the car not being dried off.  When he wiped, it still did not look right.   I went in and told Lenora about it and she got Mario, the manager on duty.  He went outside to look and verified my concerns.  Mario made sure that the wheels were cleaned thoroughly and told me to look him up when I am back.  I would have changed my review based on that, but thinking about the glass man is forcing me to keep it where it is.  My stance did not change.  Do not upsell me on windshields or oil changes.  Just wash my car and make sure my wheels/tires are done to my satisfaction!!!

The major thing I like about Blue Sky is how convenient it is.  I like the location because it is easy to get to from home or office.  It literally takes me less than 5 minutes to get to Blue Sky from my office and takes about the same amount of time to get from the lot to the airport.  The shuttles are very clean and comfortable and they do come every few minutes or so.  The drivers are courteous and professional.  They give you the locator cards to ensure you will have no problems finding your car when you get back.  They will help you out with your luggage or whatever you need carried to the airport.    With this parking nirvana, there are a couple of dark clouds.  One dark cloud was that I was passed by at the airport by one of the shuttle drivers.  From what I saw, he did not get out of the center lane and just glanced over to see if anyone was on the curb waiting (I was sitting on the bench at the time) and just kept going.  Another shuttle came within a few minutes of that one departing and got me but I was perplexed as to why the other driver kept going like that.  The other cloud is based on the Cloud 9 card which gives you free parking after 7 visits.  After June 1, airline employees could not accumulate punches on their cards when parking with their discount.  I did find that quite handy.

Been trying to get in this place for years but the line literally wraps around the buildings.  Finally got in and I now understand why the lines are so long.  The lemon gelato has just the right amount of tartness and a balanced texture that borders on the smoothness and flavors of European Ice Creams.  The strawberry has the right amount of sweetness and the same smooth, creamy texture.  I even saw other flavors I am interested in trying such as the salted caramel.  However, the customer service provided at Frost will definitely ensure that people like me will return.  If I say I am going to look for a specific person to help me with anything, that means his/her service was THAT good.

I went to this restaurant with my wife and a friend of mine.  The seating and service were very prompt.  Decor was excellent.  Coffee had a bit of a bite to it but was decent.  I had one of their pancake dishes and was impressed with the quality of the food.  They were light, fluffy, and had the right texture.  Their eggs were very fluffy, light, and tasty.  The server we had was very friendly and made us all feel at home.  Her product knowledge was better than some of the waitstaff at four-star restaurants I have been to in either Chicago or Phoenix.    Will I come back here?  Absolutely!

My first experience with Chutney's was a New Year's party with a friend of mine.  The food itself was very tasty and deligtful.  In fact, my wife an I returned on a first Friday to catch the live jazz.    However, let's get to the meat and potatoes of this review.  One of the things I enjoy eating is the naan bread.  Their naan is prepared in a tandoori oven which gives the bread an excellent consistency and flavor.  We have had different dishes each visit and they have been very consistent with presentation and taste.  A few months ago, I decided to bring my Toastmasters group in for their Chef's Table.  If you have not experienced this, you are missing a true treat.  This six course meal will leave you very satisfied and VERY full.  The Mullitgitawny soup was sublime with its delicate balance of flavors.  The show stopper was the garlic cauliflower.  To this date, I still run into Toastmasters who talk about how good this dish was.  The 65 chicken is also very tasty.  I have been relaying these raves back to Shilpa, the manager and she leaves with a smile on her face.  The main entrees of choice are very tasty and customers are given a choice of spicy or mild.  The desserts are pretty tasty as well.  Speaking of Shilpa, she is a delight to work with.  I worked very closely with her in setting this up.  She did everything promised and then some.  Any concerns I had were dealt with in a very professional and expedient manner.  But even if we don't do the chef's table often, we will still return because of the quality of the food and the excellent live jazz that leaves a good note with us.

Based on the multitude of reviews, I decided to give Rob and I Clean Carpets a shot. The first thing I liked was the placement of the corner guards to protect my furniture and walls. Second was his thorough explanations of his processes.   It definitely shows he knows what he is doing because he literally undid the lousy job that Stanley Steemer did. The high traffic area looks better than new. He literally extracted the dirt and excess soap used to clean my carpet previously.  When I looked at the buckets, I was floored to see 4 buckets full of dirty water and grime.  Words could not express how much more crud had been pulled up from the carpet.  My area rug looks better than new. He is more thorough than all the companies I used in the past combined. He even raked the carpet thoroughly to restore nap and speed drying.    He even cleaned the carpet in my car to better than new.  The driver's footwell was extremely dirty over the time I owned my car.  When he got to it, I saw all the dirt from various parking lots, etc. disappear into the catch bucket.  Again, the water was extremely dirty from whatever they used in the past.  When I saw the final results of the initial cleaning, I was floored with the grime and gunk that Rob got up versus the others. My wife was even more impressed.  This carpet cleaning was equal to Eco Fresh but not as expensive.    But the main thing is customer service. He calls to make sure he is going to the right location. He also wants to make sure you will call him back when the time comes.   Guaranteed I will do just that, Rob.

I forgot to mention in my previous review of I Clean Carpets that he also does cars.  I actually had him clean the carpets in my Ford Edge and they came out better than any detail shop could have done.  Even the driver's side carpet was made to look brand new.  Again, I will be having Rob do my car as soon as possible to get my carpets clean.

We went to the new location at Pecos and Lindsay.  The first thing that struck us was the cozy decor. The best way to describe it was farmhouse contemporary (Not a bad thing).  I ordered the Farm Boy omelet and my wife ordered the Veggie omelet. The quality reminded me of a good oven - baked omelet but it wasn't.  My wife enjoyed the Veggie. I tasted it and the green pepper taste was more pronounced. She did enjoy the sausage. Her take was that it reminded her of being back home in MS.  As for my dish, I enjoyed mine. However, the potatoes were a bit heavy on the salt.  Otherwise, they were good. The coffee actually had a very nice taste to it.   One thing I would suggest on the menu is an option to build your own omelet. That would give customers the ability to select what they want. I also noticed that they do not have a whole grain bread for the toast. My wife does not eat regular bread and had to go without a side. There should be substitutions for people who have dietary restrictions.  Holly was a very knowledgeable server. That goes a very long way with me. Everyone (including the owner, Brett) was very friendly. Holly was attentive but probably got busy because we had to flag down another server for a coffee refill . However, the server who refreshed my coffee was very friendly. Seeing teamwork like that actually shows they care about customer service.  I did deduct a star for the inability to accommodate my  wife's dietary restrictions. But, we will return since the food was very good.

Being a person from Chicago, I am familiar with the adage that the best food sometimes comes from those places off the beaten path.  ATL Wings Your Way falls under that umbrella.  My wife and I stopped in yesterday based on the recommendation from a friend of ours and we were far from disappointed.  The first thing I tried was the Broccoli Bites.  These fried nuggets of cheese and broccoli were quite tasty and had us wondering if we were given enough for the $2.99.  The next thing we tried was the catfish platter.  The catfish was tender and succulent.  The breading was perfectly seasoned and reminded me of a few places back home (e.g. Sharks).  This is not a place that is going to fake a cornmeal breading on the catfish like many of the places I have had down here.  However, this is not a place like Sharks or J&J that cuts the fish up into steaks and tails but they do give you a decent portion.   The third thing was the wings.  Like the catfish, they did not disappoint.  We had the Sweet & Tangy, Spicy, and two different garlic wings.  Many places who make garlic wings tend to sometimes make the garlic overpowering.  This place did not.  The quality of the meat was first rate on all flavors.   The only gripe I had was with the soda dispenser.  Both times that I got Fanta Orange and Strawberry, I tasted more carbonated water than syrup.  I did notify Patricia about that and they promised to take care of it.    All in All, I enjoyed my first visit to ATL Wings Your Way and will return.

My first visit to Pig & Pickle was an absolute culinary delight.  Being a person partially of Southern heritage, I know a little something about comfort food.  The appetizer I had was very satisfying and had many delicate flavors that worked well together.  My entrée was a symphony of flavors that played well together.  I liked the quality of the meat and the sides.  I also enjoyed the attentiveness of the server (I had that poor man running back to fill my glass of tea quite often).    However, the most memorable thing was the Elvis which was a peanut butter based desert.  I ordered mine without bananas (I detest them) and it went so well with a nice cup of coffee.    Rest assured, I will be back.

When you find a good Chinese food place, you hang onto it for dear life.  When you find two, it's bordering on miraculous.  One thing that many folks who visit Chen's for the first time is that they are New Yorkers which means the Chinese food is going to have a different flavor, style and consistency.    The multitude of times that my wife and I have been there, we have been pleased with both the food and the service.  We always order the Egg Drop Soup which actually has a nice flavor and is pretty balanced.  The PuPu Platter is also quite tasty.  My wife has to sometimes fight me for the shrimp because it's so good that I am liable to eat hers and mine.    The entrees that we have had never left a bad taste in our mouths at all.  Everything we have eaten has been on point, consistent in quality, served promptly, and definitely reasonably priced.    The venue itself is more pleasing and relaxing than the Waldo's it replaced.  Also, the staff (including the owner) are quite friendly to us and know my wife and me when we walk in.  We are permanent customers.

Where do I begin?  For starters, this cleaners is open on Sundays which is a RARE feat in the Valley.  Secondly, their hours are conducive for most people to drop off and pick up their orders.  As for the quality, they have done a splendid job with cleaning some of the more difficult items in my wardrobe such as my linen shirt and pants. I have had them turn stuff back to me same day with the same level of quality I have come to expect.    Rest assured, I have some more "challenges" for them to try.

First visit to Gecko Grill was quite pleasing to the tummy. I saw this place en route to another highly Yelp rated business (Two Wheel Jones).  My wife had the Chicken Sopes combination platter with rice and refried beans. She enjoyed the flavors of the Sopes and the refried beans. I had the Taco and Burrito combination with Carne Asada. The thing that struck me was that the Carne Asada was cut quite small but I could taste the flavors.    The other thing is how attentive the staff is. There was one waitress (Heidi) who went to each customer to ensure they were satisfied. For us, that spoke volumes. Our server, Halee, was also attentive and professional.  No doubt that we will return.

While Dr. Finley is a good doctor with an excellent and caring demeanor, the office policies and staff are another story.  The first thing that set me off was Dr. Rachel Gittler. After examining me, she actually prescribed a medication that was not effective for someone like me. Needless to say, I was hot under the collar because of her startling and possibly life-threatening incompetence.    Fast forward to a few months ago.  My wife needed an emergency refill on her medications. Long story short,  it took more than a week and six trips to CVS to finally get them because every time they told us the prescriptions were ordered, the pharmacy had no knowledge of the order. Add the unnecessary inconvenience of having to go back to the office for an appointment whenever meds are needed and you have an idea of the vicious circle my wife was in.  Additionally,  Erica was extremely rude to my wife and even provoked a verbal altercation.    As a witness to all of this and a former patient, I cannot ever recommend the practice.  But if Dr. Finley is at a different office, definitely get her.

Unfortunately, Yelp does not allow for zero star ratings.  If I could, this place would be at the top of the list.  I wanted to order a pizza and wings for the Super Bowl.  Since this is a place I have not been to in Chicago or Phoenix, I wanted to look at the menu on line.  However, that was not the case.  Each time I tried, I got "This page could not be displayed".  On top of that, the results were the same on all three browsers I have installed on the computer (Chrome, Firefox and IE).    However, the worst was calling the restaurant.  Just imagine you call a restaurant to place an order and you receive a voice mail message that "the mailbox is full and cannot receive new messages."  Being originally from the South Side of Chicago where this restaurant is from, I take personal affront to any restaurant being from my home city and providing subpar customer service.  Fix your website so your customers can see what you offer and get some kind of phone system that actually works!!

Normally, I don't give a business a second chance after reviews similar to what I left for Sanfratello's.  However, I decided to give them a second chance simply because they were closer than my normal Rosati's.  The first thing is that it is not an easy place to find because it is literally buried in the mall. You really need your GPS to find the place.  But it is in the same lot as the Albertson's but closer to Warner than Lindsay.  Once you get there, you notice how small the place is (looks more designed for a takeout instead of dining in like their parent store in Tinley Park, IL).  You do have outdoor seating but that's even small.  One thing I found interesting is how quick they had a pan pizza ready.  I am accustomed to waiting 45 minutes.  They had my pizza ready in 25-30 minutes.  When I got the pizza, I was kind of taken aback because the container looked kind of small.  In fact, it almost reminded me of a personal pan pizza in physical size.  I even thought it was going to be a square pizza because of the rectangular container.  After taking the first bite, I saw that Sanfratello's uses the patty sausage similar to Pizzeria Uno and Due back in Chicago. With some of the crumbled sausage I have had, you do taste the seasonings through the meat.  In this case, I did not.  It did not have the full-bodied flavor I am accustomed to when eating a Chicago pizza.    The second thing I noticed was the crust itself.  I have to admit I was skeptical that it would be cooked thoroughly because of the short time.  However, that concern was squelched.  However, I am also accustomed to a buttery crust.  This crust was not buttery and even the tops were burned in spots.    Third was the tomato sauce. The sauce, like the sausage, was missing critical seasonings that provide the usual flavor explosions I am accustomed to with Chicago pizza.  Additionally, I did detect a bit of sweetness with the sauce which is abnormal.  All in all, I would say it's not a bad pizza but this former Chicagoan says it needs a few things that will turn it into a serious Rosati's competitor.
