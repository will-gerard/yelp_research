Attitude from the hostess Olives in the salsa Drinks not refilled! Food took 30 minutes to come out on a slow night. Server neglected us the entire time We asked for the manager.. after waiting 10 minutes we decided to just pay and leave Another 10 minutes for our check to come back. Still, manager never showed up  I'll never go back again.

The breakfast is awesome. We eat breakfast here 4 days a week, At least.  WHY? Because we always eat our for breakfast and 5 & Diner is the only place that:  1. is very inexpensive 2. has a very fun atmosphere 3. has a large menu 4. has constantly great customer service 5. is fast! It only takes about 4 minutes from the time we order it, before it arrives to our table.  And the food is great!  A great breakfast joint with great food and great service. ANT

In the year or so since I wrote my first review for 5 & Diner, ownership has changed hands. The first thing the new owner did was get rid of the crew (some had been working there 12+ years) and replace them with a very... How should I say... WHITE crew. The previous crew were mostly indians and some Mexicans (the joint is located on the reservation after all). But I suppose it was too dark for the new owners liking.  The next thing the new owner changes was the menu.  Cheaper options and less flavorful foods. Now, if you want a water you have to ask, where they used to bring one out right when you sat down.  When we used to get our food in 5 minutes or less (sometimes in only 3 minutes after ordering it), now it takes 15-20 minutes, even if the place is half empty. We wanted it to work, and visited 4 times after the new owners took over, but alas..  We shall never go back.

Decent food but horrible owner. I ordered a Diet coke. "We don't serve diet coke, the owner doesn't believe in it"  Doesn't believe it in? Diet soda is not the fricking Easter Bunny Diet soda is not the Lock Ness Monster. Is is a GD soft drink!!  "Why not?" I ask. "The owner hates fake sugar and refuses to support it" Says the server  " What about all this fake sugar on the table for our coffee? Every table has a bowl of sweetener on the table?!?!!" says me.  "Oh, that is for the coffee. He says it would upset too many people if we took it away. But you can go next door, and buy a diet there, then bring it over here if you like"  WTF?!?! Sure I'll go over there, next door every time I want a refill  So this guy takes his stand with diet soda? Does he have any clue what is in regular soda?!?! Hell, diet or anything else, it is all bad for you. But I want a diet and the owner won't serve it  Way to take a stance on such an important issue genius..  Never again will I support this restaurant.. Lame

Meh.. The pizza is barely decent and all 3 times I have been here, part of the crust was burnt to the point were it could not be eaten. Twice with family (they picked the restaurant, once with my fiancee).  The first 2 times with family. The service was decent, until the owner of the place, not only ran out of the wine that my fiancee asked for (Resiling), but in a sad attempt to cover it up, tried to redirect her choice of wines by saying that the Reisling they serve would be much different from what she was used to; as if the owner knew anything about my fiancees experience in wine. After my fiancee declined the few wines the owner kept trying to push, the owner finally admitted that she was out of Reisling. All this over an insulting 3 minute period?  On to the pizza. Burnt Crust and uninspired changes to a centuries old tradition.  We visited this place after coming back from our 3rd trip to Italy (sicily, Rome & Naploli) and wow. Why reinvent the wheel?  Italy has a ton of pizzas, all with individual names. None of the regular Italian named pizzas match up with what they serve at Grazie. They changed everything. An Americana pizza for example has french fries on it. (Strange to us, but normal in Italy. Just an example though) Everywhere in Italy, no matter where you go, if you order an Americana, you will get fries on your pizza. Not so at Grazie. Oh, they have an Americana, but rather than fries, it is completely unrelated to the Italian standard. They made up their own pizzas and named them after typical pizzas found throughout Italy. Nothing matches up.  I ordered the cinque formaggi (in Italy it is the quattro formaggi) Terrible. The entire bottom was burnt, and the cheese was covered in a thin layer of grease. A hint that they use cheap cheese.  Insults, burnt crust and a flare for unoriginal pizzas with the wrong names? No thank you.. I honestly would prefer Papa Johns pizza over this atrocity.

When we first moved to Scottsdale, we took our dog; Mamma to several groomers. Most were decent, but expensive. A friend suggested Canine Preferred and we have never used another groomer since. The staff is super friendly and Mamma always gets treated like a rock star.  Being a rescue, she is a bit skittish, but the staff at Canine Preferred in Old Two Scottsdale make her feel like one of the family. She actually enjoys being there. My guess, is because the dogs are not kept in creates, but rather are all free to walk around in a shared community environment. They walk around in little packs and socialize with each other. Something Mamma loves!!  I cannot speak better about this facility A+ rating all the way around!

How this place is in business still is beyond me. When walking in, the decor is old and drab. The grout int he tile is disgusting. The hostess was unpleasant and lighting, too bright.  The menu. Lacking The food? Warm rather than hot, and drab. The salads too, were warm  We will never go back.

I work within walking distance and used to go to Yvonne's all the time. I was a regular until the new owners purchased the business. I gave it 3 tries and have not been back since, nor will I ever go again This is how my last breakfast at Yvonne's in Tempe went:  Waited 3-4 minutes to be greeted - I ordered coffee and breakfast Another 5 minutes for my coffee to arrive. At this time,  regular customer came in at the 10 minute mark and was instantly greeted, and given coffee. I was neglected from this point forward.  10 minutes later, the regular got her breakfast.. 10 minutes later she finished, and paid while I sat, with my coffee unfilled, waiting for my food to show up: -Rubbery ham -Overcooked  egg whites -Dry toast.  30 minutes to get my food and not be given any customer service what so ever.. I'd like to blame the training of the staff for this one, but it was one of the owners herself that was my server...  This place was far better when the previous owners were in control

Service was great. The $355 meal was horrible. My bone in ribeye was burnt (not charred as I requested).  My wife's filet mignon was tasteless. Both cuts of meal were cheap.  I have had better cuts from Costco. The Cesar dressing was closer to a creamy ranch.  The $15 cheesecake would fit in to my coffee cup, and leave plenty of room for coffee  I don't mind spending $300-400 on dinner, and I realize we are in Las Vegas, but come one guys? Take some pride in your work!! If Tom Colicchio would have tried our meal, people would have lost their jobs.  Very disappointing.

LIVING PARASITE IN OUR FOOD - Manager did not care! - PICS INCLUDED  I signed up to yelp just so I could write this single review about Donovan's chop house in Phoenix AZ.  My fiancée and I went out for a night of celebrating.  A $250 meal is not uncommon for us, but usually with that type of price tag comes a certain level of service. Not at Donovan's Chop house in Phoenix.  It started when my fiancée finished her oysters and noticed that something was in the oyster shell that she just ate from. "Is that moving?" she said? "yes, yes it is" I replied.  Not only was it moving, but it was alive.  Turns out that a 'pea crab' was living inside of the oyster that my fiancée just ate. We looked it up right then and there. According to google pea crabs are parasites that feed off of the oysters food supply. When I showed the server, she was stunned. She told me she would shot h chef. I asked her to show the manager too, and she said "No, the chef will know what to do", as if I wanted the thing steamed and served with a side of butter.  Our meal came, and when I asked about the pea crab, neither the expediter nor the bus boy, knew about our situation. It was only after I asked the server about what the chef said that the situation was acknowledged at all.  It was actually a full hour after finding the crab before the manager came over to drop off our check.  She never apologized and never once said that they would make changes and actually look for crabs in their oysters. She approached the entire situation with as much care as a short order cook that put mayonnaise on a burger by mistake.   When I showed her the pics of the creature on my phone, she laughed and said these exact words "Well, at least you have a fun story to tell". And she is absolutely correct. I tell everyone the story and it goes something like this:  We went to Donovan's Chop House in Phoenix and found a living parasite inside one of the oysters we just ate.  The manager waited a full hour before coming to our table and laughed off our experience as a "fun story".  After being freaked out by finding a living creature in our food, the most she did for us was to knock $12 off of our $250 bill and did the bare minimum to make the situation right.  Great story huh Donovan's?  Here are the pics:  http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201321.jpg http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201207.jpg http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201303.jpg    The rest of the food was good, but not amazing. The special of the day was a $68 pasta which was the best part of the meal.

Thank God for tourists and trendy people wanting trendy cupcakes. Without either this place would flop!!!  I always see a line out the door and figured that Sprinkles cupcakes HAD to be amazing. I live right down the street and find myself walking by quite often, but after 3 visits and 3 mediocre cupcakes I realized why there is always a 15 minute wait; the teenagers that work behind the counter are ill trained and take longer to put a cupcake in a box, than it does Starbucks to make a complex specialty coffee.  To top it off, each time I visited, the overprices cupcakes were hardly stocked and I had to settle for my second choice. The cakes tasted decent but were a touch dry.  Fun to look at but not much more.  Don't get me wrong, I love cupcakes as much as the next 30's something hipster yuppie, but had it not been for an extraordinary location with a high volume of tourist based pedestrian traffic, Sprinkles would not be making it based on the quality of their cupcakes. It is a good thing for them that everyone that walks by this location is transient. The idea is great but this company would not survive on local business alone.  The owners are very fortunate that they have been able to ride the coattails of other trendy and worthy cupcake companies. Had the cupcake trend not existed before Sprinkles opened, they surely would not have started the trend themselves, and would have fizzed out within months of opening

What started out as a lovely evening quickly headed south once the food arrived. Don't get me wrong. The menu blew me away. Creative dishes. Perfectly writtten descriptions of appetizers that SOUNDED like they would dance on my tongue. Nope. Not here.  The food arrived and though it was good (one notch above "decent") it was... Small. I ordered the salmon. All 3 ounces of it. My fiancee went with the filet which, in all of its glory might have been 4 oz.  The veggies were overcooked and as with the main entree, sparce. Our drinks were only refilled once and we left wishing we had not just spent $100 on a meal that was fit for a hobbit.

Everything I have to say about Fogo de Chao, in Scottsdale is 100% amazing! I have been to 4 different Fogo chains. This one is by far the best. The service, impeccable. The food, perfect and consistent. The price... Who cares?!?!!  I have been to this location close to 20 times and every time, Pure Gold!!!

Service was terrible Drinks went unfilled. Customers that came in after us, got their pizza before us. In the 2 hours we were there (yes, it took that long) the manager visited every table at least twice, but never once came to see us. In fact, he visited the table right next to use 3 times, since a two different couple sat there before we even got our meal.  Too bad we don't speak Italian. The manager practically bent over backwards when his Italian friends showed up. I think most of our servers attention went to that table. Unfortunately, the showed up after we were already there an hour.. Pizza was good but service was terrible.

I used to go to this restaurant before the owner changed the name. Same owner, same great food, same awesome atmosphere. We had just gotten back from a trip to Italy and were constantly disappointed with all the Italian restaurants in Scottsdale. Nothing came close to Rome or Sicily until we found T. Roosevelt's Don't let the new name fool you. This place is "upscale casual with a forever family vibe"  "Welcoming" would be a good way to put it!  The pizza is UNGODLY AMAZING!  The crust they use is the best crust I ever had on a pizza The antipasti plate is huge, and has more meats and cheese than anyone could ever want. The steaks, fish, and pasta are to die for.  I have never had anything I did not LOVE. Don't let the name fool you. T. Roosevelt's has the best Italian food in Scottsdale.  and holy crap!! the deserts!?!? Ridiculous  Pros: Attentive staff Amazing appetizers  Great bar Fun owner Incredible pasta Sexy ambiance   Con's They don't do breakfast.  I cannot recommend this place enough!

Clean, ambient, professional, healing refreshing and very affordable. What else can be said?  I am a spa junkie and have been getting (on average) two massages per week, for the last 4 years.  After moving to old town Scottsdale a year ago, I was excited when I saw a new massage house opening near me.  I have been there 4 times now and have loved it every time! The therapists are well trained, and professional The ambiance is great, and the price is half as much as they should be charging.  I read a review left by Larry L. complain that he paid more the second time around. I guess he did not realize that they give a discount on your first time.  Without a doubt, this is my favorite massage studio in all of Scottsdale.

Great ambiance, awesome appetizers, fantastic pizza, flawless customer service. Evo has it all. What was really nice and unexpected is that the owner visited our table and chatted with us for 15 minutes, asking for way to improve the service, the food and the feel of the place. He was very interested in what we had to say. We have since eaten at Evo 2 more times and will go back many more.
