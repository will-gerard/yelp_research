Postino is possibly my favorite place in the Valley.  The wine list is divine, the apps are delightful, the setting is relaxed but not too casual. The happy hour can't be beat, but it gets packed fast.  The bruschetta is nearing infamy at this point. I've never had a bad experience, and even hosted my sister's bridal shower here once. Love, love, love this place.  The downtown location is newer and super cute, and the food is just as great as the one on Campbell.

i just love this little store. it ranks high among places i like to go and spend hours lost in my own head, dreamily paging through countless old books. the selection is marvelous, and the prices are fantastic. i'm sort of a sucker for used bookstores anyway. i mean, how could there be a BAD one? i never bring anything to trade because i keep every book that i buy and have a pretty impressive little collection, but they seem to give pretty good deals when you do bring trades in. you can also just donate, which i suspect happens a lot given the location of the store.

My carpets look brand new!! My daughter's tears over spilled gatorade lasted longer than the bright red stain thanks to Horizon! They were on time, very friendly on the phone and when they showed up, quick and the job was very well done. We'll be calling regularly.

this is our favorite sushi spot in the west valley. great happy hour! and my little sister tells me the quail eggs are delicious (she's braver than i am). i've had most of the sushi rolls (love the marilyn mon-roll), the tempura vegetables, udon noodles, stuffed jalepenos. they also have this amazing drink - the ultimate gin and tonic. it's gin, infused with rose petals and cucumber, and tonic and it's delicious. kid friendly, inexpensive, craving smashing, yummy sushi spot! never too busy, large patio - can't really go wrong.

I could work out anywhere, it doesn't really matter to me. I do the stair climbers, use the bikes, run sometimes, and use the weight machines. I come here in particular because the women in the daycare are so amazing to my daughters! Erica was among the few people I would even leave my babies with at all. She is the sweetest, as are all the girls there, and my daughters love going!

I've been duped by LivingSocial. While I'm usually quite pleased with my "scores", this was not a deal. In fact, it probably would have been cheaper full price elsewhere with all the upcharges and fees. The glasses included in the deal were suitable for the likes of Sarah Palin and Jeffrey Dahmer, but I like to consider myself pretty fashionable and there was only ONE pair in the whole store I would even wear. My deal included 2 pairs, so I got something decent that I'll only wear on the couch. They were also a day late and then the girl was late to open the store on Sunday morning so my husband was sitting in the mall waiting for her. Pretty sure 11am is a little late in the day to not be to work on time. Rude. I will say that the eye doctor doing the exam was very professional and nice. That's the only plus. He should take his expertise elsewhere. This place sucked.

would it be too brief to simply proclaim "best place ever!"? ok, fine.  how about elaborating by saying order thee green salad and the kung pao bowl or some "wings"?  they are so good, you'll thank me later.  you dont' have to be vegan to appreciate the yummy-ness.

I'm conflicted on how to review this animal rescue. I would never want to discourage anyone from adopting a dog from a rescue, and would like to continue to see dogs get adopted out from here to good, loving homes. That being said, this animal rescue made me very sad. The dogs are residing in absolute filth. The pens, that hold about 10-15 dogs collectively are soiled, wet with urine, mud, and who knows what else. Even the floors in the main hallway are covered with filth. The smell when you walk in is assaulting to your senses. The conditions are like no other rescue/shelter I've ever been to before. We DID end up adopting a dog because we felt horrible to leave without saving one, and we are very happy with him but we're working on getting him healthy. Instead of telling you not to adopt a dog from here, I would almost urge you to so they are in a better environment. The rescue is doing a good thing, but going about it very poorly. The woman seemingly in charge is abrupt, rude and arrogant. I guess I expected someone oozing with compassion, and she is far from that. She was actually amoung the rudest people I've encountered in recent memory. They don't answer the phone with any indication that it's an animal rescue, and then snapped on me when I asked if I had reached the correct line. They don't greet you with any sort of friendliness when you arrive, but I guess that's not what they're there for. Perhaps they could at least clean the pens so these poor dogs who have all been through tremendous hardships could lay their heads down on a clean, albeit cold, tile floor. Just very sad.

I would like to formally preface this review by announcing that my love for Jimmy John's is only eclipsed by the love I have for my family and kids.  I've eaten at Jimmy John's franchises in Florida, Illinois, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, and typically anytime I find one anywhere in between.  JJ's was my #1 pregnancy craving with my two babies.  It was a huge reason I've felt homesick for the midwest (before locations started sprinkling the Phoenix valley). Look at my facebook page!  My profile pic, in two different instances, is me with my JJ's sub or cup!  I have the JJ's party cups in my cupboard, and I hate clutter, hodgepodge, and crap! People CALL me when they see new locations.  I mean, an ex-boyfriend called me years after we'd broken up to tell me he saw one downtown, and he just knew I loved it so much I should know this!  (Duh, I totally already knew, and I told him to lose my number.)  That being said, I have officially experienced my first poor sub from any franchise, any time of day or night, any city, at this one on Bell.  It pains me to disclose that my utterly perfect sub (#10 with dijon and sprouts) can actually be disgusting. And at the location nearest to my house! I was shocked, heartbroken and bemused. How could it be??  Because of my intense loyalties to this chain, I can assure you I will be back.  But, my rose colored glasses are off, and my dear beloved JJ no longer ranks first in my heart of men who've never let me down.  It's a sad sad day, folks.

Chai = decent. Parfait = YUCK!   I ordered a large vanilla soy chai tea and it was ready before my parfait. As I sipped my treat I recognized how nice it is to have an independent coffee shop in the far west valley finally! When I got my parfait I wondered how long they'd be open. The strawberries were "topping" strawberries smothered in that funky jelly. And I suspected the blueberries were previously frozen because they were nearly dehydrated and flavorless.   Bottom line: they have a drive thru and I have two kids so I'm sure I will be back for coffee in a crunch.
