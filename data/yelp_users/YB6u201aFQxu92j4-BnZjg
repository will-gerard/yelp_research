I brought my laptop here to get repaired on Thursday. They finally called me back this morning (Saturday) and told me it would be $256 to remove a virus! I can get a new laptop for $300!  I declined the repair and the tech or whoever it was on the phone seem to get real short with me once I did not want to get it repaired.   The reviews on yelp or Best Buy aren't that great maybe I should have listened to them.

We went here after the terrible balloon Halloween festival (please read my review on that) and it was a pleasant surprise.   Although we had 10 kids with us were a little weary of bringing them to a sports bar. It turned out to be great. There were others in there with kids and the bar is just loud enough so you can't hear bratty kids screaming and the food was just to their liking.   I had a mushroom burger and a Greek salad that was very good and my hubby had wings which he said were second to none.   My only gripe is that we had to wait a little longer but to be honest that should be expected on a Saturday night when you come in with 14 people.   Overall I highly recommend this place!

Had a burger and a side salad here. I always love Wendy's burgers and a burger with a side salad I think is just the right combination of healthy.   Thanks Wendy's!

Always great at this location!  Just got the broiled trio so I don't get too much fried food.  Waiter is amazing. We have two kids with us so we needed to order quickly and he took care of everything and got us out in 20 minutes. This place is great!  The only reason they're not getting five stars is because Red Lobster does tend to be a bit pricey for what you get.

When we're not counting calories we go here. The food tends to be not so health-conscious, it is good old comfort food. Is not the best but it's also not the worst the food and the service are very consistent and the cheesy hashbrowns are very yummy.   I actually prefer Village Inn but Cracker Barrel is a close second

I wouldn't not use Chas Roberts for your air-conditioning needs.   According to my husband we had a small fan go out of one of our units since there was a Chas Roberts sticker on the unit that's who I called.   The technician came out told me it would be $700 since it is so hot out they have you over a barrel (this was in July) so I said go ahead and fix it. He was out there 10 minutes and when he came back in the air was blowing cold. I said, "hold on $700 for the fan and 10 minutes worth of work". "He said yes that's what we charge." So I paid him but then I complained to the corporate headquarters and tehy must have agreed because that same technician brought me back out a check for $400!   So in the end it only cost me $300 to get the fan changed in the middle of summer which is okay but I had to go through a bunch of arguing and complaining to get that.   I can understand everybody needs to make a living but gouging consumers in the middle of summer is ridiculous!

I get the spinach and chicken salad here about once a week. It is very good and if I don't add a ton of dressing it is also pretty healthy! Additionally, it is a large enough portion that I am able to save some for later.  At about $9 it's somewhat expensive for a salad and a drink but the healthier options usually are.

We go here on every Cardinals home game and always have a great time! We usually tailgate on the great lawn and the atmosphere combined with the live band combined with the food is second to none.  I will say that we don't tailgate too often in August and September but from then on the weather is great so we are there on Sundays!  Now is far as the Cardinals winning that's a whole different story............

My wonderful in-laws took me here for a late birthday present. (My birthday was several months ago) I had the fillet topped with blue cheese and it was outstanding!   I've been to this place three times and every time it was nothing but extraordinary.   It is a little pricey but if you have a few extra bucks and are hungry (I always am!) I highly reccomend that you stop by here if you're in the Scottsdale area.

This is a terrrible store! I went in to simply buy Milk. They had the isle closed off  and when I finally did get the milk the lines were so long it took me 20 minurtes just ot buy a 1/2 gallon of milk. Next time I will go to Fry's

I shop here when I need something extra special to wear.   Recently my husband and I were going on special date (it was 10 years since our first date) so I wanted something nice but didn't want to get a divorce over the price,. so I went to Muse. Victoria helped me (she's the owner). We found a perfect little black dress type number (although it is red) for me with matching heels (already had those).   Not too expensive, around $100. Most importantly my husband thought I looked smoken hot!   Thanks Victoria!

We go here quite often and the service and food is always very good. My wife likes to get the dinner for two which includes an appetizer soup dinner and dessert because for $40 deal can't be beat at a place like this.  I would suggest trying the beef with broccoli and sweet and sour soup both of those are my favorites.   This time I had one of the new salads, The vietnamese one one I believe. It was a lot of salad I don't really recommend this one.   Overall a really fun place!

We ate here last night before the hockey game. It was very good as usual if you can stand the wait. I had the pepper crusted Gorgonzola burger, my hubby had the mac & cheese, which he said is the best in town!  I keep track of everything I eat so I really splurged on this 1500 cal burger and also at $13 it is pretty expensive for a burger, but man is this thing good!  The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is because we had to wait for a table which is not unusual Westgate but also because we didn't see our server for the first 15 minutes that we sat down. Once we did get her attention she was very quick, got us to hockey game on time and did everything else very well.   If you're in Westgate, it's not too crowded and you have a few extra bucks, I recommend this Yardhouse.

My husband and I went here tonight with the kids. As usual the food was very good.  Right now they have a special deal going where you order two entrees, one to dine in and another entr√©e to take home. My husband and I both got this. I got the Italian duo and decided to take home a shrimp dish my hubby got the Parmesan crusted chicken and took home the spaghetti.   Our server did very well and took care of us (and sometimes that's not easy with two young kids!) I don't know about he rest of you but I prefer male waiters, they seem to do a better job, just my opinion.  Anyway, we go to this Olive Garden all the time and we only had a bad experience one time so that's pretty good. I know the Olive Garden gets a bad rap among italian restaurants but we really like this one!

I just had the weirdest thing happen. A lady came up and said she'd like to pay for my gas and did.   That was so cool and deserves an awesome review or something.!.  Not sure where to post this so I guess I'll just write a favorable review for the gas station!

We went to Richardson's last night because we had some family in town and wanted to treat them to a nice dinner.   They did not disappoint. I had the fish special which had swordfish, mahi mahi and salmon and it was simply delightful. For some of the older folks in my family some of the menu was off-limits because of the spiciness but that's not true for me!   I will be visiting this establishment again and suggest you do too, if you have a few extra bucks. (A little pricey)

I know these places get a bad rap all the time but this one here is delicious!  My hubby and I stopped by here after the ASU win on Saturday (GO ASU) and just picked up a few tacos.   They were delicious and hit the spot. I had a beef taco and he had two chicken tacos. Very filling for an after game snack and for around $7 you can't beat it!

I went here on Saturday with some of my girlfriends and as usual the food was excellent. Surprisingly this one by PV mall did not have a wait on Saturday afternoon. Usually I try and avoid Oregano's due to the wait. But if you can get in without waiting an hour it is definitely worth a stop.  My favorite here is the thin crust chicken and pineapple pizza. It might not sound awesome but it is! You should give it a try

I normally don't leave that many negative reviews but my advice is not to go here. during dinner hours.  My husband likes this place so I stopped to get takeout and so far I have waited 30 minutes for two chicken teriyaki bowls.   Keep in mind I have waited less than most as there's probably 15 people in line and they have three people working.   Additionally I don't even think the food is that good. I don't get it

I agree with all of the reviews on here.   This "festival" is not worth attending and we will be skipping it next year.   The parking is atrocious. We ended up having to illegally exit the parking lot just to be able to get out of the parking lot within three hours, seriously!   Additionally, the whole festival is a lawsuit waiting to happen as these balloons are not secured and a good wind will send one of them coming down to the ground or crushing a kid.   There's way more people in this place than it can hold safely and on top of that there is very little to no organization to the event.  Overall just a terrible experience.
