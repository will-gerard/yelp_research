Terrible service.  We were seated and drinks ordered at 5:15pm by 6:40pm the only think I had received was bread and my alcoholic beverage. Was in the area for my son's football game and couldn't even get the check fast enough to make it to the game on time.  Very disappointed.   It wasn't even busy.  :(

Always seems to be busy here. I still stop,  the employees are always so pleasant and helpful AND they will get you thru the line in no time. :) I like Frys sales. Very pleased with this location!

Great stop! Family owned and operated. BEST fish tacos around!  Taco Tuesday here every week! I'm not a big fan of the salsa,  but everything else is on point!  Delish!

Lunch choice for the work crew today. First time for me! I got some cheese curds that were amazing! Buffalo chicken tenders were definitely not for the wimpy! I found them to be quite spicy. To spicy for me. The butter burger though, was really yummy! To top all that off, $1 rootbeer float today!!

Being from Chandler, you went to this place knowing the family or someone that worked there. Now it's SWEETS, and we couldn't be happier! Still great "family" atmosphere. Food is yummy and the ice cream is on point! As a family, the ice cream trips just got better!! Burgers, Chicken strips, soft and hard ice cream! Try it for yourself!! Not to disappoint!
