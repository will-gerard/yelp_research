If you haven't caught on yet, get the mussels! I was very hesitant at first because all I had heard about mussels were that they were generally slimy and hard to swallow. Not here! They were AMAZING! The broth that they are in is easily THE best broth I have ever had! I ate at least two of their bowls of bread dipped in the broth alone! Absolutely delicious.

I don't even know why I bother trying this one over and over. Without fail, every time I come here they take FOREVER! It's seriously the longest wait in a drive thru I have ever had, even if there are only a few cars. Next time I'm going to drive a few miles out of the way and still get my drink faster than it would have been to sit in this line. Plus they messed up my drink this past time. Worst sonic I have ever been to

The sweet potato cannelloni was SO delicious! It might as well have been a dessert with how sweet it was! We also had three bruschetta: the strawberry and apple, prosciutto and fig, and the fresh mozzarella. They were all yummy but the fresh mozzarella was magical! The tomato jam on it was the best tomato jam I have ever had. Loved this place and I will definitely be going back! :)

We ordered the mellowterranian, Maui wowi, and the Thai dye pizzas! All of them were good but the Thai Dye was easily the best! SOOO delicious!
