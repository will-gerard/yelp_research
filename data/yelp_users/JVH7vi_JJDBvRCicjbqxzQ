I saw Denise for the second time and am very happy with her work. She is REALLY good at doing layers. Definitely one of the more expensive haircuts I've gotten but I think it's worth it.  I'm really picky too and I think she does a really great job understanding exactly what you're looking for. I also have pretty long hair and I've read some other reviews and it looks like everyone with long hair is very happy with Denise's work...soooo if you do have long hair, you need to see Denise.

Soooo let me first off start by saying I am SO SAD I discovered these guys my last year of living in Arizona, and if you ever need anything done with your car, YOU MUST COME HERE. Quick back story: I went to a very well known company (who I will leave unnamed) to get a $20 oil change bc I was a bit of a sucker and trying to get a good deal. They came out and told me I had about a million things wrong with my car and I'd be looking at spending a few grand. I was not amused with this and also doubted them since my car was running perfectly fine and there were no leaks etc etc, so I went to First Auto to get a look over and second opinion. Multiple people had recommended me to them and I'd be there once before so felt very comfortable going back again. These guys are extremely thorough and extremely HONEST. I have never dealt with such a fair company either. Turns out nothing needed to be fixed with my car and they saved me so much money by not trying to trick me into fixing unnecessary things. They even gave me a ride to and from my apartment. I worked with Ray the first time I came here and then Keith the second time and they are both awesome. I really don't have enough good things to say about these guys. And if you don't believe me, when you go into the office there, you'll see the place is completely covered with thank you letters from hundreds of people who also appreciate their honesty and efficiency.  So to sum up this small novel, if you need anything done to your car, this is the place to go. They will be 100% honest, efficient, helpful and easy to deal with. I am sad they aren't located to where I'm moving in California. So if you live in Arizona, take advantage of how awesome this place is.

Maybe this was just a really off day but I came here with four coworkers and waited an hour and fifteen minutes for our food. There was only one person working so I'm assuming someone didn't show up to work. I felt bad for her at first since she was the only one working, and I thought we were all very polite and patient but she was blatantly rude and angry at us.  After waiting an hour and a half for a smoothie and salad, you'd think she'd say "thanks for waiting" or "sorry about the delay", but she did not say one word and basically just mean mugged us. And I never have a bad review. Will not be returning.
