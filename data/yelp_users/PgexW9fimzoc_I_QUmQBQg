It's in a shady-ish area but I've never had any problems coming here by myself late at night- 1-2-3am.  Side story- There used to be a lot of cats that lived behind the Chevron and walked around but it seems like they moved on in recent months.   I've never had a problem with the workers - always fast and friendly or the food. (I've gotten food poisoning from Taco Bell twice yuck!)  Great menu with all the things and veggie options (stuff without meat) like the Crunchtada! Which I just tried today and will def get again. Btw- Green sauce is where it's at. And all of this for an amazing price and it's open 24hrs!  I wish there was one closer in Scottsdale!  Always delish on the cheap.

This location of my sisters closet is not as nice as the other locations I've been to. It smelled like a Goodwill. I've found nicer & brand new name brand clothes for cheaper at Macy's. I'm talking Calvin Klein tops for less than $15 from Macy's. I will say there was a good selection of clothes and shoes but unless you are a size small to medium good luck finding anything here. The place is small and it seemed like the items they consign are a lot of less than desirable ones.

Hidden off the 51 & Glendale. Big place & big patio. Meh food. Chips & salsa ok. Skip the queso. Vegetarians BEWARE everything is made w/ meat. Beans AND noodle stuff. Ugh. Safe w/ grilled veggies. :(

The ladies here were helpful making my niece's Smurfette come to life. The whole experience is fun for the little ones and there are a million options of characters, clothes and accessories -almost too much to choose from.  You can just buy the shell and come back and get it filled and personalized like we did. Don't forget to get your birth certificate before you leave. :)

Me: Do you guys want to meet us at Randy's when you are done with going to garage sales? Mom: Yes that's nice I miss Randy  Above is a real convo between my mother and I about going to Randy's for bfast. We absolutely love this place.  Awesome friendly service, food was great as usual and the price is right.   Bring cash and they will not seat you if your party isn't all there yet.   I love this place!

This is were you go when you have no options left late late at night. I've been here a few times but mostly to get free slurpees when they have promotions. Use the app to find out when they have deals going on like all the free stuff they gave away this past summer every weekend with no purchase necessary! Awesome!  I got a slice of cheese pizza here once it wasn't bad- maybe a step above a totino's party pizza only because I didn't have to cook it myself. :P

Home Depot -enough said. If you need a hammer they got it. If you need some plants they have it. If you need a ladder it's right there! The prices are decent- I'm sure you can go to a cheaper store or even Amazon but they have more variety and specialized materials for all your home improvement needs.

This place is always poppin' off since it's practically the only gas station for miles it seems. It also has a smoke shop to get your smokes at low Rez prices so that's prolly the reason too. I come here only for the Coke Freestyle when I need a fizzy lifting drink. The workers are usually friendly and fast - prices are fair and that's all I would ask of them.

I love this Safeway.  They have a deli, Starbucks, a bakery and even a bar in the back.  Its always clean, stocked and organized.  They have a great produce section and a large selection of organic produce too.  I love the floral section -lots of pretty arrangements.   They have $5 pastry trays and cookie trays for your last minute office/work treats.  Do yourself a favor and get the Safeway App. You can save lots of $ and it's easy to use.

Some good patio sittin' in the non smoking section. I love the 90's throw back Alt Rock musical selections.  This place is clean and the menus aren't sticky- food crusted disgusting and the benches aren't scary to sit on like their camelback sister location.  The service is decent and our drinks were never empty. I like the happy hour & reverse specials but didn't like the price increase a few months back (maybe it's been a year?) :(

One of the main reasons why I like eating here is that my fiancé and I can find things for both of us to eat. I can get meat free dishes and he can get meat dishes unlike other chain restaurants - Applebee's = sad face --they have little to no meat free dishes not even a damn veggie burger? Ugh. But that's besides the point.  :(  Now back to the awesomeness of Chili's...   I usually chow down on the bottomless chips & salsa, soup and salad. It's on the lunch menu but you can get it for dinner for a few dollars more. I always get the potato soup without the bacon and a house salad. They have new sides on the menu - I also ordered the asparagus and tomatoes and it was great.  The soup is awesome - always hot with chunks of potatoes and topped with cheese, the salad is always fresh and the chips are thin (a good thing) brought to you warm and enough for the whole table to share.  Don't be shy asking for more soup (try the different flavors even) or salad they are happy to get you more.   In past visits I've had the black bean burger which is awesome too. I've tried the margherita flatbread and I will never make that mistake again. It wasn't worth the price and the flavor was not to my liking.  The service is always good -friendly servers - no problems - now they have the newish tablet thingys at the table to pay for your meal, order more drinks, see the menu, play games etc. It's nice to pay the check when we are ready but we end up turning it around - it's a little distracting personally.  Chili's has something for everyone and sign up for the email club and get coupons for free apps and desserts!

I was always a little hesitant to come to this location since I've been to the Tempe location a few times and had to wait what seemed like forever to get a table to only give up and give in to sitting at the bar. Plus the parking is terrible there too.  So we came here on a Friday night and I was pleasantly surprised that we got seated upstairs right away with a view of front door and video golf. Parking is not a real concern here since it is in a shopping area.  Our waitress was friendly and prompt with refilling our drinks and our food took a reasonable amount of time to come out too. I ordered the Portabella Veggie Beer Bread and fries. Delicious! It comes is a wrap like vehicle for your mushroom, zucchini, carrot, sun-dried tomato, broccoli, mozzarella, pesto concoction. I'm not really into mushrooms but they weren't overwhelming and blended in with the other veggies.  It was awesome and more than enough food for one person and definitely worth the price.  I will definitely come back and I forgot how good this place is!!!

I've been going to Rivera Opticare for the last 4 years except when I moved Downtown from Mesa and decided to try another optical place which was a huge mistake. But that's another yelp review... Anyways so when my next eye appointment was coming around again I wanted to come back to Riveria ASAP.  The staff is always friendly and my one reason for coming back is Dr. Tracy. She is the best eye doctor I've ever had. She explains everything going on with your eyes and is just so great to work with.  She puts you at ease and makes you laugh and just makes the process painless and entertaining!   During my visit I got my eyes dilated which was included in my exam and I could drive after with sunglasses and my vision was only a little fuzzy when looking at things close up but didn't last very long. I remember it being worse to see and drive after years ago.   They have a good selection of eyeglass frames -tip- If you like a frame but not the color ask if they have the frame in other colors. I've done this and they are more than willing to look it up for you.   Another tip is to make sure you confirm your appointment when they send you a card in the mail, call, text you. I forgot and they cancelled my appt. My fault of course but I called and was able to get another easily. It's just business.   If you refer someone they also give you a $10 referral bonus. Score!    Long story short - Dr. Tracy is awesome and I highly recommend this place!

Came back for my yearly exam and still an excellent experience. They contacted me 4 ways (text to confirm, snail mail, email and I think they even called me) to make sure I'm still coming to my appointment. Just like any business time is money. So make sure you confirm!  Dr. Tracy is still super awesome and she is a hoot!  I actually can wait to come back next year! :P

Top Dog always does an awesome job with our 2 Shih Tzus. We have been going here for almost 7 years and never had a bad cut or concerns. The boys always go in looking like disheveled homeless dogs on the aspca commercials and come out like they are ready for boot camp. The groomers are friendly and are great with our little pups. If you are particular about your cut just make sure they know specifically what you want. We always want our little guys short in the face and body and longer tail and ears and the do exactly our request.  We usually don't have a problem with getting an appointment because they have a lot of groomers but close to holidays everyone and their dog is trying to get puppy cuts so keep that in mind. :D

This Starbucks is on point except one time...but they made it right so I'm willing to forgive and forget. :P This is my go to Starbucks I used to go about once a week but my work got a new fancy coffee maker that I can use for free so my frequency has gone down lately.  This place is always buzzing just like any Starbucks and everyone is friendly and my drink is always consistent.  Get the Starbucks App use it to pay and rack up those stars to get free drinks etc. also look out for their emails for discounts promos etc.  Loves it!

All of the sonics are slow. It's their charm I guess. The side effect of cooking fresh food? Hmm.  I love the diet cherry limeades but sometimes waiting more than 5 minutes for one isn't worth my time.  They have some crazy concoction of drinks and mocktails-ha! and they are only worth the cash during happy hour.  I switched it up yesterday and got the frozen cherry limeade and I swear my teeth almost disintegrated. I tried to cut it with some water but it was way to sweet and gave me a headache. Never straying from the DCL again.  I have ordered a grilled cheese from this location -it was pretty standard not bad or praise worthy.  I don't really like the drive thru situation - the workers have to walk all the way outside to get the money and give your food. If you pay with a card it take even more time since they have to go all the way back in to run it. It's 2015 can we fix this? They have the card readers on the stalls at other places -c'mon.  They had a fire a few months ago and I tried to get a DCL before work and they were closed but a worker came out and handed me a voucher for a FREE medium drink. Score! Not their fault for the fire but it was nice of them to do this for their customers trying to get their sonic on.

What's not to love about IKEA?  You can find all your inexpensive and stylish home goods in one place!  You get what you pay for enough said.  Don't forget to hit the AS-IS section on the bottom floor there are some gems there sometimes half the price and already assembled if you don't mine minor dings and such.  The cheese pizza is surprisingly good and frozen yogurt & cinnamon rolls are always yummy.

I've been coming to Amazing Jakes for over 7 years and it sad to see the deterioration of this place. I remember coming here around 2009 and the buffet was terrible -the pizza was awful and the salad bar was disgusting but since then the buffet has shaped up and offers some really great options for your little rabbits. But the dessert side was pitiful on this trip -I didn't even bother. A few sugar cookies, sugar cinnamon chips? and soft serve -not like brownies, rice crispy treats of yesteryear. :(   Question: Why is the obvious room (kids tv & movies) that everyone sits in seems like the smallest one out of all of theme rooms?   The games are mostly broken or about to fall apart -see photo. The rides seem ok -my nieces (9&4) always have a good time riding them.  I don't stand too close to that rollercoaster thing since some little kid upchucking on me wouldn't be cute.  It seems like the popular ride is the go-carts but the track is way too small.  I was sad to see on this trip they closed the mini golf area -why? Seems like they could put some more rides in there or even a bigger track for the go-carts!? The bowling alley part is nice - in the past I have played but not on this trip.  The toddler area needed a good vacuum -go ahead vacuum and Stanley steamer the whole place please!   I only come here when I don't pay full price (reduced for company events etc) and I don't think I will come if I have to pay full price for everything.

Don't get me wrong I love me some Jason's Deli but I was hoping they got their act together since our last visit (dirty restrooms & dining area) to our surprise it is very clean/remodeled now! Yay!   The salad bar is always awesome, fresh and a wide variety of veggies.   Pro tip: use the self serve checkout thingy - soup and salad bar kiosk, skip the line of people getting sandwiches and such.    Don't forget your free soft serve cone on your way out!

My niece and I started coming here over 4 years ago and we always get the Honey Green Tea Boba-Bubble Tea.  We have been to other bubble tea places in the valley but nothing can compare to the Honey Green Tea here. We don't really care about the other flavors (we love the honey too much!) but they have a long list of them.  We have also watched the art work grow on the wall and the tables over the years. I always bring a sharpie with me so my niece can doodle. We even check on the little jellyfish she drew about 2 years ago -still there!  We always come after school so around the afternoon time and the last few times it was busy but this trip a few people popped in ordered ramen and bubble drinks to-go so it was quite and they were playing some good tunes -overall a good way to spend a warm afternoon.  We love this place! :D

Happy hour is so awesome here compared to other sushi places on happy hour. The veggie gyoza and the veggie rolls are awesome and even better when it's half the price.  Parking sucks and sometimes a wait for a table but it's all worth it. The waitress gets real busy so keep your cool too.  Come Sunday for all day HH and eat and drink all the things! Go Go!

This is my main Target but I like to go to other ones as well. There's always a clearance section with some good finds. Parking is rarely a problem and this location is not as busy as other ones. But when the Snowbirds come back you can tell.   It's always clean and organized and the bathrooms are not horrible as they tend to get. The workers are always helpful and friendly and seem like they actually like working there unlike other stores.

We visited on a busy Saturday night and waited awhile as expected to get seated. I decided to treat my Niece for her birthday and we came here only for the cheesecake -her favorite. We mentioned to the very nice and patient waitress the occasion. I encourage my nieces ages 10 & 4 to order for themselves -I think it helps further down the road etc. and soon enough they brought out a huge piece of chocolate cake for the little one and a huge piece of s'mores cheesecake for my older niece. Since it was my nieces birthday the waitress and another waiter sang happy birthday. Both cakes were excellent and tasted excellent. Needless to say we all got cake fatigued and took boxes home. I plan on making it her birthday tradition to come here.  Everything was awesome except the prices but it was worth it and a nice little treat.

I like my cheap food even cheaper so I wait for the junk mail and lo and behold COUPONS FOR SUBWAY!  I love that I customize my sammie just the way I like it. Pro tip: I usually get my lunch and dinner at the same time before work -a foot long. So I get the sandwiches made with different ingredients so I feel like I had two completely different meals for the day. Different cheeses for example and one with sweet onion one with mayonnaise etc. I'm glad my sandwich artist never gives me a hard time with my order when I ask for one of the veggie patties not heated so I can heat it up later for dinner. Perfect! I've never had an issue at this location but my only complaint is SMELLING like subway for hours after I've only been inside for 5 minutes. Lol. :P

This my second visit to this location but this time for sure I know I won't be back. I like that they have late night hours but that also comes with the possibility of aged food etc.  On my last visit I stopped in and ordered the veggie sandwich which is just cheese, avocado and lettuce -you can get tomato and sprouts too. The sandwich was a sandwich nothing special but the service was iffy. This time we stopped in around midnight on a weekend night and as my beau went in to order I knew we made a huge mistake. I watched the worker not only wipe his nose with his hand but also take his hat off and scratch his hair near the food counter. (No sandwiches were being made at the time) Now this was not the worker that made our sandwiches -maybe he delivers orders or does the register? Who knows but I'm sure he needs to retake a food safety class.  As we make our way home I'm a little worried about the choice we made for our late night meal. We get home I'm secretly scared to open the bag and being super hungry - I just do it. The first thing I notice is the brown sludge seeping out of the sandwich -the "avocado" spread. EWW. Being so hungry and the fact that I already put a bra on to go get our late night munchies - I just scraped the brown goopy parts off and choked down the dry crusty wheat bread and my dignity -praying that I wouldn't get food poisoning.  Turns out...this time...I have a gut of a goat and I was fine but still have flashbacks of terrible terrible sandwich. At least the Mrs. Vickie's BBQ chips tasted awesome.  I've learned my lesson and never again. They should have an "At your own risk" sign on the door.  The End.

Veg burrito was ok, needed more cheese and flavor. Service was meh. Don't expect them to get your order right if you want it different than what's on the menu. I.E. no guac etc. I had higher hopes. :(

I first decided to go to EWC for the location and the fact that they offered the first wax free and since then I've been going to this location for almost 2 years.  I don't trust anyone with my eyebrows except Desiree. She is awesome.   The waxing process for me is not painful or scary and doesn't seem to make my face red or irritated and the chipotle customers eating their burritos next door don't give me too weird of looks walking out.  Btw the parking sucks most of the time since this plaza is always! busy.  The only thing I can complain about is the scheduling - it seems like there's been more than three times that I've gotten a call asking of they could reschedule my appointment which is not her fault at all but sucks to make an appt. then they cancel it on you. The last time it happened I made an appt. a month in advance for right before I went on vacation and a few days before they cancelled on me and then told me she wasn't going to be in until days after I come back from vacation -almost a week. Total bummer summer so had to see another esthetician at another location -but for my connivence only. Again not her fault since they told me they were doing training etc.   All in all it's painless, not very expensive for what it's worth and if you don't have the time to do it yourself and they seem to have a "promotion" going on for 12 for the price of 9 or some crap like that the front desk girls seem to always peddle this-  finally I gave in and they do have payment plans for you ladies and gents on a budget.

Breakfast buffet review: it's well worth the price and a good selection of breakfast items including some Asian dishes too.  I ordered a coffee, OJ & water - so don't be shy on your drink selections.  We came about an hour before the breakfast buffet closed but there still was a good selection of food and they were putting out fresh stuff!

It's a nice casino but it's usually not my thing as of late. I had dinner at the Wandering Horse buffet and it was good. They have some big name acts come through here which is cool - you don't have to drive to Glendale or downtown Phoenix.  The place is kinda small kinda smokey just like any other casino I've been to this side of the Nevada border.  I usually stick to the 2¢-5¢ machines but they do have all sorts of games that I have yet to understand. If you want to play bingo -go to their sister casino Casino Arizona down the 101 they have a great bingo hall there.  At Talking Stick they have huge ballrooms for your convention/wedding needs. I've stayed in the hotel a few years ago and it was awesome. Upscale decor with a rain shower and a huge tub plus comfy beds fresh linens. It was up there on hotel stays and I've even stayed at the Trump hotel in Las Vegas - which I believe is a 5 star hotel. I think this place is nicer.   Tonight I gambled $2 and won $5. I cashed out and left. :P

Im sad that this placed closed since I just bought 2- $20 Groupons here. :( it was a great deal too!  Currently 9/1/15-- I got back $20 in groupon bucks in my account after emailing them for over a week and 3 emails later.  Still waiting on the other one since I gave it as a gift not sure if they are going to give me credit or ? I guess another theater company is taking over called Roadhouse Cinemas. See photo.

I love this Taco Bell! Everyone is nice and accommodating with the mods on my food.  They have lard free - so vegetarian friendly refried beans that I ask to be substituted instead of the beef in most of the items on the menu. Bam! Bean tacos! Bean crunch wrap supreme!  They also have breakfast -you can never go wrong with the California AM crunch wrap!  Rumor is that the cinnamon twists are really rotini noodles but I need to see the receipts! Either way they are too good to not order so treat yo self!   Keep an eye on the Diamondback's score! (Must get 5 runs & even if they lose) This season alone they have given away* 3 free tacos almost every other day and they have like a million games during the season. So if you like tacos and have $2 jush go**!      *with purchase of a large drink. **the day after the game between 4-6pm

I had a nail emergency in the 12th hour and was able to get my nails done 30 minutes before they closed on a Saturday evening right before an event. Awesome! The technician did a good job fixing my DIY home gel nail kit disaster.  The chairs for the pedicure area are a little awkward but I was in and out pretty fast.  Reasonable prices and a large selection of gel nail colors.

The Papa Verde was delish and the service was fast and friendly. The quesadilla was enough food to fill my gullet.  I got the Mason jar juice in the past and it was awesome. Yeah a tad more than I would pay for a quesadilla but please just try it and you'll see why. Awesome fresh flavors.

Always ALWAY$ the cheapest gas in the valley that I trust. I check Gas Buddy all the time!  I always fill up my little car here but prepare to wait more than 5-10-20 minutes on any given day and time.  But while your waiting - Pro Tip: Please have your Costco card and credit/debit card ready BEFORE it's your turn. I hated watching the gas guzzling hummer gym rat dude struggle to find payment in his wallet AT the pump with 4 cars waiting.    - he was queued for 10+ minutes before his turn.    But if you forget your card just run into the main store and get a temp card and then the attendant will unlock the gassy goodness of Costco for you. I've even seen them pump gas for an elderly lady!

Mellow Mushroom will always have a special place in my heart since my fiancé and I had a lot of dates here in the past 4 years. We have been to all the locations in the valley and this one has a music theme.  It is located in a shopping/living/dining area next to Desert Ridge. There is comedy club a few doors down which is cool if go to a show you can come to reverse happy hour after. They have a nice patio and a huge bar and plenty of seating in the dining area for the whole crew.  I usually get a Groupon when we visit so I get a little bit of a discount on food and drinks. Sometimes other business give you a hard time about using Groupons but here it was a fast and easy transaction.  I ordered the Gourmet White and a Lil salad. The salad was crisp and fresh but I had to ask for croutons -which was just enough crunch to balance out the greens. The pizza it was okay but greasy from the cheese and only a few pieces of sun dried tomatoes. It was different from other white pizzas I've had in the past and not in a good way. Don't get me wrong -pizza is a food group for me but I've have better for cheaper. I've gotten the Funky Q Chicken with Jerk Tofu substituted in the past it was always on point. I should have stayed with my go-to this trip.  If you don't really like pizza sauce, veggies or meat then get the white pizza is just kinda too meh for me.  I love this place despite my wrong choice of pizza.

This place is great! We pulled in early and was assigned an area depending on if we wanted covered parking or not. Right away the shuttle pulled up while we were pulling our bags out of the car. The driver was very helpful and then after few stops we were whisked away to our terminal.  On our arrival back home -finding a shuttle back to the lot was a breeze and didn't wait at all. We were again whisked back to the lot and immediately to our car again the driver was very helpful with our bags.  On our way out to pay we each received water bottle and it was such an awesome treat since we were parched from our early morning (mostly sleeping) flight.  We used our AAA discount and got a great deal -so if you have AAA I recommend printing out the "coupon" from the AAA website.  We will definitely use this place again and it's better than inconveniencing your brother-cousin to drop you off at the airport and your sister yelling at you wondering where you are standing at the terminal doors.

I bought a Groupon a few months ago for a movie, laser tag and $10 arcade game play for 2. It was well worth the price I paid for the voucher. Sometimes while using a Groupon at the business you are never sure how to redeem it -where do I go? what do I do? - I thought. So I went right up to the movie counter and asked how I redeem it. They were happy to help and it was a fairly easy transaction and was able to redeem the rest of the voucher on the arcade side after the movie -easy peasy! Thank you for this -thought it was going to be a headache!  The theater was clean and seats were fairly comfortable for the regular no frills seats but leather. I usually bring a sweater or wear long sleeves at the movies cause it's usually freezing but it was just comfortable in there not icy cold like other theaters. The snacks (large popcorn, one medium drink & one large drink) were MORE expensive than the whole Groupon experience! Sounds about right.  :[   The arcade was a meh. Some of the games didn't work or looked like worked and just stole our monies. But we told the arcade workers and they were ok with putting the money back on our card. A good selection of games for the kids.   The laser tag area was cool but the gun can be tricky. The two story course is on par with other laser tag places like The Main Event in Chandler.   I would come back but it's too dang far for the experience I can can get closer to home but it was a nice little day trip down to Maricopa.

Yum! I got the Caprese salad and it was awesome. Mozzarella and pesto yes please! It was a good price for the size. I'm a little skeptical when it comes to salads since you can go to a salad buffet for like $6 but it was definitely worth it. I was also worried the dressing was going to be too tart or but it was perfect!  It's too bad it's out of my way to come back but if I'm in Gilbert this place would be the reason why.

This place is a dive but the food is awesome! If you skeeved out by an old building and furnishings then take your food to go. I was a little worried about the food being terrible but it was so good and my mother is a champion fry bread maker!   I took note of the sanitary aspects -hair nets and gloves. I get freaked out when I watch people make my food at restaurants but it was nice to know they are pretty sanitary despite the building being run down. Just in case you were worried.   My fry bread was FRESH not greasy and bigger than my face. I got the vegetarian taco which came with hatch chili -it was a little hotter than I like but not overwhelming. The lettuce was green and cheese didn't taste low grade aka imitation cheese or a "cheese like product". But next time I will probably get the regular taco because of spice.   Everyone was friendly, worth the price and I will definitely be back when my little mother refuses to make me fry bread.   Don't forget to check out little art market located inside with the natives selling their bead work, pottery and jewelry.

I went to a work function here so I didn't pay for anything -lucky me! Everyone was helpful when we needed drinks and when we had dinner in the banquet room. The banquet food was meh- we had BBQ but the only thing I could eat since being a vegetarian was the cornbread and salad. The salad was limp and sad. Oh well- again it was free to me so I didn't want to complain.  They have good variety of games but they seemed a tad pricey if I had to pay for it myself. We also had a dedicated bowling lane for 4 hours. Which was little impressive -maybe I'm behind on the bowling alley technology but you take a photo and they use your face in the silly animations on the screen when you get strikes etc. A long way from pencil and paper! We were able to play laser tag as a group which was a lot of fun. I never had the desire to play ever but since it was free why not?! Surprisingly! I had a great time! It's two levels so you can pick off people below. A few of my co-works said their gun didn't work or wasn't working right - this was a little frustrating for them but I had no problems the two times I played. They also have several pool tables but didn't get the chance to play.  I wasn't brave enough to do the catwalk thingy but my co-workers said it was fun and scary if you're afraid of heights like me.  I would like to go back but only when they have specials or during off hours -it seems like this place could get busy on the weekends. No thanks.  Overall it was a great night out for us.

First of all I highly recommend the curried potatoes!!This was my second time visiting this location and been to the Mesa location a few times and it's been nothing but awesome every time. We recently visited on a sleepy late Sunday night. I usually get the Greek with Quorn fake chicken type meat- I get Quorn at the grocery store so I already know it's awesome. It's not soy but better. All the yums. Trust. You will not be disappointed. Plus enough leftovers to take to work on Monday! I love the large selection of vegetarian pastys.

A $5 car wash and free vacuums are all you need sometimes. When my little car needs a good bath this is my go to spot. Similar to Clean Freak only they rinse your hood and grill plus they use a brush to clean off all those gross bugs off your windshield -nice. A damp blue rag provided for your dash or window cleaning.  The vacuums are always reliable and they also have air hoses. I never go enough to get a package but I'm sure it's worth it.

I love Burlington! I come here more than I should because they always have such great deals!  Whenever I need an outfit for an event or going on vacation this is my first stop.  They have name brand products like Calvin Klein but they mostly have good quality off brand clothing, accessories and shoes.  Their home good section is awesome and you can get a lot of stuff for your new apartment or house on the cheap.  Since we live in Arizona the coat selection is on the meager side but I've seen it ramp up since we are getting in to the "colder" months.  The best part about this place is they have a wide variety of sizes for not only women but men too!   So come get your brag bags y'all.

I came here on their 1 year anniversary and they were offering 1 free entree -what a deal!!! Otherwise I probably would never stop in here.  I got the Jasmine rice with tofu and wok glazed veggies and the pineapple sauce, topped with crispy wonton noodles.  It was pretty busy that day but they made the tofu fresh. The tofu is battered cubes with a hint of a spicy flavor.  I was pleasantly surprised how tasty it all was. I love the concept to customize your meal even the littlest ingredients and I even got the peanut sauce on the side just incase I didn't like pineapple but it was all excellent. It was enough for 2 meals which is great for the value.  I noticed the prices are on par with Pei Wei but I love Pei Wei's tofu better. -sorry. It wasn't bad, just personal preference. I need a bag of the crispy wonton noodles to snack on next time for sure.  For it being so busy the workers were friendly and happy to explain things on the menu.  I will come back for sure with my fiancé to try a different combo of flavors. He's kinda picky so with their menu I'm sure he can find something he'll like.   Thanks for the excellent free meal Foosia keep up the great flavors!

This location is smaller than other ones but it's always clean and organized. I love this place! Rarely a wait for a cashier and I'm not scared to walk to my car at night at this location compared to the one on Indian School. It's like day and night.  All the things for 99¢ 9- days a week!

Since I introduced my little niece to Boba -bubble tea we have made it our after school Friday treat. Our favorite is the green tea boba -nothing fancy. This is the closest spot from Old Town when I was searching for places. Our usual haunt is The Street in Mesa -always on point and we have also been to the boba tea place in Chandler -which was good too.  So when we walked in the place was empty with one customer already putting in her drink order. I ordered the jr. grilled cheese, the green tea milk boba, a samosa empanada -with my yelp check in I got a free 20oz fountain drink. The cashier/food heater-upper didn't know how the coupon worked and seemed frazzled while putting in my order -I had to repeat myself a few times. No big deal but I hope he got it right. A line started to form. He gave me my total $17! But things didn't seem to add up. More people walking in. So I just signed the receipt and found a seat - my first mistake. Second mistake was sitting in the full bright sun -we moved back inside -they do have a cozy little patio area. Third mistake -getting the fountain drink -iced tea tasted old but I was thirsty -should have settled with water.  We waited close to 10 minutes when the cashier/food dude came up to us asking what we were waiting for. What are we waiting for? Don't you have a list of orders and I believe everyone that ordered behind me just had drinks! We got our food a few minutes later. Fourth mistake -the empanada was small -not much flavor or filling mostly the "pastry" outer shell and barely luke warm. Fifth mistake- the grilled cheese -the regular size grilled cheese -when I asked for the junior one -this is why it was so expensive. It was covered in kettle chips which she enjoyed more than the actual sandwich. I tasted it and the cheese smelled weird and that's why she didn't like it. It was pathetic for close to $8. A Sonic drive thru grilled cheese is better than this thing. My niece enjoyed the tea I was not a fan. Too much milk not enough boba.  It's a nice place with cool design and atmosphere but when it comes to the food and drink it's a miss for me. I wanted to like it so much too.

This place has pretty good reviews and I was excited to try a new-ish place in Old Town. I thought the parking situation was going to be terrible but we got lucky finding a spot not far from the place and when we walked up there was plenty of parking in front and on the side of the building. We got seated right away and I instantly love the decor and the music. For a Sunday it wasn't packed but a good crowd was in attendance.  They have a fairly large patio and outside bar area. We sat down and about 2 minutes passed as we perused the menu that doubled as a placemat. One of the waitress walked up and asked if anyone helped us yet and explain that she wasn't our waitress and confused to where our waitress was but she would be happy to take our drink order.  We ordered drinks and chips and salsa ($2), they came out promptly while we continued to wait for our drinks. Almost halfway into our chips and salsa another waitress out of nowhere asks if we needed drinks and we gave her our order too. She walked by 3 times after asking us and never brought us anything. Finally we got our drinks 20-ish minutes. :( This place is nice but the service is not so great. Our "waitress" was nice and friendly but we never seen our original waitress.  The chips were a bad mix of yesterday's chips and today's chips. I didn't want to waste anymore money here on food.  In short I was disappointed.  Prolly not coming back.

Jimmy johns is the place to go for a quick lunch or dinner. Consistent flavor, fresh ingredients but the service was not as fast as I've had at other JJs. They might have been training a new worker so I'll give them a pass. :) I always get the #13 which is the Veggie but it's more like a cheese and avocado sammie than anything since I don't like sprouts or tomatoes. It's enough for two meals but you can get a smaller one for about a $1 less but just pay the extra $1 and make two meals out of it. I love their BBQ chips and they have the coolest reusable cups.

I love this place. It's a little far from my normal routes but I drive out of my way for it. We came for the lunch buffet twice now and have no complaints.  Plenty of options for vegetarians -salad bar, pasta w/ marinara sauce. All excellent. They have about 5 options for dessert pizza too.  The salad bar is awesome, the pizza is fresh and tastes nothing like cardboard like other buffet places. I hope this place is around for a long time!
