This is a chill place off the beaten path in Old Town, mostly regulars come here and  you can walk over to Zipps next door.

I have been going to DR G. for about 7 years and have always been satisfied with his work. He and his staff are professional and friendly.  I had a crown from over 5 years ago break and DR. G. replaced it at no charge, he definitely stands behind his work.

Though the food that we did get was great, the food we didn't get? Well we don't know. We waited over a half hour for two out of 6 dinners to arrive. We were told it would be right out and then told that the chef walked out half way through. Bill was wrong in the end and we finally just gave up and paid. The food was good but the service was poor and we feel like we were lied to repeatedly.   The worst part was eating my dinner while my guest had no food.

Really good food, they cater to people with gluten allergies, $2.50 for a soda.
