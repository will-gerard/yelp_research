I went to this place because it's by where my wife works and it's fairly inexpensive. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by the amount of little extra things they did to be sure that my car was left spic and span. At these places where they write the wash you're getting on the window, every single time they leave the mark on the window and I have to ask the person drying the car to remove it. This place they removed it without me asking...I'll definitely be back and I'll refer it to anyone in the area.

I have been here a number of times from the chili burros they sell to the fresh bacon to the rump roast for my sweet pork it's all state of the art and soo good! I especially love the snack sticks they sell. I think it's great that they just expanded the store and that they have free samples all day everyday. Go in and see the mustache of one of the owners there.

This place is fantastic! I love Thai food and I had tried a couple other Thai places that were nearer to where my wife works just for convenience but they did not even compare.  The pad Thai is perfect, the Panang is the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The flat spicy noodles are great! Everything I have ever tried here is on point. The Thai tea is the perfect complement. And the sticky rice pudding for desert rocks! I recommend this place to anyone and everyone

I am an avid sushi lover and I especially love fried calamari. That being said when I visited RA the sushi I had there was not the best. The calamari was kinda soggy, and the soy sauce was extremely bland. I will not be visiting RA anymore.

My first experience with Cornish Pasty Company was over at a friends house, she had ordered the not done ones that you bake at home...I did not have very high expectations, I was thinking something like hot pocket quality...boy was I wrong! Even baking them at home they were fantastic! I had to go and see what it was like in the actual restaurant! I have been many times.

The food here rocks, the service here rocks. The menu is very large and has many choices my wife settled on pizza and I got a burger. Top notch burger just a tad of pink like I like it super moist and seasoned perfectly. The pizza was great thin crispy crust and great toppings. The only thing that I would say and, is the reason for the 4 starts and not 5 it's pretty pricey but they have this cool app where you can download and order/pay for your food. The first time I used it I think I got $15 gift certificate. That was cool

I have always driven past here and heard of how good it is. Boy were they right. The Chicken Tika Masala was my favorite with rice and all wrapped in a piece of the unlimited supply of garlic naan. There is a type of mango drink that reminds me of naked juice more than anything else, it is fantastic. The desserts leave something to be desired, which is the only reason im not giving a 5 star. The syrup bread balls are a little soggy, but the mango pudding was my favorite of the desserts.

We go to this place often it has great food! I love the fact that they offer you the three types of dips with the chips! The Pollo Fundido is my favorite and I get it pretty much every time unless I'm feeling adventurous and I am never led astray. The only reason why this isn't a 5 start review is because when you need extra chips it's .99 but we never get it anyway...cuz they usually load you up pretty good the first time.

I have visited this office several times and have never had a bad experience. I have seen both Greg Allen and Ruth Hoskins. Dr. Allen really knows his stuff and has helped me balance all my hormones to a good level. Ruth is not afraid to spend some extra time with the patients she sees and explain things and get to know them. I really appreciate them.

We love this place! The lunch/dinner options are somewhat mediocre, but the breakfast is what it's all about. Never ending chunky cinnamon French toast for around $6 you can't get any better than that! The sauce is what really makes it though the sauce does the Macarena on my tongue. Pancakes are an option too. The berry bread pudding is my favorite dessert option.

The pies in a jar are absolutely to die for. Everything I've had here is on point. The coffee machine here is state of the art and makes the perfect cup every time. I have yet to try everything on the menu there is so much to choose from. I cannot wait to visit again to try something else.

This place is an interesting take on a steak house. It was really fun to be able to cook my own steak to perfection. The sauce they give you was great! It adds a little bit of an extra zing. The sides we got were the garlic mashed potatoes and the creamed corn both were great! The steaks were seasoned perfectly and an overall good experience on the food, the only reason it's getting a 4 star is because there were 3 other tables with people during lunch and it took about 10 minutes minutes longer than expected to get our food after we ordered. I don't know it just seemed like a long time to bring us a raw piece of meat and some sides

Seems like there was a disconnect here, something was off when we went, We got a couple different types of meat. The sauces tasted like they came from a bottle with a few unique additives. I would not try this place again, a little too pricey and not very good.

My wife and I decided to try this place out, we had been to Letha Mae's which is what it was before this and that was way good. We got in there and I ordered the Gator Bites and my wife ordered fish and chips. Man, it was good, the Rosco sauce that came with my gator bite was fantastic. My wife ordered the traditional style strips and we ended up getting a surprise cajun seasoned one to try my wife is not a huge fan of too much spice, but I loved it! Management is really, really nice and comped us one more traditional strip for my wife. Real nice place will come back and try the shrimp and wings. its a tiny bit awkward with the seating but it looks like they bought the space next door to expand into so itll be nice
