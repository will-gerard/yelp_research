This airline is definitely no-frills, as other reviewers have stated. No TV, attendants didn't smile, nickel-and-dime everything -- wot, no peanuts or pretzels or crackers? Not even one lil' bag? Are you kidding me? You have to buy their snack bag to get those. That used to be one of flying's great joys. A tiny bag of salty goodness. Not on this airline!   We've flown them before, but don't recall them EVER being this tight-assed. We've learned not to check luggage if we can at all help it because they charge $15 per bag. That's insane, but we know that's how they are, so we made do with carry-ons. Of course, that means the overhead bins fill up really fast and makes the cranky attendants even crankier. Whaddaya expect, lady, ordinarily most of this stuff would be checked! The employees seemed rather unhappy all-around.   However, the flights themselves were basically decent. On time. It's worth it to us to put up with the lack of luxury when it's a really short flight and my Amex points are covering most of it. But for a longer flight, or if we have to come out of pocket more money, we'd look for a more comfortable airline.

Our experience was wonderful with the Emergency Department, while in Vegas for a conference several years ago.  I was rushed in by EMTs after hours of vomiting (eventually blood). They asked about alcohol consumption. I don't drink, but the EMTs figured it was food poisoning. They said about half of their calls are food poisoning. It's very common on The Strip. They asked me about my dinner, I told them it was Panda Express, and they said it was probably "bad Panda". (This was in the Venetian. Will never eat there again, and to date have never eaten at any other Panda!)  They put me in a wheelchair (the hotel cooperated wonderfully) and we went to the hospital by ambulance. They started an IV en route. I freaking hate IVs but they had no choice, given the duration of vomiting and obvious dehydration. They were very careful and stayed completely unruffled. They were angels. Amazing how sweet and calm they are with such a stressful job, in the middle of the damn night!   When we arrived at Sunrise, it was odd to see nurses smoking, but it was Vegas after all.   They put me in a private room with a fantastic nurse. The doctor saw me right away, a really sweet guy with a smile and good bedside manner. They made sure I was totally comfortable with blankets (IVs can make you freaking COLD!! Brrr!) and a place for my sweetheart to sit.   As sweet as they were, I wanted to get the hell out and said so. I was a damn mess. They said I could leave as soon as I peed. Pee is their indicator that the dehydration has been solved. The staff all remained cheerful throughout.  The doctor explained that the eateries on The Strip often serve old, unfit for consumption food because they are open 24 hours. You never know what you're going to get. The sanitation is questionable and freshness often nil. Made us want to just get groceries and make our own food next time we're in Vegas.   Hours went by, and I finally peed. They let me go, and even let me take a plastic barf pan with me in case I had any more nausea. I still have it to this day, and it's pink, so it coordinates with my office. They gave me a prescription for nausea pills. The pills were great, they really helped. (Of course if you are passing contaminated food or something, that needs to come out, and the pills won't stop that.)  The missing star is for the exit wait. We had to wait quite a while for the staff at the counter to take our payment. It wasn't busy, so we didn't know what the holdup was. In my condition, it seemed like forever. That did allow some time for a cab to show up, to get back to our hotel.   I glanced at the other reviews and am so sad that so many have had terrible experiences. I guess we truly lucked out because it could have been dreadful. I don't ever look forward to getting sick but Sunrise made it a much less atrocious experience than it could have ended up.  The Venetian was incredible in letting us extend our stay for another night, even though we hadn't reserved it, because I was too frail to get on a plane when the sun came up. We changed our return flight. They were pretty booked up too, so we were very appreciative.   They also provided a wheelchair for me to get downstairs, through the lobby, and out to the cab when the time came. If you've been to the Venetian, you know that's a lot of real estate to cover. It's gigantic. One of the biggest properties in the world.   If you find yourself vomiting so hard and for so long that blood is coming out and you're too hoarse to speak, don't ignore it! Call the paramedics (the hotel did it for us) and re-hydrate. Dehydration can kill.

Gimmicky, glitzy place. No way...in Vegas?...kidding?!   But I digress.   The food sucks. Nothing special, and overpriced. Of course the decor is novel and the sounds are obnoxious and maybe scary, so it's a theme that loudly announces itself if you're into that.   Since I've been, you don't have to. Skip it.

The fountain show is spectacular at night! You don't have to be a guest here to enjoy that. You don't even have to be staying on the Strip. Just walk by and watch.   During the holidays, the fantastic floral animal displays inside are totally, absolutely awesome. Bring a camera or two and marvel at the handiwork. Someone really put all those together...too beautiful and cool. We were very impressed.   If ever in Vegas around the holidays, the Bellagio is a must-see.

I'd wanted to stay at the Venetian ever since I heard of its opening, so when we needed to go to Vegas on business and needed a place for three nights, of course we stayed here! The price was very reasonable, like $159 or something, which we didn't expect for such a grand place. We asked to be upgraded when we checked in and they put us in a 700-sq. ft suite. Luxe!   The bathroom was gigantic. Our bathrooms at home are tiny, so this was a real treat. Especially for a bath-lover like me. The tub was huge. Ok, so you get the idea...the Venetian does things big.   I'm sure you can tell from the pics how ornate and gorgeous the overall surroundings are, and that doesn't let up at any level of the hotel. They didn't miss a thing here. Wherever you are, look up, around, and there's more artistic beauty. Very classy.   One thing to be aware of is this is a MASSIVE piece of real estate. It really is its own city. So if you're going on business, try to get your room located quite close to the conference room (if your business is being conducted in the hotel itself). Otherwise, you'll possibly be doing a lot of walking and it is much more daunting in high heels. That was a regret -- that we were situated so far away from where we needed to be each day.  Also, the pools are outdoor, so we didn't get to enjoy them much because we went in the winter. The desert is frickin cold at night, and we only got to use the pools once. They are beautiful and fun.  Unfortunately, during the trip, I suddenly fell ill. I don't know if it was the flu or food poisoning, but I got completely, utterly sick with very violent vomiting (no, I don't drink, so it wasn't that!). My partner contacted the hotel who sent Security up to our room to check on me.  They said it was likely "bad Panda" because I'd eaten at Panda Express, and that at least 50% of their emergency calls are for food poisoning -- a real problem on the Strip. Oh, great! They called the paramedics, which were incredibly awesome. I got taken to Sunrise Hospital (awesome too, I'll yelp about it too) where I stayed for several hours until my dehydration was starting to reverse.   Throughout the whole ordeal, the Venetian was fantastic. We asked to extend our stay for an extra day so I could recover enough to travel home, and that wasn't a problem at all. They arranged a wheelchair for me to get around during the rest of my stay, and housekeeping sent me a huge bag of toiletries to take with me.   Every aspect of service from the hotel was wonderful. I can't say enough good about them. My sudden illness scared me to death, and they were there for us. They earned our respect in every possible way there is to respect a business. This review is my Christmas present to them, in hopes of sending them more business!

Only went for the food and lions.  Sorry, MGM, the Rainforest Cafe has sucky food and your lion exhibit is a bit sad. Not much room for those lions.  Wish the big cats had more room. They looked decently-cared for, other than that. I'm sure sometimes there are stupid people pounding on the glass to try to get their attention, but not while we were there.

Attended the U2 concert here. The stadium itself is nice, but not the best place for a concert, especially one with such a grand set-up and special effects. Bono explained that with this tour, they're going for "intimacy on a grand scale." The intimacy was definitely missing at this venue! Since that element was a conscious effort on the band's part, imagine a show where that wasn't the intention -- you'd feel even farther away from the performers.   It sorta felt like the venue was competing with, rather than supporting, the music. From the first drumbeat on, I was overwhelmed with a feeling of wanting to shut out the stadium itself and focus on the music. Could have been a lot worse -- could have been better. Was confused and bummed at the images on the 360 screen during "City of Blinding Lights" and "Unforgettable Fire" (ohmigod -- to hear that live -- never would I have dreamed!) -- could have been so beautiful, but something was wrong. It's possible that the place was too lit up for the images to be clear on the screen, or there was some sort of malfunction. I don't know.   The bathroom lines were ridiculous, but the facilities were clean. I do have one thing to say: don't block the sinks for everyone else just to primp! Witness the crowds behind you! Wash your hands and then, use your own mirror; I see one in your hands with your face powder. I know you want to look gorgeous for the guys on stage, but your pores are NOT going to be visible from where you're standing. Sheesh. I totally relate to being worked up for these performers but I also need to use the sink.  Didn't visit any concessions so can't comment on those. Overall, staff were great and concert-goers were pretty polite, but then, I wasn't on the Floor where the crazy general admission mosh was going on. Heard later that there were a lot of mean drunks. Whassup, aren't U2 fans supposed to be more humane than average? I guess people are people...  We had 17th row, on Adam's side of the stage. That meant we saw very little of Edge except what was on the screen. He took a walk once or twice down our catwalk, but it's never enough!   A great show, just o.k. venue.

Much like the other reviewer, I was shocked by the 40% tax thing, but even more, the guy down in the area where you pick up your car was a prick. Totally unfriendly, aloof, behaved like we were bothering him when asking a question (which he didn't know the answer to and made no effort to find out -- thanks dickhead!). Didn't even greet us as we approached, just barked at us to give him the number. Hmm...did someone recently graduate with tons of student debt, thinking they were gonna hit it big and now they're in...heaven forbid...a McJob? Don't take it out on us!!  For paying $200 for two days of car rental, the service could have been a lot better. The base price was fine -- only $35/day -- but the fees and taxes were worse than we'd ever seen anywhere. Maybe it's not an Advantage thing -- a Phoenix thing? never rented a car there before -- but since this was our first experience with this company, it didn't leave a good taste in our mouth.   The clerk who initially processed our rental was nicer, but not enough to justify the junk costs. Even with a AAA discount, it was exorbitant. Like we said to the cashier, "I guess they don't want people visiting Arizona!"

This is the best place to get breakfast in Vegas. Went here a bunch of times and loved everything. Everyone loved everything, and I was here in groups. I don't know that there's anything bad on the menu. You could order blindfolded and whatever you get will be good. If this existed in our area, we'd practically live here.   The only downside is it's not on the Strip, so if your reasons for being in Vegas put you on the Strip all the time, you have to go out of your way and maybe you don't have time for that. We happened to be visiting friends who live nearby and that's how we knew about it. If you're not renting a car, this is out of the way of anything you might be doing on the Strip that you could otherwise walk to.   That being said, it's delicious and inviting and groups hold their meetings here so everyone will be happy and satisfied.   So go!!

The breakfast here is on the acceptable side of average, but the service left something to be desired.   We treated our dear friend to breakfast at this restaurant of her choosing. The waitress was short with her and did not seem to care to listen to the way our guest wanted her eggs prepared. Excuse me, this place is called  the Cracked Egg. What's done with it after it's cracked is supposed to be up to the customer, hear?   It was a very tense and awkward moment. The dimwitted waitress brushed us off, and our friend had to raise her voice and repeat herself maybe three times. She also had to describe herself as the customer, lest the waitress not get it. It was appalling that it should have to be explained!  The food was mediocre but the employee's poor attitude really ruined the atmosphere.

This was my first Vegas show and the only Cirque I've seen, so I spent a lot of the time being nervous that the performers were going to fall. But they didn't. Holy moly Batman, are they in shape!   I'm a gigantic Beatles purist so I wasn't sure how I'd react to their music being reconfigured, but it was done in the best way. George Martin wouldn't let it come out any way but the best. I think Lennon would be thrilled with the musical styling, as he loved to hear his work augmented and distorted in ways that added dimension and new feeling. But I heard that even Paul loved it, so great job Sir Martin!  If you haven't thought of "Tomorrow Never Knows" in ages, this show is guaranteed to get it stuck in your head. It's the one with the sea gull-sounding distortions that you listened to repeatedly after school when you hated everyone and everything in junior high and sticking your head in between the speakers and turning the record up loud made it all go away for a while. Very inexpensive therapy for a kid! However, this show wasn't: we paid $250 each.  Recommended if you love the Beatles, or want to.

It was wonderful to find this place during our trip to AZ, as all of the Johnny Rockets in our area have disappeared. It was an oasis in the desert!  My egg salad sandwich (my routine JR staple) was very good except it had a bit too much mayo. If I were to return, I'd ask for light mayo. Other than that, perfect! The fries were pretty good. The salad was wonderful. We also got nice to-go containers that held up well for traveling. That was a nice touch -- when you're driving around, trying to figure out where your hotel is and the developed area is too new to appear on maps yet, it's good to know your leftovers are not spilling out in the rental car.   The highlight was the sweet, awesome service from our sweet, awesome, super-hot waitress. She was so breathtaking that I could barely speak my order. Ah well, there are worse problems to have!

The staff are really nice here, the service is prompt, and the booths are roomy and clean, but I wouldn't especially want to come back. While the menu is gargantuan, there was very little that sounded appealing. It took me a long time to figure out what to order because everything sounded so oily. Not what I want, only a few hours after getting off a plane. However, it was highly recommended by a hotel employee, so I thought it'd be worth a try.  Finally I decided on the margherita pizza. It was terribly salty and not much else. However, the creme brulee was really good. Good thing it was shared with two other people because it was very rich!   Can't vouch for the alcohol offerings, but as far as food goes, it was overpriced and trying too hard to be fancy/trendy. So glad our friend's expense account was covering it because I couldn't feel good about throwing that kind of money at mediocre food.   The big smiles beaming from the workers were big perks, though. Seemed that they all really liked their jobs and the customers!

Bought our new ventilation fan here. They carry Panasonic, which is reputedly the best. The prices here are far lower than anywhere else, the shipping's free on orders over $79, customer service is terrific, and the selection's gigantic. What else could you ask for?   They have lots of plumbing supplies that are not found in box stores and you don't need to be a licensed contractor to buy.  If you're not sure what to buy, they can help. I ordered on Tuesday; the shipment was here on Friday, in time for my electrician to install it. (He couldn't believe the price I got!) Will definitely order from them again!
