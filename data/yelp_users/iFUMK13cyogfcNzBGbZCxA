A friend and I went into this Fed Ex Office to have them blow up the timpani part for Beethoven's 7th Symphony.  The manager said that they cannot copy music because it is protected under copyright law.  We tried to explain that the 7th Symphony was written in 1811 and is Public Domain but he insisted that "somebody owns the copyright on it."  Unfortunately, that manager does not understand how copyright law works.  We even showed him that the music was available on the International Music Score Library Project (www.imslp.org) which only has works that are in the public domain and he said that he cannot trust something just because some website says it's true.  I wish that manager could understand that everything that exists on a piece of paper is protected under copyright law so, when a college student throws their text book on top of your copier, that's protected under copyright law, when someone brings in a picture and copies it, that's protected under copyright law - however, copyrights do have limits and do not last forever.  Works do become public domain after a certain amount of time and orchestra pieces written in the 1800s are in the public domain now.  The manager did suggest a "loop hole".  He said that if we submitted the print job online and clicked the "I understand I can't print anything protected under copyright" box that they would then be able to print our music for us because, for some reason, us clicking a box relieves them of their duties to protect the assets of those who hold the copyrights.  Unfortunately, we will not be returning to this Fed Ex Office for any or our printing needs due to this managers refusal to understand how copyrights work.

My family loves Liberty Market.  I really appreciate the decor of the restaurant; it's sort of a 50s style vintage that I would almost describe as "garage" but don't let that dissuade you from going.  My absolute favorite dish they serve is the Picnic Sandwich.  It has roasted turkey, caramelized pecans, green apple, blue cheese, greens, and roasted red pepper aioli.  Everything about it is perfect, but when you get your first bite of blue cheese and caramelized pecans you'll wonder why you don't eat that sandwich every single day of your life.  Another favorite is the Flatiron Steak with Mr. Pibb marinade.  I'm a fan of flatiron steak and anything that uses Mr. Pibb in it is good in my book.  The line to order can get pretty long at the standard meal times, especially on the weekends, but the employees do a really good job of getting you a number and assigning you a table while you're waiting.  I've never finished ordering and not had a place to go and sit down right away - no matter how busy it's been.  There is no waiter service at Liberty Market; you start by ordering your food at the register and then get your own drinks.  The food is delivered to you table by runners which is nice, but then drink refills are on your own throughout.  It's a good system that works well though.  The runners delivering the food to the table is a nice in between so you don't need to go back up to the counter after you've sat down.  Dessert is great too - we always get the Salt River Bar because chocolate and salt is a perfect combination.  They have lots of house made desserts and bakery items like red velvet cake, cinnamon rolls, scones, rice crispy treats, and cupcakes.  Definitely pick something up for dessert.  I've only mentioned lunch and dinner in this review, but Liberty Market does do breakfast which is what we go in for most often.  I don't love their breakfast selections however.  You pretty much only have a choice of variations on eggs.  The breakfast menu is not extensive or particularly interesting, but, like I said, my family and I probably go to Liberty Market for breakfast more than we do for lunch or dinner so take that for what it's worth.  Liberty Market is one of our absolute favorite restaurants in the downtown Gilbert area.  We are so lucky to have such a unique place so close by and in an area that we love visiting.

This Safeway is THE WORST. The lines are always super long, the staffing is minimal and not enough to cover the customers shopping, and the employees are rude/inappropriate. While checking out once, the checker and the bagger we're having a political argument and the checker turned to me and asked, "Do you like Obama?" That is not an appropriate question.  The only time I ever shop here is when it is more convenient and I regret my decision every time.  Plus, my son is always disappointed that they don't have any fire truck shopping carts, but I'll let him write about that in his own review... whenever he learns to talk and write.

My parents recommended this restaurant as one they liked.  My wife and I did not enjoy the food or the experience.  The food was just bland and not unique.  I had the Penne Caprese which had penne pasta tossed with grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, tomato, red onions, fresh garlic and basil, drizzled with balsamic glaze.  Sounds good to me!  It wasn't a bad dish, it just wasn't a good dish.  The two chicken breasts were grilled and flavorless, the balsamic glaze was meh and the mozzarella was probably from a grocery store.  While I probably would have been okay with the normalness of Vito's dishes, the service was lacking as well and those two things combined make me pretty unhappy.  My iced tea was refilled once during service and the ice had completely melted.  I HATE iced tea without ice.  We were sitting on the patio and the server seemed like she probably had tables inside as well and that restaurant is huge on the inside.  Also, the side table on the patio with the refill pitchers and Micros terminal looked like a folding table with a dirty cloth draped over it and lots of stuff stored underneath.  It just wasn't very nice looking and seem like it should be something that was behind the scenes instead of on the patio.  IF I went back to Vito's (which is a big if) I don't think I would sit on the patio again because it's my least favorite type of patio setting.  The patio is basically in the parking lot and has a lot of cars that drive past it.  I really don't need exhaust with my bland chicken; it doesn't make it better.  I think Vito's has it's core demographic and is successful because of their return business, I'm just not that demographic and will probably go to Olive Garden the next time I'm looking for Italian.  Sorry Vito's; I just wasn't impressed... but I wanted to like you.

My wife and friends and I love Shuseki!  Whenever we would have friends come visit us in Las Vegas, we would always head out to Shuseki for late night dinner.  It was usually what our friends were looking forward to doing when they came out.  The menu is written in Japanese so it's a good thing they have pictures for every item.  We always ended up getting the same things every time so we got used to order them.  Definitely order the potato croquettes, they are one of my favorites, and just be adventurous.  The items on the menu are usually pretty cheap so we would order a ton of food family style for the table and just have the server start bringing it out as it was ready.  The service is probably the worst part of Shuseki.  It's really hard to get your drink refilled and the servers are usually running around so much that it's hard to get their attention for anything.  If you really need something, you have to really have to flag somebody down.  That said though, I love Shuseki and will continue going there whenever I head back to Las Vegas to visit.

The Chandler Symphony Orchestra is a wonderful way to spend the evening!  All of their concerts are free, which is great, and they perform at the Chandler Center for the Arts so it's a great venue too.  I've been attending their concerts since I moved back to the Valley about three years ago and they are just wonderful.  The musicians are excellent and the concerts are very well planned out.  A great option when attending a Chandler Symphony Orchestra concert is to get lunch or dinner (depending on when the concert is) in Downtown Chandler first then walk over to the Chandler Center for the Arts for the performance.  Their pops concert is always fun with special guest artists and exciting, fast-paced music that everyone knows and loves.  If you are looking for a wonderful and special evening activity, I highly recommend the Chandler Symphony Orchestra!

Great food, good prices, nice staff.  This is one of our favorite lunch places.  We love going to Dragon Wok for lunch after church on Sunday's.  The restaurant can get pretty busy at dinner time, but during lunch, we are always able to get seated right away.  The hostess recognizes us as soon as we walk in the door and always asks us where our son is if we don't bring him with us.  It's the best feeling to be remembered!  The lunch menu is really well priced (about $7 - $9 per entree) and each entree comes with fried rice, an egg roll and crab puffs.  It's the perfect amount of food for me.  The staff is pretty good about keeping drinks full; I fell like this wasn't always the case, but in recent visits it has been perfect.  There is no dessert menu at Dragon Wok (maybe we'll get one someday), but fortune cookies are always delivered with the check.

My wife and I moved to the South East Gilbert area about six months ago and it's been nice having this Costco so close to our house.  I stopped by the other day to pick up a few things for the week and the man at the door checking cards was very nice and pleasant.  When I showed him my card on my way in he said, "Good morning, sir.  How are you today?  Thank you for the card."  It was nice to have someone who is polite standing at the door instead of the usual employee who doesn't talk but just nods as you enter.  I got all of my stuff, checked out pretty quickly (it was 10am on a weekday so the lines weren't long, but this Costco is like all of the others - it should be avoided on Saturdays and Sundays if you don't have time to wait), and when I left, the same man who greeted me checked my receipt.  Again, he was pleasant and happy.  I thanked him and went on my way.  This Costco is just like every other Costco, but, so far, I haven't had any troubles here.

We will not be going back to Healing Hearts Pediatrics.  I have been taking my son to Healing Hearts since we moved to Arizona about a year and a half ago.  The Wellness Check visits have all been fine, scheduled months in advance, but whenever he's sick, we can't get him in.  One time, he was running a fever and throwing up and we called for a same day appointment.  We were told that they didn't have any appointments for another few days but that if his temperature went over 103 we should take him to the ER.  That night, at about 3am, his temperature went to 104 so we took him to the hospital.  Our final bill from the ER was just over $2,000.00 for some Tylenol suppositories.  If Healing Hearts had seen him that day, we wouldn't have had that bill or the trip to the ER at 3am.  Today, he was running a fever and I thought, "I won't even call to ask, I'll just show up."  I got my son to their Gilbert office at 8am (right when they open) and told them we didn't have an appointment.  The receptionist said, "Oh, we don't take walk ins."  She did offer me a 9:30am appointment but by that time I was done and did not take the appointment that would make me sit in the waiting room with a sick two-year old for another hour and a half.  I asked if the office manager was available and I was told that she worked at the Chandler office.  So, I drove to the Chandler office.  When I went up to the counter the receptionist asked if I had an appointment.  I said no, but that I was looking for Mary Ann.  The receptionist asked, "Were you just at the Gilbert office?"  I said that I was and she told me Mary Ann would be out in just a moment.  Mary Ann came out to the lobby quickly and listened to my frustration.  After I explained our $2,000.00 Tylenol from the last time and that I was unhappy they did not offer same day sick appointments she said, "The other office did offer you a 9:30am appointment.  We're very busy this time of year so a 9:30am appointment is pretty amazing to find for today."  Basically, I should feel lucky they were willing to squeeze me in.  I told her that the Urgent Care was more his primary doctor at this point than his primary doctor was because whenever he's sick I can't seem to get him in, but when he's well, we have no problems.  She explained to me that wellness appointments are usually made months in advance so that why they are easier to get.  Isn't that the whole point Mary Ann?  In order to see a doctor at Healing Hearts, you need to schedule your appointment months in advance and you should feel lucky that they are willing to see you.  Do not use this doctor's office; when you really need them, they will not care about you and will not see you.  I'm going to find a pediatrician who actually cares about the health of my son and not just the number of dollar signs they can make appointments for in a day.

My family has always liked NYPD Pizza and this location in Gilbert near the San Tan mall is a good spot.  The restaurant itself gets VERY busy on the weekends so we tend to call our order in an pick it up instead of waiting in line for a table, but during the week it's easy enough to get a seat quickly.  The service in the restaurant when we do dine in has always been fine, never over the top amazing, but good enough.  It's exactly what I would expect from this type of restaurant.  We usually start by ordering the cheesy garlic knots (whether we're dining in or picking up) because they are amazing.  My 18 month old son also loves them (he loves anything that is made of bread) and it's a nice way to keep him occupied while we wait for our pizza to come out.  Pizzas generally take 15 to 20 minutes to come out which is what I would expect and they always taste good.  I really like the sliced sausage they have available instead of the crumbled sausage.  Sliced sausage is flat and more similar in size to pepperoni... only, a little bit longer and not quite as round.  My wife's grand mother always orders the spaghetti and meatballs which she loves and ends up taking the left overs home for lunch the next day.  Overall, NYPD Pizza is a nice place to go if you're looking for a family friendly atmosphere with a very understandable and approachable menu.

My wife and I have been to Bourbon Steak twice now and both times have been incredible.  The food is unique and creative and the service is impeccable.    We have made sure to order different appetizers each time we've gone in order to experience a wide range from the menu.  Everything we have ordered has been amazing but, this last time, there was a definite standout.  The Local Goose Egg:  Our server explained that the chef is friends with a local farmer who sells his goose eggs to Bourbon Steak.  The egg is whipped with cream fresh and served with black trumpet mushrooms, English peas, and buttered country bread.  The egg isn't quite scrambled (like I said, it's whipped) but it isn't runny.  It's just soft and fluffy and, I would venture to say, only a little more viscous than a soup.  We have each ordered the New York Strip both times that we've gone and it has been perfect both times.  It's cooked just right and nice and salty with every bite.  I considered order the Prime Lamb Tasting this past visit, but couldn't pull myself away from the New York Strip.  They do offer the standard USDA cuts as well as two Wagyu selections from Snake River Farms in Colorado and one Australian Wagyu at Market Price.  Two of those have the very high price tag you would expect, but they 10 oz. Flat Iron Wagyu steak is priced at $49 which is just a few dollars over the New York Strip and seems very reasonable.  For dessert, we  ordered the Bourbon Bar which has dark chocolate, peanut butter, and pretzels (can't go wrong with that combination), and the Beignets.  The beignets need a special note because the menu offers the choice of "Tongan Vanilla Crème Brulèe, Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, or Valrhona Dark Chocolate Pot de Crème."  If you were going to make a decision between those three, I would suggest the Macallan 18 Year Butterscotch Pudding, but you can actually have all three of them brought out as a trio.  This would be my recommendation.  Why limit yourself to one dessert when you can have three?  Bourbon Steak has been the highest quality restaurant I've been to since moving back to Arizona from Las Vegas a year ago; they are definitely on par with the highly rated restaurants on the Strip.  Which, since moving back, I have found it difficult to discover quality and service that match what I became accustomed to as "normal", but Bourbon Steak does.

When Lance owned Create it was super amazing. Ever since it was sold, it has gone down hill fast.  My wife and I used to go to Create every Wednesday night, but now, we have stopped going at all. Our orders come out wrong every time without fail and the staff has lost their energy and drive.  One time, there was a young child (probably 10 or 12 years old) at the register when I walked up. The adult behind the counter looked at them and said, "you can do it." The child proceeded to take my order... for 10 minutes while she searched for the buttons on the screen and tried to understand my request for "roasted red pepper Italian vinaigrette" on the side.  I ended up with red peppers on my burger and The Sauce on the side... not what I asked for.  Meanwhile, the adult behind the counter did nothing to assist; this experience was the last straw for me.  Also, when Lance was there he always had three custards: vanilla, chocolate, and a flavor of the day.  Create still acts like they have a flavor of the day, but in reality, it's a "combination" if the day using vanilla or chocolate custard. There is no additional "flavor" like orange, banana, or peanut butter.  And, when I ask the staff what is in one of the combinations, they honestly have no idea and aren't willing to find out.  Create used to be an amazing place, but it is just not anymore.

We had such a good time at the Riparian Preserve with our son.  The preserve is much larger than I had expected it to be and the endless trails through the brush were a lot of fun to explore.  There is a fishing lake that was very popular and plenty of wildlife to find.  Even though the Preserve is just a "walk around and look at nature stuff" we spent about three hours there with my two-year old just enjoying everything, wandering down paths, and splashing our hands in the stream.  Right at the front of the park there is also a small play area for kids and plenty of picnic space with views of the lake.  We haven't done it yet, but there is an observatory just inside the park that indicates it is open to the public on Friday and Saturday nights - no reservations are required.  I guess you just show up and they'll let you use their big telescope.  I'll need to go check that out.  I had been intending to go to the Preserve for a long time now and I'm glad we finally did.  It is definitely a place we will go back to while the weather is good.

Cornish Pasty is great for lunch with friends.  They have a couple of locations locally here in the Phoenix area and are quickly expanding elsewhere too. (I've heard they are opening a location in Las Vegas).  For those who don't know what Pastys are, they are pastries filled with meats and other ingredients and baked.  Sort of like a calzone, but not pizza related.  I usually end up getting the Italian pasty - it's filled with pepperoni, salami, capocollo, ham, fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and roasted tomatoes and served with a side of marinara.  They have plenty of other options too like The Porky, Shepperd's Pie, Cajun Chicken, Lovely Bit of Salmon, and The Pilgrim to name a few.  Making changes or substitutions to the pastys won't really pay off for you because the pastys are pre-made that day and, if you need anything removed or added to yours, they will need to make a brand new one and it takes a lot longer to get it baked and out to you.  They will gladly make the substitutions, just be ready to wait for it.  Traditionally, the Cornish Pasty locations have had super small dining rooms, but this location just expanded into the space next door and it's really opened up a lot of additional seating.  We have stopped going to Cornish Pasty with our son because of the amount of time it takes to get the food delivered to the table.  This is not the fault of the restaurant, (the service is usually really good) the pastys just have to bake for awhile and our 18 month old son gets antsy and is done with sitting in the highchair before the food arrives.  It hasn't stopped us from going to Cornish Pasty, we just don't go with him anymore.

I went to Relish with my family and a few friends (party was 4 adults and 1 20 month old).  When we entered the restaurant the manager asked if we would be joining them for dinner.  I said, "Yes, we have a reservation under Scott at 6:30."  Without looking at the reservations screen, the manager said, "Of course Mr. Pate, we have a table all ready for you on the patio."  I was impressed that my arrival had been anticipated.  We were seated at a large round table on the patio with a highchair, kid's activity book, and crayons all set up and ready.  Our server stopped by a few minutes later and took our drink and appetizer orders.  My wife was having trouble finding the kid's menu and the server directed her to it in the back of the kid's activity book.  You can also order anything from the kid's menus at any of the other restaurants on the property if there is nothing on the Relish kid's menu that you like, but they did warn us it would take a little longer since it would need to be delivered across the property.  We put in a cheese burger kid's order right away as well.  The appetizers came out quickly.  We ordered the BBQ Chicken Nachos and the Cornbread Skillet for the table.  They were both great.  We actually ended up ordering a second Cornbread Skillet because it was so good.  Service throughout the evening was perfect and friendly.  They have lots of great local beers on their menu which our friend enjoyed a Peach Beer from Four Peeks (she said it tasted more like a cocktail than a beer though - it's pretty sweet).  My 20 month old son got 2 kid sized cheese burgers and a basket of tater tots that kept him busy throughout the meal.  He ended up eating the cheese burgers "top-down" starting with the bun and working his way toward the middle, but he loved every bite.  For our entrees, three of us had burgers (the Cowboy Burger is their most popular and two of us had that, I had the blue cheese burger because I can't pass up blue cheese).  The burgers were good, but I would say that they were the least impressive part of our meal over all.  Each one comes with a basket of tater tots, but you can sub the tots out for a variety of other sides for an additional cost of $3.50.  The fourth adult in our party ordered a Wilcox Apple Salad and the Chili Verde from the appetizer menu.  Honestly, that seemed like the best way to go.  If you are going for dinner, I would recommend one of their entrees or a salad/appatizer combo over a burger.  Not that the burgers are bad, just that there is so much more interesting on the menu.  For dessert, we ordered their s'mores dessert.  It comes out with a large ceramic pot with burning coals inside and a selection of graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate around the edge of the plate.  You take the marshmallows, put them on the skewers that are provided, and roast them right at the table.  It was a really fun dessert.  Overall, the service was excellent and the food was great.  We like Relish and will definitely be back.

The Gilbert Farmer's Market has been great!  The market is right in Downtown Gilbert which makes it a great place to go to after breakfast and Liberty Market.  We've always had a great experience with the vendors and really like visiting One Windmill Farms while we are there (they seem to have the largest selection of fresh veggies available).  The market is outdoors which can get pretty hot in the summertime (but is absolutely perfect any other time of the year) but since it is in a parking lot with covered parking, all of the vendors are in the shade and you don't need to stand in the sun the whole time.  Lots of vendors are available there and (thankfully) very few are art vendors - most are selling food (which is why I go in the first place).  There are groups selling bread, ready to boil pasta, jellies and jams (my favorite is the pineapple jalapeno), plenty of fresh vegetables, fish, and beef.  There are usually one or two food truck in the area and some live music.  I would really like to see more food trucks in the future, but I love a good food truck gathering.  Most of the vendors take credit cards through their square readers on their phones which is convenient.

Frost is a great gelato shop that has a lot of unique and interesting flavors.  Sometimes, it's hard to pick just one or two, but I usually make up my mind pretty quickly.  Their best selling flavor is Seasalt Caramel and I have to admit it is one of my go-to flavors when I'm having a tough time deciding.  One of my personal favorites is their Dark Chocolate.  It's pretty thick and is almost like eating a cold brownie, but I think it's delicious and get it almost every time we go.  One of my only complaints about Frost is, as soon as you go through the line and get up to the counter, the employees ask what they can get for you right away without giving you a chance to look in the case to see what flavors they have.  I know that theer is a menu on the wall, but they do have seasonal flavors that are not listed on the menu and I usually need a few moments to browse the case to see what strikes me that day.  The other thing about their menu is that it is not always accurate.  As I write this review, I am looking at their menu online and see that they have Butter Pecan listed as a flavor but on one visit when I tried to order Butter Pecan they told me it was a seasonal flavor and they did not have it available.  This can be concerning since I cannot trust that the flavors on the menu are the flavors in the case.  They only have four indoor tables and during the busy times this are usually packed but there are a few tables outside and while it's not 117 degrees out, they are a nice place to sit.  Frost also has some great no-sugar added flavors which is nice.  I usually end up going to Frost with my wife and 18 month old so (who loves bananas) so its nice to be able to get him a no-sugar added banana gelato and not feel like I'm filling him up with terrible things that he shouldn't be eating.  Overall, Frost is a great place and we love going there.  When you go, tell the staff that you need a minute to look at the falvors they have and they will give you the time you need.  Frost is also open later than most of the other stores in the San Tan mall (10pm during the week and 11pm on the weekends), so it's nice to have a late-night place to hit before the day is done.

I've been hearing about Crepe Bar from my wife and we finally made the time to meet a friend there for lunch.  It's nice that they have a few tables indoors as well as outdoors (although, during the Summer months they probably won't get used much).  We approached the counter and the girl who helped us was very nice and made suggestions to help us decide on what to order.  We each ordered a savory crepe and a sweet crepe.  All of the crepes were really good; my lemon dessert crepe was especially satisfying.  My savory crepe was delicious too - it was a chicken crepe and the edge of it had crispy cheese all around which was a nice touch.  The crepes themselves are perfect.  My one complaint about Crepe Bar is the drink selection.  They have an espresso bar, but, beyond that, your choices are craft root beer (which I have no problem with) or water from a jug on the counter.  There is no soda fountain and no bottled water.  I understand if you don't want to pay licensing to have a soda fountain or, maybe you just don't want soda, that's fine too, but having bottled water in Arizona is a pretty standard option.  The luke warm, non-iced jug on the counter is just not what we were looking for.  Crepe bar was definitely a nice place and I will go back there for sure (my wife has already been back so I'm a little jealous).  But, when we go back, we will take our own bottles of water with us... and we'll buy a root beer too.

I have been to this Urgent Care a few times since we moved to Gilbert and I really like it.  The lobby is bright and clean and set up well with chairs and a television to keep my son entertained while I'm filling out paperwork.  The only concern that I have experienced is, the reception desk staff has never been warm or inviting.  It seems like all business for them and I almost feel like I'm bothering them.  It's not that they've ever been mean, they're just not friendly.  Beyond that, I have always been taken back to the examination rooms quickly.  The rooms are good sized and well maintained.  The nurses and doctors have always been friendly and attentive.  I have gone in once for myself and once for my 18 month old son and both experiences were great.  I will continue coming to the Urgent Care!

I do not like to drink coffee or (most) coffee related drinks, but Coffee Rush has some great alternatives!  My wife, my best friend, and I like to write comic book and movie scripts together and we usually do this late at night at Coffee Rush.  They serve coffee until 11pm (which is great because it gives us a chance to get there and spend some time) and they stay open until 12am so you don't have to leave right at 11pm.  I usually get a 20oz. Black & White Frost (something my wife introduced me to) and I always look forward to it.  It is one of their blended drinks with ice, milk, white chocolate, coffee.  It's pretty perfect.  Depending on my mood, I'll get whipped cream on top or not - depends on the day.  My best friend gets their hot chocolate (which I have also had on cold evenings) and it is well made.  I always prefer a little more chocolate than most places put into their hot chocolate, but when I've asked for a little extra chocolate they have always accommodated me without delay.  They also have a few extra non-coffee drinks like Deadly Soda and assorted Italian sodas.  You can access their free wi-fi with the purchase of a drink.  Since we purchase three drinks (my wife, my best friend, and myself) we are always able to get three wi-fi passes.  The passes are good for three hours of access to their Internet and, if you're there for more than three hours, you should probably buy another drink to get another pass and stop being cheap.  We never sit outside on the patio because it seems like everyone out there smokes and I can stand smoke.  It would be really nice to be able to sit out there some evenings, but I never can because of the smoking.  Inside is nice enough though (every locations is pretty much the same on the inside) and the smoke from the patio doesn't bother me inside.  I always get my Coffee Rush card stamped when I go in and it adds up pretty quickly for a free drink.  They are always good about taking care of you when you get to your free drink and never give you any trouble about it.  They seem genuinely pleased that you've come back so many times.  Mondays are "double punch" nights so stop in for 2-for-1 punches!

My wife, her sister, and I went to Ryu late one Tuesday night for late night dinner/snacking.  The employees were super nice and seated us right away.  I think there was a party of two at one of the Teppanyaki tables and maybe two or three people at the sushi bar and beyond that, the restaurant was empty... but, like I said, it was late.  We ordered our beverages and soups.  The soups were savory and delicious.  I ordered gyoza and my wife and her sister each ordered soba with chicken.  The soba dishes were overly sweet and not at all what we were expecting, but they were still good.    The gyoza was perfect and exactly what I had expected.  They had mochi on the menu (which I am a huge mochi fan) and tempura fried ice cream.  We were excited and ordered one of each.  The server came back and said that they only had green tea mochi (which I do not like) so I canceled my mochi order.  Then the server came back and said they were out of tempura ice cream as well.  We were disappointed, but, again, it was very late so we understood.  The server was very apologetic about it and everything was fine.  We paid our bill and, as we were leaving, the manager (possibly owner) opened the door for us and apologized again for not having the desserts available.  We will definitely go back to Ryu and, even though there were a few issues, we know how restaurants work and completely understood - we weren't upset with our experience at all.

I'm not usually a Starbucks person but my wife wanted to stop for early morning hot chocolates and this Starbucks is right next to my house.  The parking lot is probably the worst part about this location.  It's a tiny one-lane strip and the drive through line goes right through it.  If you park in their parking lot you will get blocked in by the drive through line and there is no telling when someone will be nice enough to give you the space you need to back out.  But, once you have backed out, you'll still have to sit in the drive through line until you are able to turn right.  Honestly, if you park in their parking lot you will be stuck trying to get out for about 30-45 additional minutes.  We parked further out in the parking lot closer to Kneaders... which I'm sure Kneaders loves.  Inside, the restaurant is small with very little seating.  The girl who took our order had to check to see if they had each thing that we ordered and she wasn't very happy about it.  She sort of mumbled our order back to us, charged my card, and we were done.  No one at this location is particularly pleasant to speak with.  Our hot chocolates came out pretty quickly; we only had to wait for a few minutes.  After drinking our hot chocolates though, I'm not sure why I would pay someone to make that for me.  I make better hot chocolate at home.  The drink was pretty disappointing.  Overall, I don't see any reason to come to this location as it is difficult to get into, difficult to get out of, the service is not very friendly, and the drinks are not very good.  Now, as I mentioned, I don't usually go to Starbucks, but my sister-in-law is a Starbucks addict and she hates going to this location too.  She will drive further to go to a different Starbucks just to avoid going to this one even though this location is just around the corner from our house.

Waffle Crush is super great!  They park at a school near my house about once a week and my two year old (who doesn't say many words yet) learned the word "waffle" after his first visit.  The waffles are uncomplicated and hot.  Little chunks of sugar are found crystallized throughout the waffle which is amazing and they have so many different combinations to choose from for toppings.  I usually go with the standard banana and Nutella toppings, but they have a Biscoff topping that you have to try before turning your nose up at it.  You probably don't even know what Biscoff is so why not try it?  Biscoff are cookies that are ground up into a spread - it's cookie spread!  It's amazing; try it.  On New Year's Eve, my wife found out that Waffle Crush was open until 1am and we drove 30 minutes out of our way just to stop by and get some waffles.  They are that good.  They do take credit cards which is great; they have an iPad with a card reader so as you order, they will punch your order into the iPad, it gets sent automatically to the chefs in the truck, and they run your card.  It's super easy and convenient.  I would recommend ordering your waffle in a to-go container.  It's a little bit easier to manage and if you don't finish the whole waffle (they're pretty small anyway) you can close it up and take it home with you.
