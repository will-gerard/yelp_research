By far, one of my most favorite places in Arizona. And I'm a second generation native, I know a lot about this state and a lot about the hidden treasures. This is one of them.  I've been meaning to write a review for sometime as its been quite awhile since we stayed here.  My husband and I got married on April 11, 2009. It was the night before Easter and we had a room booked here. It was not only a holiday weekend but a popular wedding day, so we were competing with a lot of other couples.  We showed up somewhere between 11:30-midnight to check in. Checking in before us was also another bride and groom who apparently got the last regular room. When we got to the front desk we were told they had overbooked. We were crushed as we really wanted to stay here and didn't know what our options were going to be., especially it being so late into the night. Without hesitation we were upgraded to the honeymoon suite, and on them! The staff was so nice, and prompt. It took us less than 10 minutes to check in, even with an upgrade.   Everyone was so nice. The service was great. The room was huge, beautiful and we had 2 private patios. I wish we were able to stay for more than one night to really appreciate all the amenities. There was a large shower, a separate tub, a living room with lots of seating, and a bedroom with a large king bed. The linens were amazing and so soft. It was just the best experience!   We ordered room service the next morning before check-out. The food was amazing, it came quickly, and again, the staff was amazing.   I have no complaints about this place other than I wish we could have stayed a week instead of a night. Highly recommend!

I would give this Target negative stars if I could.   First, it's disgusting. I've come in a few times over the last few months (because it's close to my in laws house) and it's always the same. Today, my 5 year old commented on how dirty it is. MY FIVE YEAR OLD SON, who plays in the dirt daily, who doesn't always shower, and sweats like a mother, commented how icky this place was. T  Do they never clean the bathrooms or wipe down the tables? It's honestly barf inducing.  The employees are rude. I'm 35 weeks pregnant so yes, I move a little slower while walking through the aisles. Getting on my ass and sighing loudly and repeatedly isn't going to make me go faster.   I love Target. So much so that it's usually a family outting of sorts. My husband and I get Starbucks, my son gets pizza, everyone wins. If it was legal to burn this place to the ground, I would do that too. The clientele is...interesting. The parking is terrible and very busy.  Look out or you will get run over. The pizza my son got today was blue on top. Blue! The breadsticks I got had no seasoning. The coke was flat.     Today was such a bad experience, I had a complete crying meltdown while waiting for my husband to come rescue us. I honestly do not understand the good reviews for this place. Never again.

10 years ago, this was the first place we came to because it was close and looked nice.  10 years later, we are still patients, and I would never go anywhere else.   Dr Elliot is fantastic. She's done 3 surgeries in the last year and a half for our geriatric dog who has skin cancer, and I know she has his best interest at heart. She knows our animals, and is very gentle with them.   Her staff is friendly, we are usually able to get in fairly soon,  its not a long wait, and the office is clean!   Without going into too much detail, there are two specific incidents I want to mention. One, is when we had our dog Madison. She was NOT dog friendly. So when she needed her nails clipped, I told the girls ahead of time and they made sure we came in at a time when no one else would be in the waiting room. They even cleared out all the other patients in the back as to keep Madison calm during her clipping. It was amazing and I felt so comfortable bringing her there when we otherwise hardly felt comfortable with her anywhere else. Loved people. Hated other dogs.  Another incident is when our other dog (Madison's former housemate until they started fighting and before she went to live with my parents) was when our dog Boston got out of our yard. We were ticketed for a loose dog and had to quarantine him for 10 days. Dr Elliot's office was the first place we called in a panic because we didn't want to send our dog to live in a county shelter for 10 days. They immediately cleared a place for him. I know he was well cared for there. And it wasn't as expensive as we originally thought either.   I just love this office and as long as we are pet owners, we will never go anywhere else.

I am so torn with this place as another poster has said. The wait time are great, the front desk staff is wonderful, most of the time the nurses are good, which is the reason for the 2 stars. Last night was a different story.   The nurse was literally asking me questions as I was attempting to finish his previous one. He was walking out the door as I was still talking. I couldn't believe it. And they weren't busy, like at all. We got in and into a room in less than 10 minutes. We've been a few times and the last two times have been seen by Dr Young. He is awful. My 4 year old has been coughing violently for a week (something we've been dealing with on and off for months). I explained to him that we saw the pediatrician yesterday morning, but that things had gotten worse since coming home. Hence why we are here! He cut me off in the middle of my sentences, made me feel about as stupid as I possibly could, and wouldn't listen to me when I told him everything he currently suggested WAS NOT WORKING. When I asked about a cough syrup for my son (he is coughing to the point of making himself throw up, which I stated) he laughed. He laughed at me, then proceeded to tell me that doctors don't do that sort of thing anymore. I was practically begging for something to make my son comfortable, and he wouldn't listen.   He ordered an x-ray, which let us know my son had some chest inflammation going on. No kidding! He's violently coughing and complaining his chest hurts. Groundbreaking! He gave my son a teeny, tiny shot of a liquid steroid last night in the room, and they failed to put what he was given or how much on his discharge papers. Currently waiting until they open so I can call and confirm what he was given. We were sent home with an inhaler with the same medication he's been using at home, after I explained that its not working.   IDK if I will come back to this location. Dr. Young is truly a piece of work, and I can't understand why he is a children's doctor of all things. If you can come and request a different doctor, your experience should be better.

If I could give this negative 10 stars, I would. Do not ever ever ever come here. You'll be in the drive thru for 30 minutes.

Cheesecake Factory is my go-to when I've a rough day or just don't feel like cooking. The portions are huge, and the service is *usually* decent.  We went last night (Tuesday) after a rough day, neither my husband or I felt like cooking. Figuring this was our best option since it would have something for everyone, we went late hoping we'd miss any crowds. But its a Tuesday night in late May, why on earth where there be a wait?  Sure enough, we got there and it was a 5 minute wait. No big deal, even though we waited more like 10-15 minutes...and that is no fun with a hungry 4 year old, when its after 8pm. Probably our mistake as parents thinking we would get a quick meal, and be in and out.   We were seated and it took another 10 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. Our waiter did apologize for the wait but it was a very half-assed apology. Either be sincere or don't bother mentioning it. We also ordered our food since we had time to look over the menu. Drinks were slow getting out, another 10 minutes. Food was also slow getting out. We were probably here 40 minutes before we got our food. It was busy, but not that busy.   Our waiter was nice but did not ask me once if I needed a refill on my drink, my glass was clearly empty. He did offer my husband another beer though and promptly brought that out.   The service here just sucked, and its gotten worse every time we've come. I know losing us as customers won't make or break you, but we really are done with this location. If you must go to Cheesecake, opt for the Biltmore location!

Don't waste your time with this location. It used to be our go-to, as we have a four year old who loves to come here.  They are currently going through a remodel, and you'd think no one ever worked as a server before.  We've currently been waiting 20 minutes for our drinks. Which include a coke, beer, and chocolate milk.   The pregnant hostess couldn't have been more rude, after I thanked her twice for seating us. We had 3 waiters stop, look at us, and continue walking before someone asked if we had been helped. That was about 10 minutes before our orders were taken.   We won't be back.

I really want to love this place. Like someone else said, I have a love/hate relationship with this market. You will not find better prices, but you get what you pay for. The Mesa location is ALWAYS a zoo. I just got back from the AJ location (a little off the beaten path but way less crowded) and I got 3 packets of strawberries for $1. My son eats strawberries everyday, I couldn't pass it up!   We get the strawberries home and maybe got a bowl full out of the 3 packets. They were all moldy or about to turn. I'm so disappointed as I love to shop local. I also live in Phoenix, so what it costs in gas to get out there, isn't worth the product I get. We did luck out with some lemons, peaches, watermelon, and carrots. But, its just not worth 2 hours out of my day to make the drive. I'll pay more and shop at Sprouts instead.

We stayed here over the weekend for my husband's 30th birthday. It was a staycation although neither of us had ever been here before. It was alright, but if given a choice, I would stay somewhere else next time.  The first thing I would like to address is the valet parking, its a nice perk. But when they don't offer self parking and they force you to do it, they should not charge you $20 a day.  The staff was friendly although we had to ask 4 different people about the bar hours because everyone kept giving us a different answer.   The pool and outdoor bar hours are very weird, and pretty inconvenient for weekend guests. The South Pool has a bar that closes at 6 on the weekends. We didn't check in until after 4 so by the time we got to our room, got changed, and got down to the pool, the bar was closed. I must also point out that they decided to close early that day because it was sprinkling. I thought that was very odd as anyone who has lived through monsoon season in Arizona knows it doesn't stay raining for long. The pool itself is open 24-7 but to not have drinks readily available was annoying. On Friday and Saturday nights (I think just through the summer) they have a pretty good fireworks show at 9:15, viewing available at the South Pool.   We went to Bourbon Steak for dinner. It was excellent and by far the best part of the weekend. It's expensive. It's not someplace you want to dine with kids. Expect to spend at least $150 for a decent dinner for two, excluding drinks, appetizers, and/or dessert. We spent almost $250 for three drinks, one salad appetizer, two steaks, two side dishes,  and one dessert.  The room itself was nice. Very clean. We had a nice view of the TPC and a nice little balcony that we enjoyed after the summer rains. It was a little bit of a walk to get to, but the resort is spread over 60 acres. You can tell the resort has been there for awhile, it looks old, some of the carpets are worn and have stains. But overall it wasn't too bad.  The reason I am giving it two stars is because of parking, the bar hours, and the check-in time. I realize such a large resort needs time to clean rooms, etc, but it doesn't give you much time to enjoy the place unless you are staying several days.

I am writing this review as I am sitting in the waiting room. They are running an hour behind. AN HOUR! This is very typical, and not only that but it takes weeks to get in. Please stop accepting new patients. I have a complicated medical history, which is the only thing that's kept me at this practice for so long.   First, I do like Dr Hunt. She is very knowledgable. But I do agree with another poster about her bedside manner. I hardly feel like she even knows me (even though she's been my doctor for 5 years and delivered my son).   Everyone in the office is really nice. They are just extremely unorganized. 3 people have left and rescheduled in the 30 minutes I've been sitting here because they've been waiting so long.   I also agree about the phone calls. Don't plan on getting a call back from anyone. I've left numerous messages for Dr Hunts nurse/assistant and have never heard back from her. Never!   The office is clean and easy to get to. Pregnant ladies beware, it is on the second floor. There is elevator access.   I think it's time to find a new doctor. The wait times, combined with being shuffled in an out very quickly just isn't working for me anymore. I want a doctor that knows me, that I feel comfortable with, and an office that will return a phone call.

So, I've decided to give Desert Jewel one more star upon my update.  My original review was from last week. Right after I wrote that not so nice review, I met with Dr Hunt. She answered all my questions, and I told her my husband and I were ready to start a fertility drug earlier than we had originally planned. I felt like she listened, and didn't think twice about trying to convince me otherwise. It was probably one of the best appointments I've had with her.   So really, my complaints aren't so much with her, or the niceness of the staff, its just about the way the office is run.   I was supposed to start that medication today, but it was contingent upon my ultrasound results from yesterday. Dr Hunt's medical assistant was in the room while I was getting my ultrasound. I made it very to clear to her that I needed a call back from someone today because I needed to start the medicine on this exact date. She assured me Dr Hunt or herself would call me first thing in the morning.  It is now 420 in the afternoon and I just got off the phone with Erin (spelling?) in the front office....ONLY because I called to get my own info. Erin was great, answered my questions and gave me the go ahead to start the drug. Then she double checked to make sure I didn't have any other questions.   I just don't understand why its so hard to get a call back? I really do like coming here aside from the long waits, and other complaints. Everyone is very nice and I would like for Dr Hunt to continue to be my OBGYN. Please, just manage the office better!   I must also add, that my appointment was at 215 yesterday, I was in, out, and done with my ultrasound by 245. That was record timing. I don't know if it was just an off day, or if things have shaped up regarding the reviews. I hope it continues to be like that.

I am writing another review for this place because I am so disgusted with the treatment I've gotten as a pregnant patient.  I was called a week ago and was informed that I had failed the 3 hour glucose test; a test in which you take when you are pregnant. I will be 28 weeks tomorrow. Dr Hunt has been my OB for over 5 years and I am pretty sure she still has no clue who I am. Anyway, I was told that I do have gestational diabetes and that they were sending me to a diabetic counselor. I was told the counselor would contact me. Again, its been a week and I have heard nothing. Way to drop a bomb like that on a pregnant woman, and leave her hanging.   I've left several messages with her medical assistant, and I've even tried talking with the front desk. To get Dr Hunt on the phone is impossible, do not even try. And to get her medical assistant to call you back is nearly impossible. The message claims that someone will return your call in 48-72 hours. 72 hours is 3 days. What if I was in labor? Or had a question about my high blood pressure? This is completely unacceptable for a doctors office. If I could switch OB's at this point, I would. And I am disappointed in myself that I haven't taken more control of the situation and I've allowed this office to treat me this way.  To not even return a phone call to put my mind at ease is absolutely awful and has left me with the worst experience I've ever had with a doctor. I'm sad I won't get a great experience as this pregnancy will likely be my last.    Do yourself a favor and do not go to this office, ever.

Every single time I've come to this location, they forget my salad dressing. How hard is your job? Really? This is the closet location to my parents house, where I take my son swimming often during the week. It's 20 minutes away. We got all the way home and once again, no dressing. Must be my fault for continuing to come to this location and expecting someone to do their job correctly.

I've waited quite awhile to write my review, but since I just recommended this office to a friend, I figured it was time. We are currently 18 weeks pregnant with our IUI baby!   I've never had a male doctor before, and due to having to do the steps by a schedule, I got the pleasure of working with both Dr Z and Dr Larsen. I loved them both. I wish they could be my OB for this entire pregnancy.  Everyone at all the offices (we went to all 3) is so nice. They remembered us, and were very welcoming. The longest we ever had to wait was probably 20 minutes. Considering I now wait over an hour to see my regular OB, I miss this office dearly. Each office is clean, decorated nicely, and they have the most up to date technology.   We were walked through each step thoroughly, and I appreciated that we weren't just a number. Everyone took the time to make sure we understood what was going on and that we didn't have any questions before leaving. The first test I did, I had read horrible things about on the internet. Due to the radiation, my husband could not come back into the room with me during the test. I was bawling when Dr. Z and his nurse came in. They calmed me down and assured me it wasn't anything like I'd heard. I figured they were just trying to get me through this, but when the test was done, and I realized they had actually told the truth, it restored my faith in doctors. He made me as comfortable as possible and the testing was a breeze. Both doctors always remembered us, and asked us about other things going on in our lives. I like having some kind of a relationship with someone who is helping us with such an intimate part of our lives.  We ended up going the IUI route and got lucky on our very first try. I cannot thank the entire team enough for being with us on this journey and helping us get to where we want to be. If we decide we would like to add to our family again, I won't hesitate to come back!

We took my parents here for Father's Day dinner last month. We had never been before but had heard good things and were looking to try something new. I think Eddie's delivered.   The place inside is small, but has a large patio. I loved the decor and it felt like a nice mix between casual and upscale. We were seated at a large table in the back, so it was nice to be able to spread out.   We had my 3 year old son with us and they gave him a dry erase board and some markers to color with. I thought it was a nice touch (much different than the standard crayons) and it kept his attention for most of the night.  The food was really good. We started with the chicken lollipops. Loved those! I had the burger with the pretzel bun. It was REALLY good. The bun made it. My dad and husband both had the bacon infused meatloaf and loved it. My mom had the chicken and really liked it.  My son had the mac & cheese. I also tried it, and it was really good, and he loved it, but be warned if your kids don't like foo-foo gourmet type mac & cheese, this isn't for them.   In my opinion, what made the meal was the drinks we started with. I love red sangria, which I ordered, and loved it. But my mom ordered the white sangria and OH MY HEAVENS. If you go here and get nothing but the white sangria, you will not regret it. It was fabulous.   The service was really great. My dad thought he started having an allergic reaction to a spice on the chicken lollipops (he has yet to figure out what the spice is that he is allergic to. This wasn't the first time, and I'm sure won't be the last until he gets a food allergy test done). So we casually asked the waiter if he knew what the spices were, because we were curious and thought we could narrow it down. He did not have the slightest clue but went and talked to Eddie himself about the spices used for the chicken lollipops. It was no big deal and it wasn't a severe reaction, and he came back with as much info as he could for us. We thought that was a really nice touch and appreciated his inquiry.  The place isn't cheap, but you get a lot of food. And bottom line, the food is good. I would love to come back to try their happy hour!

Don't waste your time with this location. I've been here 45 minutes, on a Driday late afternoon, and no one ha touched my car since it came out of the wash.  3 other cars have been driven up after mine that have gotten immediate attention.   The employees that clean and dry the cars do nothing but complain about their job and and the tips they aren't getting. Wonder why?

Update since I wrote my review 2 minutes ago. One of the workers came up to me and asked if they could rewash it because of the water spots. That is how long my car sat there and no one touched it.   I have now been here for over 45 minutes.  ^This was months ago but I thought it was important to finish the review. I still have not been back.

This is the worst Starbucks I've been to. I've lived across the street for 10 years, so naturally we adopted this as our go to coffee shop.  I've tried giving them the benefit of the doubt bit after today's drink, I'm done. The employees are nice, but incredibly slow. The drinks are always watered down, and never flavored enough.   I just ordered a Carmel Frap. It came thin and melted, with hardly any Carmel flavoring. It's white in coloring. This is the last blunder I'm allowing. It's ridiculous that they think Starbucks (the king of coffee shops) would be okay with these products being served. If I could return my drink, and give them no stars, I would.   I'll be going elsewhere from now on.

I have been meaning to write a review about this place for quite sometime. We had our rehearsal dinner here back in April of 2009. The Chef was so amazing and so accommodating.   We were able to rent out the entire place for a private event, which isn't large to begin with but its very romantic and intimate. He created a wonderful menu for our guests upon our request which was different from any regular restaurant fair, and different from what we were serving at our reception. That was important to my husband and I as we had a lot of people from out of town attending and wanted to give them a great experience.  There were candles everywhere and beautiful flowers, it was just a great experience. I will admit, I was skeptical but it turned out to be a beautiful night.   The only reason I am giving this 4 stars, is if I remember correctly, it is cash only. If you are like me, you don't carry cash, like ever. And there is no set menu. Chef Chris cooks with local ingredients and the menu changes everyday.  But the food was great and the portion sizes were more than what I expected.   I believe they close for the summer, since most of the seating is outside so make reservations once they re-open! Also, come with an open mind and open palette. It's also BYOB so come prepared and you will have a great evening. Its nice to find a small, intimate place in such a busy, fast-paced metro area. It will feel like you are somewhere else!

Let me preface this by saying if you don't want to read my entire review, don't, and just book an appointment! Highly recommend!  I actually found Glow on Yelp and decided to try it out as its not too far from where I live. Its a little off the beaten path, which I really appreciate as its never been busy when I've walked in. Dolce and their ridiculous lines come to mind. I made an appointment with Stefani for a facial. The receptionist (I'm sorry I haven't gotten your name, but you have blonde hair!) is super sweet and accommodating.  We spent a good 45 minutes talking about my current routine, products, their lines, services, etc. She was very thorough and knowledgable. Again, I can appreciate that as I'm paying good money. She knew exactly what she was talking about, down to the chemicals in the products and what they do. They offer organic natural lines too which is great for expecting moms.  I went back about a week later to exchange some makeup. No questions asked, no problem. Lauren, the manager, was just as pleasant. She knew her stuff. She gave me a handful of samples when I asked about a sunscreen she could recommend. Little touches like that go a long way with me.   After chatting with her some more, I was convinced I needed to try a chemical peel. I had some questions in regards to what I need to stop or continue with my current routine, and Stefani called me within hours to go over everything.  I have an appointment in a week for my peel!  Not to sound too repetitive, but everyone is just great. So nice, professional, and makes you feel right at home. I feel like they  know me as soon as I walk in the door, and I've only been 3 times, twice to get makeup and once for a service. So happy to have found this place!

This is the worst location. I will never go here again. We stopped by on a Saturday morning, it was dead. Great!   We ordered 2 sprinkles donuts. I could not believe what they actually gave us. Maybe 20-25 sprinkles TOTAL between the two donuts.   Customer service was good and speedy. But what they actually gave us was not worth it. IDK if Dunkin has gotten too big for their britches, the product just isn't the same anymore. And seriously with the sprinkles? I'll opt for Bosa or another local place any day.

This review is based solely on convenience, as we haven't actually been able to get here during their hours.   They close at 1230 on a Saturday, which, for working families, is the easiest day to get to places. And their website says they close at 2pm. We are in search of a place to get swim lessons for our son, but we will go elsewhere.

In the last year, my husband and I have discovered these new types of theaters that offer a luxury experience. We are regular patrons of the AMC Esplanade but wanted to try iPic for a date night. We loved it!   I thought the premium seats were the most comfortable about of all the luxury theaters we have tried. I am never going to a regular theater again. Ever. You have a blanket and pillow waiting for you when you buy the premium seats. My only complaints are the hand railing blocked some of the screen, and the recliners were not made for tall people. My husband is 6'5 and could not recline the seat, have his legs out straight, and not kick the head of the person in front of him. Oh, and one more complaint, I thought the menu could be a little bigger and offer a little more variety. I just wasn't wowed by the choice, they seemed very comparable to other theaters. The truffle fries, were delicious!   Our waiter got to us quickly and his service was excellent.   The prices for the tickets were a little pricey ($54) but the food and drinks were $46 with tip. So we figured that would be close to the total of a dinner at an upscale restaurant.   We got to iPic like 10 minutes before our movie started so we didn't have time to sit around and have some drinks before, but the bar next door looked pretty cool. I noticed the typical Scottsdale crowd, so IDK if I'd venture over there anyway. Maybe!  Overall, I enjoyed the experience and we will definitely be back!

Eric just left our house about 10 minutes ago. We had our Honda Odyssey done. It looks AMAZING! He was super fast, professional, nice to work with, and the job looks great. We submitted an inquiry through their website on Wednesday, he had several openings, and was out at our house on the following Monday.  My husband is currently trying to figure out a day he can have his truck done. I cannot say enough about how pleased we are with the finished product, I will be sure to update pics after the two week period. Having someone come to you is an added bonus that happened to work perfectly for us and something we greatly appreciate!

My husband and I tried Astor House for a lunch date today at the recommendation of one of his co-workers.   What a gem! We were literally in, and out in about 20 minutes. We were 2 of 6 people in the whole place. The service was SO fast and friendly. The smell when you walk in is just lovely. They don't have a super large menu, which I appreciate with BBQ because it can be overwhelming. But you have a good selection from the menu they do have. The portion sizes are big. And you get to dress your meat the way you want. The sauces are awesome! They have beer and wine.   I know my review is all over the place but it was just so good and we were so pleased.   My husband had the tri-tip, and hot sausage. I had the pulled chicken sandwich. We shared a side of cole slaw and mac n cheese.  They source from other local places as well.   We will definitely be back!

I have been wanting to try Drybar forever! So, when a friend was getting married on a Thursday, I figured it would be the perfect opportunity.   Whoever booked my appointment over the phone was fabulous. She was so friendly, answered all of my questions, and got me in exactly when I needed to.  I arrived a few minutes early, not knowing what to expect. I waited a few minutes and was taken back promptly for my appointment with Katie. I explained to her I wasn't really sure what I wanted, but that it needed to be quick. I also hadn't washed my hair since Monday in preparation for a possible Uptini, which is what my appointment was scheduled for. I showed her a few pictures on Pinterest, she gave her professional opinion, we agreed on a style and she went to work.   Now, this is important: My hair was done in a half hour. A HALF HOUR!! She was super fast and it looked great. I had planned on being there for at least 1.5 hours. If you need a quick updo, book with Katie. You will not regret it.   Everyone was friendly, it was clean, not too crazy busy, and they had The Devil Wears Prada playing. So fun! I'd love to try this with my girlfriends one day.   The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because there was literally no conversation during my appointment. I wasn't sure if I caught Katie on a bad day or if she was just in a super hurry to get me in and out like I asked. I just kind of felt like she was annoyed with me, I hope she wasn't!!  I'll definitely be back.

I came back here last night for just a blowout before date night with my husband. It's miserably humid in AZ right now and I didn't want to even attempt doing my own hair.   I booked online yesterday morning and to my surprise there were still some evening appointments available.   I got there a few minutes early, and was greeted by Brittany promptly at 6 (my appt time) to get started.  She was great. I loved our conversation. She asked what I was comfortable with as far as products in my hair and listened to what I wanted. I loved the way she shampooed my hair! So gentle, yet enough for it to be a blissful experience. I'll be adding a floater next time.   I was out by 715. I have long, very think hair, so I anticipated it being a longer appointment. It wasn't too busy. The receptionist was a delight. I had such a better experience here than last time, which wasn't even that bad. My only complaint was that it felt really hot in the salon. And I know a blow dryer was on me for a good amount of time. But even before that, it felt extremely warm. But I will definitely be back!! Hoping to making this a weekly visit

We have adopted this as our Chick Fil A because its the closest one. My son loves chicken nuggets. We are here at least once a week.   Service is always great, friendly, and quick. But this review is specifically about my visit earlier today.   I went inside because I needed to order some party trays for this afternoon. I believe she's a manager, and I already forgot how to spell her name but it starts with a T, was FABULOUS. She greeted me right away, asked how she could help, and then offered me a seat so we could sit down and discuss my order.  Another guy asked me if he could get me a drink, so I ordered a cherry coke with full intentions to pay for it. He said it was on the house. Sweet!  While discussing my order, the manager asked if I wanted to do some cookies to, I hesitated because I had not tried them and before I could answer, she ran back into the kitchen to grab me one. A warm, chocolate chip cookie. It was delicious! Then another employee brought me a milk, just as a nice gesture. He told me it was the best way to enjoy their cookies.   Its been a long time since I have had such good service. I know they've gotten a bad rap in recent years for the owners religious views, but great customer service will keep us coming back. This is how customers want to be treated, and we definitely take note and remember!  Not only was I in and out in less than 10 minutes for a large order, they offered to cut the cookies a certain way so it would be easier to serve the kiddos at the school party this afternoon. I so appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into taking care of me today!

I was surprised by all the reviews that had less than a stellar experience. So my husband and I decided to go during lunch,  to avoid having a huge bill to pay for in the event that we had a similar experience.  Holy hell. This was awesome! Go for lunch if you aren't sure about dinner. We arrived a little after 11am, and the place had a few customers but not many. It was quiet. And our service was quick. The place is decorated really nicely, and they even kept the original booths from Beef Eaters. Loved the old country music they played! Reminded me of my grandma and I even got a little teary-eyed while waiting for our food. What a wonderful moment I had with my husband on a random lunch date.   Our server was Sarah, she was phenom! Very quick, polite, asked if we had any questions, attentive, and even brought my husband a new dessert plate because the one she gave him looked spotty. We didn't even have to ask for drink refills. She was just great and I can't say enough about her.  We ordered an app, lunch, and dessert. For the appetizer we had the toast n jam n cheese. It was small but enough to satisfy 2 people. It tasted great and the sweet onion jam is to die for!   For lunch we ordered the chilled corn soup and gumbo. Both were great. For dessert we ordered the beignets. Only 2 come in an order but 1 is enough for one person. They are fairly big. They came out fresh and covered in powdered sugar. It was a neat presentation.   We will definitely be back, can't wait to try brunch and dinner!
