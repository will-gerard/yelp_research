This place is a staple for when my preschooler needs to let out some energy and we're all hungry. Food is always fresh, service is always outstanding.

We love Carrabbas.  This is our staple go to at least once every few months.  The food is always fresh and cooked to order.  It always tastes great.  For the price, the amount of food you get is great.  The ambiance is perfect, and our three year old loves it too.

My husband and I are fairly well versed in sushi restaurants.  This place is WAY overpriced and the food is subpar at best. They don't have a kids menu and they refused to make just a bowl of noodles for our 3 year old.  It took forever for service and then forever for our food.  The best tasting thing was the miso soup, bulgogi was bland, sushi was bland, calamari was overfried and just not good.  Service wasn't great either.  So overall we just spent $40 on a bland dinner and won't be coming back.  Sorely disappointed.

I asked my neighborhood Facebook page who they'd recommend for A/C services as ours died yesterday. They recommended Qual-Tech. I called at about 9AM and a technician was at my door at 10:45AM same day. He talked my husband through the issue and left to get the part needed. He returned 20 minutes later and had the issue fixed up in no time.   The work was done quickly and the company was great. The prices were reasonable. No complaints and we will definitely use them again.

You get what you pay for. Is the sushi astounding? No. Is it good? Yes! And it's cheap. It's decent food for a good price with a cool setup. Our son loved the conveyor belt with all the food.

Dwayne cleaned our carpets and tile today and did an exceptional job. The customer service was fantastic and the price was good. His equipment is top notch and our floors look great! We've already set an appointment to get the rest of our rooms cleaned. Smells like a new home!!!

I've been to this adorable coffee shop probably 4-5 times now. The owners are so friendly and cheerful and I love supporting a local business. I'm a big fan of their chai tea and their chicken Caesar salad. The baked items are delicious and everything is reasonably priced. I'm craving another visit now just writing this!
