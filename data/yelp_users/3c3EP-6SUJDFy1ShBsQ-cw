This is a great little place. Kind if off the beaten path but we'll worth it. The food is great quality and very well priced. Always check the daily specials, everything has been great.

Had an hour to kill, stopped in for a beer. As I am trying to close out, they begin doing a software update on the computer. Mind you, this is at 5:30 pm. Needless to say, they couldn't read my debit card.  The waitress told me there was an ATM in the corner I could use. It cost me $3 to use the ATM, plus my bank charges me $2.50. It cost me $5.50 to buy a $6 beer. Who runs a business this way. I will never be back and will tell everyone I know never to come here. What a joke.
