Took Duke for the first time today and he loved it!  Well, insofar as a dog who is like a cat around water can love a bath!  Tethers everywhere and loaner leashes to keep your dog behavin'.  And the accessories!  The Duke picked out a toy right away.  You simply cannot beat a bath and nail trim for $15!  This place is so loved, we've implemented doggy dates once a month.

3 hrs for a SmartCar oil change?! Outrageous. I even had to cancel the complimentary car wash I waited so long.  And don't expect to get good AT&T or Verizon service in the wait area.  The SA was very nice, but came out 3 different times to upsell what totaled $1700 in repairs (for a $9000 vehicle!). Very nice customer service and waiting area, but its tough to give more than 2 stars when a simple oil change took more than twice as long as the 1 1/2 hrs they told me to expect.

Great breakfasts, veerrry attentive staff, and dog-friendly!  What else can I say?  Oh yeah, wonderful patio with outdoor bar, and quaint French-inspired bathrooms (waterclosets? :) ).

Jon shot my business photos over 2 years ago. He did such a wonderful and professional job that I am still getting referrals as a result of the head shot he chose. I'm planning to get updated shots done in 2010!

I've used Jon's services for a professional headshot a few years ago, and I STILL get compliments on it.  He's a fun & talented guy who's track record speaks for itself.

Customer service can't be better. And the coffee is delicious too!
