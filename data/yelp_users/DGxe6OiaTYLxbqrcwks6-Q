First time we went I was very impressed...owner is such a nice man. Food was really good.  Our seconds experience we ordered for takeout and not as good. Latest time we had a groupon. We were there for at least 2 hours. It was very warm, none of the tables were clean, service was terrible, there was a little girl running back and forth screaming and worst of all was the food. They have gotten very skimpy. I think our food was sitting for a while before it was served because all of it was cold. Too bad because it was so good the first time.

I really think this is the BEST BREAKFAST I have ever had!  The 3 times I have eaten here it has been an hour and a half wait!  Other than that I would give it 5 stars...Food is great, staff is friendly

Love this place!  Amazing yogurt and very friendly owner and staff.  My son loves their boba.  Would go everyday if I was not worried about gaining 100 pounds!

My husband had gone to a different location than Ahwatukee and said how great it was.  He stopped on the way home from work one night and got us a pizza.  I was not real impressed, thought the sauce was a little sweet and the crust was just ok, kind of soggy.  A few weeks ago we tried again and ordered the specialty spinach pie.  It was delivered cold and super soggy.  Was so bad we couldn't eat it so I called and spoke  to the manager and he gave us a credit for another pizza.  Tried it again tonight.  This time we ordered thick crust half mushroom half sausage.  It was disgusting!  Came cold again, the crust was so dry that is cut the inside of my mouth.  Sauce has way too much sugar in it.  We won't be going there anymore.  We each ate one piece then threw the whole large pie away, what a waste!!  The salad also had the wrong dressing with it and the lettuce was warm and wilty.  Sorry Spinato's but just being honest.

I love this place!  Been waiting forever for them to come to Ahwatukee!!!  Went for lunch today and was seated immediately.  Had the fire roasted chicken and it was amazing!  Fast service and food very hot and fresh!  Shelby is the best server and Tatum is the sweetest hostess!!!!

Today was my 4th visit to Pita Jungle since opening and was again served by my favorite waitress Shelby. Always greeted with a big smile and fast attentive service!  Also greeted by the prettiest and friendliest hostess, Tatum.  She always looks so cool! Tried the peanut butter banana smoothie and it was to die for!  Be back again this week for sure!

Was there with my daughter the other night and got the chicken pasta salad. Not sure what they did different but it was seriously the best chicken I think I have ever had!  Super moist and garlicky!  I love pita jungle and not just because my daughter worked there and all the staff are fabulous and attentive!  Ask for Valerie when you go,she is my favorite waitress!

I can't say enough about this restaurant!  I had never heard of this place before.  My husband took my culinary artist/famous tv chef to be 12 year old son and me to Crudo last night.  He had heard about it from a friend at work and since it is "Restaurant Week" he decided to try something new.  I can honestly say that this was THE BEST food I have ever eaten.  Flavor explosions in my mouth!!  I got to taste a variety of the menu since we all got different items.  Everything was delicious, my entree wast the best.  I had the pork belly with soft polenta.  AMAZING!!!  I will be going back very soon.

So happy we had John list our house in Ahwatukee.  He is very friendly, smart and got the job done for us!  He found us a buyer when there were no buyers to be found! John bent over backwards and even shaved off part of his commission to get the sale.  Highly recommend.
