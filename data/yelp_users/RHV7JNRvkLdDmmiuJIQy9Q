I contacted Dr Wareing's office immediately after finding out I was pregnant, based on recommendation from a friend.  I was instructed that she would see me after 8 weeks, but they had no appointments until I was almost 11 weeks.  I took the appointment.  I got a call yesterday from the doctor's office to let me know that Dr Wareing had the flu and needed to cancel the appointment.  I called back today to reschedule for a week or so out, only to be told that they would not be rescheduling my appointment.  I asked if I should call back in a week to reschedule, but was told no.  When I asked if they were telling me to find a new doctor, she replied "no, that's not what I meant."  I'm sorry, but I am already 11 weeks pregnant and now you aren't sure if you can be my doctor or not.  This doctor may be "liked" by her patients, but I was very underimpressed with the quality of the staff and their ability to handle mothers.  What happens to the patients who are due this week?  When they call in to let the office know they're in labor, are they told to wait a week?  Very disconcerting.

I love Foosia when I need a quick, healthy meal. Lightly cooked veggies and rice noodles are my favorite. And my 10 month old likes it!!
