I have eaten just about everything on this menu over the years and keep going back for more. The Stetson Chopped Salad is as fresh as ever while you can't go wrong starting with the Mini Mushroom Pan Fry as an appetizer either.  Both are well complimented with a variety wines from of their over the top wine selection. Although I've enjoyed each dish their, I am always in the mood for their bone in short ribs. They just fall off the bone and melt in your mouth. If you think two or three short ribs can't fill you up, you haven't had this plate of goodness.  (You can never go wrong with their specials either.)

Colleagues and I frequent this place on a regular basis. The enclosed patio fits big groups while serving up great salads and coal fired pie. I can't get enough of the ricotta, spicy sausage, and jalapeño thin crust pizza. Plus the patio has a desert view to boot.

My wife and I love Sassi!  We don't frequent it nearly as much these days with our busy lives, but when we do, we always enjoy it. One of us usually gets a special to try something new. Plus the view is just spectacular!

As a group of five of us arrived shortly before our 7:00 reservations, we were nicely greeted by the host and we immediately seated.  Unfortunately the table we were placed at was less than satisfactory.  It was two different size tables pushed together.  One was much larger than the other but could still only sit two of us.  The other table was one that had been brought in from the outside patio made of gated iron.  Nonetheless we requested to be moved to a more comfortable table.  As we were asked to hold for a few minutes we asked if we could start with drinks.  We were quite surprised that the answer was no.  Twenty minutes after our reservation time, we were finally moved to another table.  This too was two different sized tables pushed together.  At least this time they were both from the dining room though.  We ordered a bottle of wine as well as some cocktails.  As we are awaiting our drinks, we begin to notice how unbearably warm the dining room was.  I would have to say it was close to 90 degrees at our table.  The drinks couldn't come fast enough as we all began downing the ice waters.  We made reference to the warmth in the room to the manager and his comment was this was normal as it's an old building with an old AC.  We three appetizers to share:  the signature empanadas, the organic spinach salad, and the jumbo sautéed prawns (more like large).  All were excellent!  On to a second bottle of wine and cocktails we ordered our entrées.  Two of us ordered the short ribs, one ordered the evening special (blackened fish), another ordered the pork roast, and I ordered the grilled NY Strip.  All of us ordered an array of side dishes as well.  The short ribs came out great, but as they cooled, the flavor went bland and they were ultimately dry.  We all agreed to stick to Cowboy Ciao's short ribs. The Cajun Blackened fish too came our over cooked to the point it was hardly eaten.  The pulled pork was extra tender, but lacked in flavor as well.  My strip was cooked perfectly, but I could have the same steak at Applebee's.  Unfortunately the main dishes were far from what we had expected after reading the reviews of the restaurant.  All the portions were large, but it didn't help as the food was mediocre.  On a good note, the sides were all awesome!  Fuego brought the much needed spice to the valley with their sides.  Then we all shared a piece of their key lime pie with coffee.  We believe the coffee was a generic Folgers at best.  However, the pie, especially the crust, was some of the best key lime pie we had eaten since being in the keys several years ago.  All in all, we had great company with a poor choice of a restaurant as none of us will be heading back to Fuego Bistro.  My recommendations are if you do choose to try this place, go during the winter and only order the appetizers and desserts.

I was overly impressed with G's!  My brother and I have travelled many miles throughout California and Nevada looking for the perfect hot dog combinations and quality.  Who has ever heard of a hot dog buffet?  I had red hot Chicago style along with a bacon, chili, cheese dog topped with jalapeños.  Both make Joey's taste like they just arrived.  Plus where else can you get double fried Tatar tots, old fashioned ice cream, and a soda for under $10.  I definitely recommend this place as a must try.  (Plus Victor was more than polite and helped us understand the history of this golden gem.)

When the wife and I want a cozy little place with awesome food and drinks, we sneak to Cafe Bink's. We love the other Bink locations too, but this location is closest to the house and is always just right after a long week. Great food and service with a relaxing low key evening is just what we need from time to time.

I have yet to have a bad meal or drink at TMI. The freshness if the food and bread is unmeasurable. Try everything at least once, then start over again.

This is one of my favorite spots to accompany my wife too. The hammered copper bar top is cool while the ambiance is just plane awesome in this New Mexican cuisine restaurant. We usually start with their Chips, salsa, and guacamole while I get a beer on tap. The wife gets a prickly pear margarita or a glass of wine from their great and reasonably priced wine list.  Although I have tried just about everything in the menu and many of their specials, I find myself going back to the chile rellenos platter. They offer two chiles stuffed with one of their several different stuffings. I like to mix it up and get one topped with red sauce while the other topped with green sauce. My wife is from NM, and she has stated many times that this is by far the best spot in AZ for NM styled food.

Generally I tend to refrain from ordering a pork chop at any restaurant since most people don't know how to cook them without over cooking them, but I figured I would try one of the most difficult breakfast items on the menu... I was greatly impressed! It was juicy down to the last bite. The potatoes were nicely seasoned and the over-medium eggs were actually made perfectly to my order unlike those chainy breakfast establishments. The staff makes sure you always have hot coffee as well. Big Joe knows how to do breakfast right! I'll be back regular for sure.

Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.

Seeing how crowded and their lack of urgency, I ordered an iced coffee since the brew is usually already ready. Waited 16 minutes for an iced coffee and saw the woman pull the ready brew out if the fridge and add ice. I love the vibe, food, and music there, but will now not go back as the last three times I went there, the lack if true customer service is an issue. This is one small business I will no longer support. I'll go back to Paradise Bakery for now on.

I've been to Local dozens of times, but today stands out as one of the best service experiences I've had, not only at Local, but any place in recent months. They have it down!  Great place for good originally styled food and wine.

My wife and I finally tried CPH and were greatly surprised by everything.  The food, as expected, was superior along with the professionalism of the staff.  The ambiance too was well set as the place could hold large parties very comfortably.   We began the nigth with a bottle of wine, the original chopped salad alons with the rock shrimp.  All were exceptional!  As out main courses, my wife orded the sea scallops and I ordered the short ribs.  (Peter of Cowboy Ciao's must miss this guy.)  Both dinners were cooked to perfection and the staff never left alone.  For dessert, we had coffee and the evening's special, the donut holes with three dipping sauces.  All were fantastic.  The wife and I don't usually rate places with five stars, but this place actually gets how food and service are meant to be as one.  Can't wait until we head back.

Once again Chef Kevin Binkley creates a new place. Just had a wonderful dinner with wife and friends at Bink's Midtown. Great wine and food have successfully replaced what was once Sophie's French Bistro. One of the only places you can still get duck breast and a push pop at the same place. (Plus his traditions fries are a must.)

Haven't had a slice of Pomo's pie and am going through withdrawals. This place keeps it simple with countertop service serving up awesome pizzas, pastas, and sandwiches. Their signature pizza, the Pomo, stands up to the best pies in the valley of not smashing them. The master chef's dough and fresh ingredients does it for me.

Wow!  Chef Osso has made a collection of different cuisines that make my pallet yearn for more. From the start with a Moscow Mule to the end with actions shot espresso, the service was perfect. From the starter plate of Charred Octopus being do amazingly tender and flavorful to the smoked, yet medium-rare duck breast that I completely enjoyed. Both paired well with a bottle of Zinfandel from their wine list. A must try restaurant!

Bernie and company have done it again. I was first introduced to his superb style at Cowboy Ciao's, the he branched off to open CPH, and now the Gladly. His unique style and high quality is some of the best. Great intimate spot for food and drinks with great service.

Was excited to eat off this truck, ordered the 3AM bratwurst and still didn't have it 20 minutes later. There were only 10 people ahead of me and I don't think the guys in back don't work well when it gets busy. Had to get my money back. Maybe when they know how to improve their service, I'll try them.
