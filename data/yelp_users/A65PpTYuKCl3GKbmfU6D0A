Quality was okay and food is kind of bland. You can see the sheriff come in here quite often during lunch time. Don't try to get breakfast menu items past 11, they'll say no. Also don't try to substitute and make sure you get what you want and not what they push you to get. Sides are optional but are good.

Defalco's Italian Grocery has the best of the best! As fresh as it gets, straight from the deli. I've been to a lot of Italian delis, bakeries, restaurants, and this by far tops my list. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. When I asked the cashier what he thought would be good, he said to me "you can throw a dart on the board and be happy" and he wasn't kidding.  After you're done eating, pick something up from the deli to take home for dinner. Ricotta, Mozzarella, Salami, Pizza Dough, Tomato Sauce, Raviolis, you name it, they probably have it. I just wish it was closer to home, so I can go everyday.
