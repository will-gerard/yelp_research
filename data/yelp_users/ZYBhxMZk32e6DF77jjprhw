I live closer to the Basha's and Fry's in the same area, but always go to the location for groceries since they have an in-house Wells Fargo and I can kill two birds with one stone when I need some groceries. They have a great selection of everything you need, with great prices. Their liquor and deli sections are probably the best out of the supermarkets in the area as well. The only thing I wish I could find was large bags of frozen chicken breasts. For some reason, either they don't carry it or I can't find it. Oh, well...

I go to a lot of sports bars since I am a big for of both adult beverages and sporting events. I went here with a group of friends to watch some football and enjoy some food and drinks. We were on the patio, where they had several big screen TVs with the games. The service, drinks and food were all great, but the thing that put this place over the edge was the atmosphere. Everyone there was having a great time and seemed like a genuine sports fan. I wish I lived closer so I could visit this place more often.

I came with a group for one of my friend's birthdays. We had three lanes reserved and everything went great... well, expect my bowling. I probably scored the worst I ever have. But, I can't blame it on AMF. It's the closest bowling alley to me, so I'll be back to improve my score of 88.

For some reason I hadn't gone to this location yet, even though I am a big fan of sports, bar food, and drinks. I went this last Sunday with my roommate to watch some football. It was packed, but we were still able to get a table and our server was very friendly and accommodating even though you could tell she was busy. They have some of the best drink and food specials around and I love their patio area. I was only able to stay for a little over an hour, but I got their chicken fingers with fries. Although, they were only about average, I was still happy and will definitely be back in the near future.

The other day I was craving some Chinese food, but didn't want to drive and get it so I found China Gate online. I ordered the Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken. Since my order was over $20 they threw in some free crab puffs. It ended up being around $23 before tip which was a little more than I had originally planned, but oh well. It took about 50 minutes to be delivered, which was a bit longer than I expected, but the food was great. The crab puffs were delicious and the Mongolian Beef was great with the crispy rice that came underneath. I saved the Sweet and Sour Chicken for the next day, which was still good, but probably not as good as it would have been sans microwave. I will definitely be ordering from China Gate next time I need my Chinese food kick.

Whenever I'm out on Mill with a group of friends and the decision to go to Cue Club is made for me, you will always hear a loud groan coming from my direction.  First off, you have to wait in line for a while to get into a not-so-special bar... OK. The staff in generally not very friendly, and the whole set up of the place is not accommodating to a bar that gets jam packed. Prepare to have your drink spilled on you 1-3 times. It is basically a super long hallway with floors made of glue.  Oh, and then there are 40 odd-ball burnouts playing pool and making it impossible to maneuver at midnight on a Saturday night. Do they really need the pool tables going when they have a 30 minute wait? Can't they just play pool at a dive bar like normal weirdos? Maybe I'm just upset since I got the back of a pool stick to the rib on my way to the bathroom.  Alright, I'm being too harsh on  this place. It's generally a fun environment and the drink specials and prices are pretty good. Just in need of some changes.

First off, I've got to say that the location and decor of this place is awesome. Great job by whoever is responsible for that. This is a great place for a date, or for brunch with friends on the weekends. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. I would go more often, but it is a little on the pricy side... but well worth it.

I went here on a Sunday night with my girlfriend looking to get a drink and some food. It was a bit later, a little past 10 pm, so when we walked in we asked the bouncer if they were still serving food. He told us they were, so we decided to check it out. It was pretty empty, with less than ten people in the entire place. First, we sat down at the bar at the first floor for a few minutes and could not find either a bartender or a server so we went upstairs. We sat at the round bar where there was a young female bartender putting stuff away and setting up. We waited for at least ten minutes while she was doing this. She didn't make eye contact or say anything to us even though we were literally sitting less than two feet from her. Finally, I asked if we could get a couple menus. She rudely said something like "Uh, we don't serve food past ten" then walked away.   And so did we. I get it if you don't serve food late, but don't have your bouncer tell us you do. Also, if people come into your dead establishment looking to spend their money, maybe you should make some sort of effort to treat them like human beings. I can't wait until this place closes down and a new bar/grill opens that actually wants people to come in.  Upper Deck: I award you no stars, and may God have mercy on your soul.

Great price, solid pizza, and late hours. What more could you ask for when you're looking for some grub after the bars!

I hadn't gone disc golfing in quite a while, so I came in to buy some new discs and play with a friend of mine. The man at the shop was very helpful, and answered all of our questions. I ended up getting a putter, mid-range, and driver for under $30 after a discount. This is the place to go if you're looking to start playing disc golf or just need to pick up some new discs.

I generally prefer to go to this theater over the Fashion Square one because it has more screens/better times, is nicer, and I don't have to deal with the Scottsdale Fashion Square-ness of having to park, walk through the mall, ect. It is a little farther away, but well worth it whenever I'm in the mood for a cinematic adventure.

I've been to this place a few times since I moved to the area. It's a great "dive-y" bar with a lot of open space and tables. I'm a big fan of playing shuffleboard, so that is definitely a plus. Drink prices are fair and the crowd is usually fun-going and casual. It's a nice place to hang out with friends and have a few drinks when you want to get away from the Scottsdale club scene and just relax.

I really like this place. It has a fun feel and good prices. The crowd varies, but most of the time it's full of laid-back people looking to have some fun with friends and maybe make some new ones. I like how they have a bag-toss on the patio, although I have yet to win a game there. I still haven't tried their food yet, but when I do, I will update my review. Very solid.

My kind of bar! I'm not exactly sure how to describe it, but it's kind of like a classy dive bar. Eclectic crowd with a very casual but not gross feel to it. They have a wide selection of beers (always a plus) and also have live music quite often. Their patio area is very nice and I love any bar that has a rooftop portion to enjoy a beverage with a friend and look around the beauty of Scottsdale. It's a nice gem in the desert.

Came in mostly based on the name, as it is a great one. The decor and feel were really cool, and our server was very friendly and accommodating. I had a burger with bacon and cheese. The burger was very good and the fries were as well. They had some happy hour deals, and I got a beer on tap. I came in around 4, so it wasn't too busy, but I look forward to coming in again at night time and checking out some of their other drinks and food.

I went here for lunch before seeing a movie. After looking at the menu for a bit, I decided to get the Gargantuan since I was very hungry. Once I got my sandwich I was very happy to see that it was fully loaded. When it comes to sub sandwiches, I devour them, but I had to take a break about 3/4 the way through. I eventually finished it with time to spare to see my movie and was very happy with it. I'll be back.

I went here last weekend to meet up with some friends for drinks on a Sunday. Drinks were well priced, and I came at the right time, as it was Happy Hour. The environment was fun, but not too crazy. And the patio balcony is fun to sit and have a drink while people-watching. I haven't tried the food, so if it's good I'll bump it up to a 5 star review. I'll be there earlier next time for the mimosas... and some grub.

I've been to this location twice, and both times dealt with horrible service. Not only were our servers apathetic and ignorant of the menu; they were both unapologetically rude. She messed up almost all of our orders, and didn't even seem to care. I am usually very carefree when I go out to a sports bar, but it was starting to seriously annoy me. It's too bad, because the other BWW I used to go to in the north valley always had great service. But, this location needs serious employee "restructuring."

I went here for a game over the weekend and had a blast. I love spring training and the new-ish stadium is great. Everyone there is very accommodating and the experience is always a good one. I got to the game a little late to meet up with some friends, but had no problem getting lawn tickets ($8, can't go wrong!) Drinks are about what you expect, and the food is above average. I'll be going to as many games as I can this spring training, that's for sure!

I've been to this location a few times, but this was by far the best experience I've had. It was two Sundays ago, myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks. My friend called ahead and made a reservation. When we got there, we had a big table reserved right in front of all the TVs. Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and quick. They had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games, enjoying some beverages and eating some food. Their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and it'll keep me coming back. See ya next Sunday, Majerle's!

I went here last weekend for a friend's birthday. I haven't been to any bars in downtown Phoenix in quite some time, as I generally go out in Scottsdale or Tempe.   The crowd was diverse and friendly. 25-35 was probably the median. They had a live band playing some good tunes, and when they were on break the music on the speakers was a lot of alternative 90's music which I love and never hear at bars.  I was with a group of about 20 people and we were able to get tables/seats by the bar without any problem (something you have to pay dearly for in Scottsdale.)   They also had 30+ beers on tap. I tried a 10.5% hoppy beer whose name escapes me. It was quite good. If I had any complaint it would be that the drinks are a bit over-priced... even for someone who frequents Old Town often.  Next time I'm in the area, I will definitely be back.

I love this place. I have probably been here 30+ times and have a good time just about every visit. I really like their layout with three different stories and a rooftop bar overlooking Scottsdale. All of their bartenders and servers are super friendly, and the atmosphere is always fun. Prices a good, and they have a lot of cool promotions throughout the week. The one thing I wish they would improve is their food. It's not too great. Other than that, it's a great place to have some drinks and fun with some friends.

Came in here on a random mid-week night with a few friends. When we got there, we were greeted and seated immediately. Our server was very bubbly and explained every aspect of the restaurant and menu to us. I was incredibly impressed. We all order our food. I got the Rehab BBQ burger (11 oz) and our server recommended the pretzel bun. Food came out quickly and it was soooo good. Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. They also had a bunch of awesome dipping sauces and another bottled sauce that's to die for. Everyone I was with loved their food. I was only able to finish half my burger, and I have a big appetite. The fries were great too. It's so nice to find a nicely priced restaurant and bar in Old Town that also has great service and great food. I've already brought friends in again to try it out and they loved it too. Can't wait to go back.

This place opened recently and I couldn't wait to try it. I got the beef and cheddar brisket sandwich, and oh my it was delicious. The brisket was smoky and flavorful, and the combination of the melted cheddar and BBQ sauce put it over the edge. One of the top fast-casual sandwiches I've had. I looked at some of the other sandwiches they had and cannot wait to go back and try some new ones. I will be back... probably within the next week.

I went here opening night with a friend of mine. The line was very long, but I didn't wait in it because I somehow convinced my friend to hold my spot while I gambled. Deadmau5 was playing and we got in right as he went on. The entire place is amazing, definitely one of the top clubs in LV, and maybe the world. It had a great ambiance and just put you in a good mood. It is expensive, though. Cover was $75/ea, and drinks were about $13/ea. If you're looking for an awesome one-of-a-kind experience, check this place out... but have a couple drinks beforehand so you don't go broke.

I was sad to see Schlotzky's go away, but I went in to the new place last night with a few friends before going out to the casino. I was hungry, but didn't want to get stuffed, so I went with the small (9 inch) cheese steak sandwich. It had thinly sliced steak with cheese, mixed peppers, onions and mayo. Oh, man! It was delicious, I ate the whole thing in about two minutes. The veggies were great, and the bread was delicious and able to hold everything together without getting too messy. One of the employees let us know that they are open late (3 am) and will have a liquor license by the end of summer. Great news! I will definitely be back for a medium or large sandwich soon.
