We bought a beautiful couch and coffee table in April from the Gilbert location. It took a while before we were approached by anyone to see if we needed help, however, when one of the girls did finally ask, she referred us to the owner for some of the more specific questions that we had. The place had a steady customer flow at the time and yet the owner still took time with us. We had excellent help in making our decision and without hassle. We were made to feel comfortable about taking our time and we were never pressured to buy. When we finally did decide to purchase, we weren't on the same page about the color of couch and the owner actually had some of the guys move the coffee table to the couch color that we were debating on and we knew right then it was the right combo. I LOVE the couch so much. It is HUGE (which is great for my 6'3" tall hubby) and wide and so incredibly soft. We got the color 'Dove' but it looks kind of like a grayish sage color to us and it is perfect in our home. The coffee table is square and a worn black color and looks wonderful with the couch. We had it delivered to our home (and they actually came THAT day!!) and the guys were so polite, efficient and careful with our items. It DOES take time to get recognized by someone working there and I have noticed in the past that if I'm not looking at one specific thing but more "window shopping" they won't even approach you at all BUT If I had enough money to go buy a new bedroom set, I would in a heartbeat. This place is amazing. Love their stuff.

We went today, June 22, 2014 which is a Sunday at 1:00pm. We expected it to be busy at this time on a Sunday but it was pretty bare.   The hostesses didn't seem to know what they were doing. One of them sat my family (my husband and our 4 year old son) at a table and then we never heard from anybody again. 15 minutes and not one person came to our table despite a couple (literally only two) servers looking our way and then walking away. We decided it wasn't worth it anymore and left. On our way out, we saw the manager up front with the hostesses and he didn't seem like he was doing much. Funny that he was up front with nobody to seat and not walking around in an almost empty restaurant to make sure that the tables that were there were being taken care of.   The hostesses and the manager said, "Thanks for coming in!" without looking up at as. I glanced at all of them with a confused look and finally the girl that sat us looked right at me with an expression that said, "Wait. I sat them just 15 minutes ago...???"    They need to get a better system going. Maybe have the hostess TELL the servers that they have people seated. Or maybe have the manager manage it all. Either way, I don't know what the food tastes like because we never got there.

My husband and I visited FnB last Saturday, August 8th for our 6th wedding anniversary. We were just winging it on finding dinner and just hanging out together. We wanted something a little lighter than dinner so we stopped in here. There wasn't any seating at tables but we sat up at the bar, just the two of us. We ordered the Lamb Empanadas, the Spicy pasta salad with zucchini and the summer squash and sausage dishes for us to share together. All of them were extremely good. We also had the chocolate dessert which was delicious.   All in all it was a good experience.

My husband, son and I tried this place for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Quickly ran through the reviews before going in and decided to give it a shot.   The pizza...SO YUMMY! We are pizza fanatics and it takes a LOT to impress us but this was exactly what we were looking for. As new residents to the Phoenix metro area, I am happy to say we found a NY style pizza place we will frequent often. Not only is the pizza delicious (we had 1/2 sausage, 1/2 white pizza. LOVED both!), it is reasonably price, too.   The reason I'm only giving 4 out 5 stars is because, yes, the owner is a bit abrasive and cantankerous. He was irritated with the employees which made me feel a little bit uncomfortable. I wouldn't want to work for this man but I do love the pizza.

Have been to the Henhouse Cafe twice now, most recently on Mother's Day, and it has been wonderful both times. The strawberry cheesecake french toast is AH-mazing! The family that owns the restaurant is very nice and very helpful. I have allergies to chocolate, peanuts and tree nuts and the owner came out front from the kitchen and she made sure that we both knew about what my allergies were and what I could and couldn't have. She was awesome!   It's a cute place inside. Nicely lit with natural light and good size. Not too big, not too small.  Can't wait to go back!

I am sorry to report that my mom and I had the worst Mexican meals we've ever had last night at Gecko Grill. I had already been a guest once with my husband and that meal, over a year ago, was not impressive (I had ordered a chimichanga and it tasted very plain and he didn't even finish his meal because it was so poor), however, I wanted to give the place one more chance as maybe they were having an off day.   My mom ordered two chargrilled fish tacos ($4.69/each) and I ordered the Gecko Quesadilla Grande ($10.99). Our server was pleasant if not super quite but no biggie there. Our food came out fairly quickly and I immediately knew why. My mom's tacos looked like soggy, plain fish tacos and my "grande" quesadilla was....you guys, I'm seriously APPALLED at what was on my plate for $10.99. This was two store bought tortillas crisped so much that it didn't even look like a tortilla was the actual ingredient. If you've have canned chicken before, you KNOW the taste and that was indeed canned chicken in my "quesadilla". There was barely any guacamole (not that I was wanting a lot but I think I maybe got one or two tastes out of the 2 triangles I ate), and if their jalape√±o cream cheese exists, it didn't make it for my particular quesadilla. I cannot believe that someone has the ability to run a restaurant using prepackaged, microwaveable food.   I see all of these positive reviews and I'm sure there have been great visits but, guys, when we are talking Mexican food-the quality-you can not all be so thrilled with this restaurant. If you are, then I believe you need to go try real Mexican food. I can name, on both hands, other restaurants in the vicinity that server FAR better meals for the same amount of money. That is the real kicker here. I wouldn't even pay $6.99 for that quesadilla item. I can go to Nando's, Tia Rosa's, Serrano's, and even Mi Amigo's and Someburro and get a plate for a similar price and have to take home the extras as the portions are generous. The plate presentation of this quesadilla at GG was amateur at best. I could make that quesadilla AND those fish tacos in my kitchen with FLAVOR and then I bet it would be worth $10.99. I will not be returning and I WILL be spreading the word. Terrible food, terrible prices.

Where to start? We live in an area that doesn't really have a choice for delivery and so we chose Grace Garden over China Pearl. BAD choice.   To start, the girl that answered the phone was not very pleasant. She was impatient with me after I asked a couple of questions and definitely wanted to end the call asap. I ordered a Chicken with Mixed Vegetables, a Triple Delight, Crab Rangoons, Donuts, and chicken nuggets and fries for a little one.   It took over 55 minutes for us to get our food. Upon opening the food I knew something was up. Nothing looked fresh, it smelled funky and it was...COLD. The nuggets were just microwave nuggets (I thought they'd be more like sweet and sour chicken nuggets without the sauce), the fries were soppy wet, the donuts were burnt AND soggy (I'm used to crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside), the chicken and mixed vegetables had horrible flavor and the vegetables tasted rotten. The Triple Delight was ok except for the beef which tasted grinded and then patted into a strip and I had gristle in mine. I literally could not finish my meal.  The crab rangoons were also mushy and not crunchy whatsoever.   Honestly, I would not be surprised if the delivery kid got the order and then went to smoke a bowl or go to a friends house before delivering it to us. That or they just let our stuff sit under a hot lamp. I never thought you could really mess up Chinese food but this was proof that you actually can. That food was obviously made LONG before it ever made it to us.   I would never recommend this place to anyone and I will never, EVER be returning as a customer. Terrible.
