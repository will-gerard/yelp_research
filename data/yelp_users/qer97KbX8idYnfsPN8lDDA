My favorite restaurant ever!! Like seriously.. Ever! I just wished ordering wings wasn't that restricted. What's so hard about being able to order 2 orders of 7 wings with different sauce instead of 14 of just one sauce... I find it more difficult baking a pizzokie with 2 flavors. I still love oreganos though :)

Nice hotel and delicious restaurant (Gallo blanco)! However, the service at the pool is terrible! Waiting 40 mins for a drink and another 20 minutes to close tab is pretty ridiculous, specially when cover on weekends it more expensive than cover at some pool parties in Vegas. The pool is really nice, but I wish service was better and  cover cheaper.

So 3 months ago I had my first car accident and hopefully the only one. My back and neck were pretty bad due to the accident and my posture was already bad before the accident. Today, was my last adjustment and I feel better than ever. My posture was improved tremendously, I don't have any pain, I sleep amazingly, and my body does things it could never do before when exercising. All thanks to Dr. Steve I mean St. Steve :) He's the best!

I am a huge torta kind of Mexican, everywhere I go I have to try their Tortas. When a place specializes in Tortas I get super excited and of course the expectation is higher. So, I woke up craving a good carne asada torta today, I decided to go to this place.  The service is great they're pretty friendly which is why they get one star, the other star is for their mango agua which was pretty good. As far as the torta it was not that great, but I've  had worst. To tell u the truth I'm not sure if it was the torta or the really "depressing" environment in the place. I was the only one in there, the place has plain decor, no music, the AC didn't seem to be working, and there was flies.  I must say it has been the most depressing meal I've had in a while.

I said it once and I'll say it a million times more. HM has one of the worst costumer service out there, but I guess it matches the low quality of product.  I only shop here on emergencies.

Best after hours choice in Phoenix! Really good authentic cheap Mexican food. Good horchata! Good salsa! Good food! The long lines at 2am are definitely worth it.

Food is alright for mall food. People are not that friendly, and how do you run out of rice on a weekday at around 2pm. I asked the girl why, she said "It gets busy, we run out of rice." Ridiculous!

This place is definitely nice but it lives up for its name, bitter and twisted! The "No Standing Rule" needs to go! This place has potential but they need to get it together.
