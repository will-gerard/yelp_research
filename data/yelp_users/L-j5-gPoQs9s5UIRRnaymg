This is a great location, especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside.  Their food is flavorful, fresh and unique.  Great wine list and a fun ambiance.

Wow, I rarely feel compelled to give a restaurant such a bad review but Rio Rico earned it tonight.  We came for Cinco de Mayo which we expected to be busy so we showed up around 5 pm.  There weren't many people waiting but those that were had to figure out for that they had to sign themselves in to be seated (no greeter on Cinco de Mayo??).  The wait wasn't bad but once we sat it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to show up and ask if we had ordered drinks.  At that point we hadn't even met our server, received water, chips, salsa, menus...etc., so no, we hadn't ordered drinks.  Ordering was a total debacle.  Our server appeared to have never taken an order before.   We finally got through that ordeal only to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food.  To make matters worse, the tables near us, all of which were seated well after we were, had received their fajitas long before we did.  The server noticed that ours still hadn't arrived and assured us that they'd be right out...and they were, completely uncooked. The peppers and onions couldn't have been more raw.  They clearly forgot our order and then tried to rush it.  Whatever, we just wanted to eat and get the heck out.  Then the bill came and surprise!  We were charged full price for the happy hour drinks and of course no from the server or on the receipt that our night was a total disaster.  The food was sub par, the service was horrible and the staff seemed completely oblivious to the fact that we were being ignored.  We definitely will not be back and i would highly recommend that any prospective diners spend their time and money elsewhere.

I just can't understand all of the negative reviews that this place has received on Yelp.  I guess you can't put too much stock in a review where the person says that Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food.  Yikes, you need to get out more!  In my opinion, the food here is every bit as good as the original Tia Rosa's in North Mesa.   I've had the Fiesta Burrito, Crab Taco, Shrimp Taco, Quesadilla, and a few of their unique salsas and everything has been wonderful!  The portions are awesome for the price and the food is very fresh.    I was skeptical due to the negative reviews here but I can say after a few visits that this place should do very well.

We made our first trip to Vintage 95 this week and overall I was impressed.  The new owners have done an awesome job with the building and decor.  The interior has a nice wine cafe feel while the outdoor patio has an upscale hotel patio look complete with high end outdoor furniture and fire pits.  It's a great place to hang out and have dinner or a glass of wine this time of year.  Pros: The pulled pork and bruschetta that we had were amazing! The food was fresh, portions were nice and it all tasted amazing.  Whoever is running their kitchen definitely knows what they're doing.  Aside from the food, the building and decor were the second big selling point.  Cons: This restaurant really missed the mark with their staff.  The hostess was nice but struggled with where to put the six of us despite the fact that there weren't many people in that night (alone, not that big of a deal).  Our waiter was nice but couldn't tell us much about the menu items or specialties (they only have a one page menu at launch).  We were pleased to find wine from one of our favorite wineries, Arizona Stronghold, but really disappointed that the waiter couldn't tell our friends anything about the wine and completely butchered the location calling it Cochise Valley.  Sorry dude, it's Cochise County and that is a major flub against this AZ native.  Finally, it was great to see the owner come out and show off his new digs to his friends, but a word to the wise, we are the customers, you should make an effort to come over and welcome us and thank us for coming in.  It's repeat business from customers like us that will dictate your success in the future.  The reality is that the owner and staff form the personality of the establishment and ultimately that's what keeps people coming back (check the wait at an Anthony Canecchia or Joe Johnston restaurant to test that theory).  So, this place has a lot going for it and if the owner starts tending to his customers and can sharpen up his staff, they may have a recipe for success.

Fresh ingredients, unique flavors reminiscent of Mexico City cuisine in a well done space that feels like a restaurant right out of Polanco.  Definitely try their roasted corn and one of their signature cocktails!

This place gets better every time we come.  Fresh ingredients, generous portions and a great vibe.  Try the beer battered lobster tacos if they have them. The salmon and Maui tacos are also a must.

This was our first visit and I was thoroughly impressed. The service was great and both the ice cream and sorbet were amazing. I highly recommend the cappuccino and Mackinaw Island fudge ice cream flavors.  The lemon and raspberry sorbet were great as well.  I am thrilled to have a nice dessert spot in downtown Gilbert and I wish Petersen's all the best.
