Holy. Wow.  Took a 45 minute walk tonight to try Turkish food on our last evening in Edinburgh. Blown away by Hanedan and owner Gursel's food. I'm hesitant to say the hummus was the best I've ever had (I hate saying "the best") except it totally was. Moussaka was so flavorful, I'll definitely be trying my hand at this dish soon.  They were all so kind, and knowing we came from the states Gursel treated us to some extra tastes from the cold meze menu!  Hanedan is a hidden gem. Don't miss it.

I cannot speak highly enough of my visit to The Dogs!   While visiting from California, my friend (from Montana) knew I would like to experience some of Edinburgh's best food, and through her research found The Dogs.  Despite not having a reservation, they kindly found room for us at the bar (we couldn't believe our luck)! Rather than order two full entrees, we wanted to get a chance to experience more of what the chef and kitchen staff had to offer, so decided to share a collection of small plates.  We enjoyed a ham hock and yellow pea soup, followed by deviled ox liver with onions, bacon and mushroom, then a squash, asparagus, and chicken liver risotto, and finally mussels with a mixed spice sauce. I was impressed with each and every choice, and was unable to pick a favorite since they were all uniquely wonderful.  Easily one of the top five meals I've had in the last couple of years, and being that my work requires me to eat at a great deal of restaurants, that's no small feat!  Suffice it to say I wasn't surprised to see it's a Michelin Guide recommended restaurant as we left!   Thank you for a lovely meal and experience we won't soon forget!

This place is a joke- their service is TERRIBLE. We sat and waited for 40 minutes for anyone to come check on us (by that time, we just wanted to see how long it would take them to notice our presence) and when our server finally got there, she informed us that they hadn't realized they were missing a server. What manager has his head so far up his @$$ that he doesn't notice when his staff doesn't show for a scheduled shift?  My favorite part? Constantly noticing servers gathered chatting by the POS systems at the bar, including the bartenders! No wonder their service sucks- they're too busy having meetings of their social club.  The food? Meh. Nothing great. Not awful, but really, I can get this stuff anywhere.   Save your time and frustration and go to Toby Keith's across the way.
