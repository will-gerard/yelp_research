Ate here a few months ago and I liked it enough that I would go again. I ordered the pineapple fried rice and I had enough for leftovers that lasted me two more meals!  Only negative is that I came here with a guy that was an idiot, but that's not the restaurant's fault :P

I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food, but I love this place. for $8.50 I got the cheese enchilada and shredded taco plate that came with rice, beans, and a small cup of veggie soup. it was all extremely delicious! especially the beans. I have no idea what they put in there, but it tasted so good that I cleaned my plate (and I am a light-eater so I usually NEVER clean my plate and I usually don't even eat the side rice and beans).  I will definitely be back again. the only downsides to this place that I've seen so far are: long wait if you go at lunch rush, not located in a great neighborhood, chips and salsa are meh (would've given 5 stars if the salsa was better), and it closes at 8 PM.

Went to Los Olivos for the first time today to get my car washed. I usually just do it myself at the self service places, but I had gone on a few road trips with my dog and she left a lot of hair in the back seat, so I figured I'd let the professionals tackle it.  The Cons: -unfriendly staff, the guy who I talked to when I pulled my car in was not friendly, nor was the cashier inside -I paid for the complete works, but the vacuuming job was REALLY shoddy. My backseat floor is still covered in dog hair (see my photos). I am going to have to vacuum it again myself later. I know it's not impossible to vacuum up the dog hair, because I've done it myself in the past. -they neglected to vacuum under the seats or between the seats and console. there was still dog hair and dust between the drivers seat and console (see photo) -I guess the interior wipedown does not include wiping down the backs of the seats? -the vacuuming does not include vacuuming the trunk - which I needed because since I have an SUV sometimes my dog sits in the trunk if she is really dirty  The pros: -the employee outside who called out which cars are ready was friendly -the employees did a really good job of wiping down the front seat interior (the dashboard, sideboards, etc.) -the air freshener smell was not overwhelming  I wouldn't come back. I think I will try the self service place on 7th Ave and Van Buren St -- you drive through a car wash but you can vacuum the inside yourself. I would do a better job than the vacuumers at Los Olivos

This place is a chain restaurant, so it doesn't really need a review, but since I eat here probably once a week, I thought I'd give my take on it anyway!  I think their Greek salad is great.  It has veggies on it like cucumber, tomato, green bell pepper, and those pepperoncini peppers.  Their dressing is light and simple, which I love.  I can just order the side of Greek salad, which is like $2.80 and I feel pretty full after that.  But I usually also get a side pasta salad or side of hummus also.  The other stuff on the menu is not that great, nothing spectacular -- oh except for the chocolate cake!  I love that cake and the frosting they put on top which is thin and forms a slight crunchy crust on top.  My only complaint with the cake is that the slices are cut very inconsistently.  So sometimes I get small slices and sometimes I get huge slices.

This Subway is very convenient to my work, which I love for getting a quick and healthy lunch.  It can get busy at lunch time, but even with about 8 people in front of me yesterday in line I only had to wait about 10 minutes.  Another plus is that even though they share a small parking lot with a lot of other businesses, there are always at least a few open spots.

Haven't eaten at a Schlotsky's in years.... and now I remember why.  This location is really close to my work and would be so convenient to eat lunch at, but I just don't like the food!  I ordered a half sandwich/salad combo lunch meal.  The salad was actually decent, but the sandwich was bad.  VERY little meat and cheese and way too much shredded lettuce.  On top of that, my meal was more than $9, which is pretty ridiculous considering what you get.  Won't be back, and unfortunately still looking for a convenient and tasty lunch spot.

I go here to get my prescriptions filled and also to shop for cosmetics and stuff occasionally.  I've never had a problem with the pharmacy.  The drive thru line can take a while at times, so I try to go during the off-peak hours.  When I don't have to wait for other people in line I can drive up, get my prescription, and be done in less than 5 minutes.  and sometimes they have treats for my dog!

I love this place! (for the dessert, not the food; didn't try the food based on reviews) I'll be honest --we came because we saw they had a Butterbeer icecream float and we are huge Harry Potter nerds. But we ended up liking other stuff on the menu too. Where else can you get a huge icecream float with whipped cream and a cherry on top for $3.75? My friends and I each ordered a different float from their specialty menu (we were not adventurous enough to make up our own combo) and we each loved what we ordered. I would've drank all of mine if it hadn't been so huge.   I also love the strange kitschy inside that's kind of dusty and vintage and odd. The sad part was the jukebox at our table was broken. Next time I'll play a song for sure!  Only gripe is that it closes at 8. Don't they know most people want dessert between the hours of 8-10 pm??

This place is VERY difficult to spot if you've never been there before. It is located across the street from an elementary school's playground in a nondescript brown brick building. Look for the metal gated doors - that is the entrance. There is no parking lot, you just have to find a spot to park in the street.  My coworkers and I arrived here about 11:45 today, thinking we were going to beat the lunch rush, but we were wrong. The person in front of us ordered about TWENTY burritos to-go, so it took our food a pretty long time to get out. I would say we waited about half an hour, which kind of sucked. But the food was really good just like all the other reviews say! I ordered the rice and bean burrito with green chile sauce. I think $8 for a burrito is pretty fair, especially considering I could only eat half for my lunch and will be eating the other half for dinner tonight. Plus it's always nice to support a local business. Next time I think I'll try the enchilada.  Oh and they only take cash and they seem to run out of coins frequently, so if you have exact change that is even better. And there is no seating inside. I think they have a few tables on a patio outside, but most people typically take their food to-go.

I came here for lunch and was so surprised it wasn't packed, based on all the great reviews on here.  But, it was a rainy day so that may have deterred some people from going out.  The prices here are a bit higher than you'd typically expect at a regular Mexican restaurant, but you have to keep in mind that you're ordering seafood and seafood in the desert ain't cheap.  (well, it's probably cheap at some places but it's also probably really gross at those places).  for the non-seafood entrees the prices were lower and more what you'd expect.  I ordered a fish taco entree that came with 3 tacos and beans and rice for only $8.99, so that's not bad at all.  The fish was fresh and tender and I really enjoyed the tacos.  However, I did not care for the complimentary fish ceviche tostada thing they served - the fish there tasted a little "off" to me.  I would definitely come here again!

came here last Saturday night with a friend. the food is very good and you get a large portion - I had leftovers for lunch the next day. my only gripe is that the naan was a little more burnt/crispy than I like. I will be back to try their weekend buffet though.

China Chili is great when you want good food FAST.  I don't know how they get their food out so quickly, but it's pretty awesome - especially when you only have an hour lunch break.  I came here for lunch with my co-workers during the lunch rush and we all got our food within ten minutes of ordering.  I also came and ordered to-go after work one day and my food was also ready within ten minutes.  On top of being fast, the quality is there too.  I ordered the seafood blossom soup and it had nice chunks of shrimp and scallop in it and wasn't just all broth.  I also ordered the mapo tofu, which I really liked.  I can't say that its truly "authentic" Chinese food, but it's really tasty and I'll definitely be back!

I saw Tosca here last season and loved it.  The electronic subtitles are great, as otherwise I would be lost.  The acoustics in the Symphony Hall are awesome and my seats were smack dab in the middle of the room with the perfect view.  I like that you can bring your own bottled water and stuff too.  At least I think you can... no one stopped me or said anything.  I think it's awesome that we have this cultural experience in Phoenix!

I love ordering take-out from Chili's on days when I'm too lazy to cook something but I want food that's better than fast food.  The online ordering experience is simple.  The pick-up is convenient and right inside the back door.  Plus, their chips and salsa have me hooked for life.  I could snack on those for HOURS!

This place has the cutest and quirkest little items for sale, a great place to shop for a gift for a mom, sister, or friend! I always love the selection of cards they have too.  On top of that, their bakery case is AMAZING. I'm not a huge fan of their cookies (I like mine to be more moist and chewy, theirs tend to be drier and crumblier), but I like their tres leches cake and the old-timer cupcake (the one that looks like a big Hostess cupcake). Their gelato is really good too and made in-house with no preservatives or anything weird like that. My favorite flavor is the peach, although the mint is also interesting. Just be forewarned that it's REALLY minty, like really really really minty with actual chunks of mint leaves in it. might be good to eat on a date so you can have super fresh breath for that goodnight smooch! haha!  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the parking situation is ridiculous. I know they have a valet who will park your car for you and they validate the valet ticket so you don't have to pay the $3, but it's still an inconvenience! last time I came I had to wait almost 15 min in a long line of cars, boo.

Mmmmm... glazed donut.... I feel like Homer Simpson with how much I love the glazed donuts here.  Being from Texas, I am sorely missing glazed donuts from Shipley's.  Anyone from the south knows that those are the BEST DONUTS EVER!  But since Shipley's isn't in AZ, this place is a good second.  The donuts are soft, the inside is moist and doughy, yet light at the same time.  The glaze on the outside is sweet, but not sickeningly so like at Krispy Kreme.  and WAIT... I just saw that another review said they have Texas kolaches??  I need to get back there stat!

I filled out the "Request an Estimate" form on their website a few weeks ago to get an estimate for reupholstering my couch.  I even attached a picture for their reference.  A few weeks later and no response :(  I even checked the "spam" folder of my email to make sure no message had gotten sent there, but there was nothing from them.  It's too bad that now I will have to look for another company to use.  I really wanted to try this place, since it got such good yelp reviews but I don't have the time to track them down and I don't really trust a company that does not get back to you promptly - at least with a message like "sorry we're busy and cannot accept new customers" or something.

I've parked here on three separate trips. The parking here is super inexpensive ($6 per day if you check in on yelp and redeem the offer that pops up).  The shuttles run frequently and all of the drivers I've ever had were extremely friendly and efficient.  Not much else you can ask for in off-site airport parking!

The Sunday night happy hour here is amazing!  I'm not sure how long the happy hour lasts, but we came at 7 pm and got to take advantage of it.  They have about 10 rolls on their HH menu for only $4-5 each.  We thought the rolls would be really small bc the waitress told us they would only come with 5 pieces (instead of the 8 pieces from the regular menu) but they were just as big as rolls that I'm used to eating.  I ordered an appetizer and two rolls and I actually had to take one entire roll home because I was soooo full.  For appetizer I got agedashi tofu.  It was different than I'm used to, because the tofu pieces were pretty small, but there were a LOT of them. I'm used to larger, but fewer, pieces of tofu.  The sauce they had it in was delicious and spot on.  But I think that they do not dip the tofu in potato starch like other places do bc the outside wasn't that slippery chewy texture, it was straight up just fried tofu.  I probably would not order this dish again.  For my rolls I got spicy tuna and scallop dynamite.  The spicy tuna was what you'd except, but VERY large pieces in the roll!  I couldn't even fit a whole piece in my mouth at one time.  The scallop roll was a california roll topped with a LARGE mound of krab and scallops (cooked).  It was a warm roll.  I enjoyed it, although I was expecting the scallops to be raw!  I think I would've liked it better if they had been raw, but it was still good.  p.s. - if you check in on yelp you can score a free edamame appetizer!

This IHOP was recently renovated, so it looks really nice inside.  It's craaaazy busy here, but they try to make the wait as short as possible.  Service was fast, they got my order correct, and my omelette was delicious.  On top of that, they were having issues splitting our bill at the end of the meal so we got free brunch.  Thank you IHOP!

I tried out their Friends & Family pass yesterday (you get a free temporary pass) and I thought I would go crazy buying a bunch of stuff in bulk, but I didn't find any amazing deals.  The best deal was on toilet paper - 36 rolls for $19.  But that's certainly not worth the $45 membership fee, not to mention that it would be really inconvenient to shop here because they don't have that many locations around.  Lots of other stuff here costs only sliiightly less than it does at Wal-mart or the grocery store.  On top of that, the main reason I came was  because I wanted to buy bulk school supplies (crayons, scissors, glue) and they didn't sell any of those!  They only had one office supplies aisle and it only had stuff like clipboards and highlighters.

I took an introduction to archery class here and it was lots of fun!  Even a non-athletic, non-coordinated person like me was able to learn from the instructor and do a decent job of shooting the arrows. After we all had some practice shooting, the instructor switched it up and created some "competitions" for us - like who could shoot a balloon first, who could kill a zombie. it was fun and non-stressful, even though I was clearly the worst of the group. The instructor was also really nice and switched me to a lighter bow when he noticed the regular sized bow was too heavy for me.  He also took time to individually watch each person and give them tips on how to improve their form.  I had such a great time I'm going to sign up for one of their 6-week archery courses! I didn't have a groupon like a lot of other reviewers, but still felt it was worth my $25.  Tip - don't be late, because the class starts right on time

Updated to add that I liked the intro class so much I signed up for the 6-week beginners course.  It was also great!  We learned a lot of new techniques (each week focused on learning a new technique/tip like "how to properly hold the bow").  At the end we learned how to score ourselves with the target and we also started to shoot from further and further away from the target, to prepare for the next level.  I would 100% recommend this place, it's fun and great to have a new skill/hobby!  FYI - the 6 week course ends up being 7 weeks, because at the end they have a makeup class that anyone in class can attend, even if you didn't miss a class before.

Came here last weekend with a group of friends and had a great time shooting. The range was pretty crowded, but most are on weekends. One of my friends was a member, so I guess that helped get us to the front of the line.  We didn't have to wait for lanes at all.  It was only my third time going shooting, so I was really happy that the range officers were attentive and helpful.  They helped me improve my stance and grip on the gun in a friendly manner. I can't really think of any complaints about this place! I would come back here again.  ps - if you are a beginner I recommend getting the lighter colored targets, like the basic #11. the darker targets make it really difficult to see where your bullet hit.

This location is nice - definitely a better parking situation than the Tempe location. I'm not a fan of beer, but I still love coming here because the food is good and they usually have a delicious pear cider. Some of my favorites off the menu are the Brewer's Breakfast (only served on Sunday for brunch), the Thai hummus (spicy!), and sometimes their soup of the day is a tasty chicken curry.

I really like Outback! sometimes you are just craving red meat and you need to get your fix without a hassle.  Outback is the perfect place to go for a casual steak.  I also love their bread and their sides -- except the garlic mashed potatoes, those aren't great bc they could be creamier.   Last time I was there I ordered the carrot cake for dessert, it was pretty excellent.  I could go for another slice right now...  Oh, but I do not recommend the coconut shrimp - wayyyy too much breading on those.

Updating this review to add that their to-go and online ordering is really good.  I place my order online, pay at the restaurant, and the food is always ready when they say it will be ready.  And they've never screwed up my order and I've used the online ordering service like 3 times.  Will continue to order my steak dinners here!  oh and plus if you place an order on Wednesday night you can get a 6 oz steak, salad, side, AND dessert for like $12.99. that's an amazing deal.

This is like any other sports bar type place, but I like it better than others because they have AIR HOCKEY! and also they seem to switch up their beer menu and last time I went they had a cider on tap that I had never tried and I really liked it.  they do karaoke on Saturday night in the front seating section and trivia on Wednesdays.  I do have to say their trivia isn't great bc it seems to start really late.   so go here if you want to drink, play pool, play air hockey, and hang out.

They patched a hole in my boyfriend's tire for free (he wasn't sure why it was free... he might have bought the tires from Discount Tires, but he couldn't remember...).  We came in only like 30 minutes before they closed, but they still serviced his tire for him.

This is my new place for car maintenance/repairs!  I came here because this is where my boyfriend has been taking his car for the past few years.  He used to be a mechanic, so I trust his knowledge of cars and repairs.  He seems to think the people here are trustworthy and competent.  So far I've only come here for a simple oil change, but I liked that they were easy to schedule an appt with, employees were very friendly, they finished the work fairly quickly, and didn't try to scare me into doing a whole bunch of other unnecessary repairs like some other car places *cough* the dealership *cough*....  And the oil change cost less than at the dealership.  Overall a great experience and I'm happy to give my business to a local shop.

This restaurant is lovely!  I came here for Restaurant Week with a group of 10 and our entire experience was so easy and enjoyable from start to finish.  First off, you can make (and change) reservations online which is so convenient.  Second, parking is really easy.  There is complimentary valet OR you can just drive slightly past the restaurant and to the left and park in the hotel's back parking lot, which is what I did.  When we arrived, our table was all set up, with these really cool tree stump table settings.  One strange thing is that even though it was Restaurant Week, they didn't have those menus on the table and we had to ask for them.  The food was excellent!  I seriously LOVED the watermelon salad.  I'm so glad our server explained things to us, bc it made me appreciate even more the effort and invention involved in the dishes.  For example, the watermelon in the salad wasn't just chopped watermelon, it was actually compressed and vacuum sealed in its juices to make it sweeter and the flavor stronger.  It was delicious and so refreshing.  My short ribs entree was alright.  It was actually a lot of food and I had to take most of it home so I could have room for dessert -- which was a super rich chocolate cake with a peanut butter addition (also suuuper rich! but not in a bad way).  Overall, a really lovely meal and at Restaurant Week prices, a great deal (only $42 for 3-courses including tip and tax).  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the view isn't great from EVERYWHERE in the restaurant, and since I think you are paying more for the view, every table should have a nice spot.  Most of our view was obstructed by a wall.

I had a great experience taking my car for service here and I did not find the people there to be untrustworthy.  In fact, my experience was quite the opposite.  I brought my car in because it was making a flapping noise when I took it out on the highway.  I don't know my car jargon, but basically a plastic piece around the wheel well had broken a little and was missing some screws so it was flapping around.  The service technician told me I could order a whole new part for about $150 or he could just have his guys secure it in place with zip ties - for no charge.  He told me if it was his car he would just go with the ziptie option.  I appreciated that he was honest with me and let me know I didn't have to go with the pricier option.  It took a while longer to have my car fixed than I would have liked (about an hour and a half to have my oil changed and the part fixed) but otherwise it was a great experience.  I appreciate that they have donuts and drinks in their waiting area and a TV to keep you entertained.

I came here again to have routine maintenance and an oil change performed on my car.  This time around, I was not satisfied with the experience bc I felt that they overcharged for their services and also they recommended services that I did not actually need.  Of course, I did not know this at the time, being unknowledgeable about cars, but I told my boyfriend about everything afterwards (he used to work as a mechanic) and he told me never to go there again.  First, he told me that although they recommended that I clean out my throttle, it most likely did not need that as my car only has 20,000 miles on it, and something like usually doesn't happen until you have many more miles on your car.  Also they charged $80 for that, which he said was way too much.  This wasn't even a recommended service for the 20,000 mile maintenance (which is what I had asked them to do), according to the owners manual.  They also charged $70 for replacing the cabin air filter, which I felt was a lot.  My boyfriend said they probably saw that I was a female so they just recommended stuff I didn't need.  That is always my concern when going to a mechanic, and it sucks that they do that here.  My boyfriend takes his car to Tempe Auto, so that is probably what I will do in the future.  The good things about this place is that their waiting room is pretty comfortable, and they show HGTV on the TV which is pretty entertaining.

this is the place to go if you've procrastinated on a costume. they have a ton of stuff and they rotate in seasonal things. the employees are eccentric and fun.  there are costumes for rent and to purchase.  the only thing is the costumes are a bit pricey (which is why I recommend it for procrastinators).  if you are able to plan ahead, you'd get a much better value shopping online.

I had a crown done here two years ago and that crown has never been right.  The way it was placed it left a gap between the teeth where food now always gets lodged.  I have to floss multiple times a day due to that gap.  Also, that tooth is now extremely sensitive to hot or cold -- even room temperature mouthwash will make it hurt.  I am sure I'll have to get it redone somewhere else.  By the way, I did come in again to try and have them correct it, but all they did was shave down the crown a bit and it didn't help at all.  Also, that crown was installed on their recommendation -- prior it had just been a large filling that had fallen out.  The dentist there claimed I couldn't just get the filling done again, that I needed a crown.  I wish I had gotten a 2nd opinion!!

came here for lunch yesterday. no wait for a table and the food came fairly quickly. I ordered the steak sandwich and shared parmesan fries. both tasted excellent! the steak sandwich had big chunks of steak cooked medium to medium-well. and the fries were really addictive. it's a fun spot to hang out and really close to where I live so I'll be back - probably on Wednesday when they have a special on their burgers!

This place does great work and serves so many people in need in Arizona! It's a wonderful place for large volunteer groups and small volunteer groups and individuals.  They set your group up on an assembly line and you pack emergency food boxes.  Our group ended up packing over 1,400 boxes in less than 2 hours and then we were done!

When I'm evaluating a vet, I rate them on their (1) trustworthiness, (2) prices, (3) hours.  This place does well in all three categories.  I found them trustworthy because I came in just for a general checkup and to get my dog current on her vaccinations and they didn't try to recommend a lot of additional services or treatments. In fact, when I asked about whether my dog needed her teeth cleaned the vet was honest and told me that my dog could probably go for 1-2 more years without needing a teeth cleaning. She also recommended a good toothpaste with enzymes in it (sold for $8 at the front desk, which I felt was a reasonable price for a large tube that will last me a long time).  Prices are very fair. I don't remember exactly how much the office visit was, but certainly less than I've paid at other places.  Their hours are awesome. They are open late on weekdays and open on both Saturday and Sunday. great for when something happens to your dog on a weekend, you don't have to wait until Monday to bring them in for treatment.

I ordered takeout from here because of a Livingsocial deal. the online ordering process was really simple and easy. the food was a good value for the price (even without the deal). we ordered the carne asada plate and the chicken taco combo. it was a ton of food for two people! come here if you want tex-mex style food - meaning LOTS of cheese on their rice and beans, good guac, and great salsa

I tried the pasta, and am updating my review to reflect that I like this place better now.  I guess their salads just aren't my thing.  The pasta was so much better!  I ordered the penne primavera.  At first I was hesitant to eat what the menu described as a "pink cream sauce" but it turned out to be delicious.  The pasta came with lots of veggies that appeared to have been stir fried (maybe?).  There was broccoli, zucchini, cauliflower, and mushrooms.  If I come back, I will definitely order that dish again!  but the parking situation is still terrible.  I discovered they do have a few additional spots behind their restaurant, but it's pretty scary navigating that alley back there with cars coming and going in both directions as well as people taking out the trash.  you just have to go veeerrry slowly and carefully.

It took QUITE a while to get my tire replaced (about an hour and a half) but they were working as fast as they could. I also appreciated how they didn't try to sell me on the most expensive tires they had, the guy working at the counter told me that a lower-priced tire was actually better than the most expensive one.

I "discovered" this place via Lee Lee's market -- apparently Sun Valley bakery sells their desserts and snacks to Lee Lee's to sell to their customers.  I was REALLY in the mood for some sticky rice and I traveled to two Asian markets and one Asian bakery before I finally found Sun Valley's sticky rice at Lee Lee's!  At first I was a little hesitant, because the rice was refrigerated and felt a little hard/dry.  I decided to give it a chance anyway.  Note: before eating, put the rice on a microwaveable plate and cover with a damp paper towel.  Microwave for about 45 seconds and the rice is perfect!  I thought it was so tasty and it really hit the spot.  Next on my list is to visit the actual bakery out on 35th Ave.  It'll be a bit of a trek for me, but I'm sure it will be worth it based on the other reviews.  Can't wait!

the river is always a fun time! I would've given this place 5 stars, except that when we got dropped off at the start of the river there weren't enough tubes for my group (another group had accidentally walked off with one of ours) and the employees there were not helpful at all and basically told us - go down to the river and ask around and see if anyone has an extra tube... even though they had a HUGE stack of tubes there and they could've just given us one. annoying!  tips: -double bag keys and cash -keep your butt up in the shallows (a few in our group got scraped and banged up on the rocks) -reapply sunscreen. and reapply. and reapply. I reapplied sunscreen four times and still got burned on my legs and stomach. -bring potato chips. I was really craving some when I saw everyone else on the river eating some! -bring sunglasses you don't mind losing. I lost mine, but luckily I had gotten them free. we even saw one guy who snorkels around and finds lost sunglasses - he sells the nice ones on ebay and gives the rest away to people tubing in exchange for beer lol -at least one person in your group should wear water shoes because there are parts where someone will have to stand up and push you or pull you out of the river at the end

Maybe I haven't been to Dos Gringos in a while, or maybe this location is just grosser than the Tempe location, but this place is dirty!  The bathroom has a bad smell coming from it and everything just seems kinda filthy.  I would never ever order food from here, if their bar area is this dirty I can only imagine how gross the kitchen is... I'm not really sure why people would hang out here when there are plenty of nicer and more fun spots in Scottsdale.

I read another reviewers review of the Oktoberfest event from this past weekend, and I second everything they said. Food was lame.  The brats were a ridiculous $7, and they were served on a terrible baguette bun.  The soft pretzel with cheese was $4 and the cheese was gross, like worse than stadium nacho cheese. What REALLY made me mad is that admission came with 4 drink tickets to get beers.  Since I was the designated driver, I wanted to use some of my beer tickets for soda and they wouldn't let me!  Instead they charged me $4 for a SMALL soda.  UGH, it made me so mad.  Wouldn't come here for Oktoberfest again.  The best thing about the event was the band who played cover songs.  But would it have been so hard to find some polka bands??

This place is pretty cheesy (okay super cheesy) but still ended up being fun and charming somehow!  I came here for a food festival, but at the end of the night I walked through Rawhide to see what it was all about.  The whole place is set up like a big main street in an old Western town from the 1880s.  They have a general store with quirky, cute, and probably overpriced candy and trinkets.  There is also a free tiny museum of the West with some neat old artifacts.  There's also a replica of a jail and jail cell.  One of the favorite parts was the blacksmith shop, where a real blacksmith was working and making branding irons.  This would be a great trip for out-of-town visitors, especially kids.  They'd get a big kick out of it!

I've never tried Ethiopian food before, but now I'm a fan!  I came here on a Saturday night around 7 pm and there was no wait for my party of 6 people, which was great for us!  Around 7:30-8 the restaurant started filling up and by the time we left pretty much all the tables were occupied.  We ordered the large vegetarian platter, which is supposed to feed 3+ people. I would say it could feed 4 people comfortably.  since we had more than 4 people we also ordered the individual meat platter, and plus I wanted to try some of the meat dishes.  while the meat dishes were alright, I preferred the vegetarian dishes by far.  sadly, I don't know the names of what I was eating bc there were so many different dishes on the platter, but I really liked how they prepared the veggies.  I even liked the collard greens, which I was expecting to hate!  the bread you use to scoop up the food is really interesting, it's a thin almost crepe like bread, but quite flexible and spongy.  it pretty much has no flavor to it, it's just a means for getting the food into your mouth. I liked the texture of it though, and it enhanced the meal.

I love the pizza cookie.  Such a simple concept, but so delicious!  As I scarfed one down this past weekend I told my dining companion "I think this may be my favorite dessert ever."  The rest of the food is good, I've never ordered anything here that I didn't like.  It only gets 4 stars instead of 5 because I always feel like it's a little bit dirty - maybe because so many families come here and the kids make a mess on the floor.

I guess where you are sitting makes a world of difference in this place!  We came back for another show on a different night, and this time we were seated at the "bar" in the high-top stools.  We were facing the stage and NOT into an aisle, which was a nice difference.  No more being jostled as people were walking by.  And the bar area provided more surface area to place things on, so I didn't have to hold my purse in my lap the whole time.  This time around the show was a lot more fun!

I love this place!  I've had a lot of good memories here - graduation, musicals, plays, I've come to this venue a lot.  I think it's so cool that we have a place like this where popular traveling shows come to our town.  And the fact that parking is now free in the lot?  Extra bonus!

I'm so glad I decided to try this place!  It was a Friday night and I was debating whether I should order from the standard chain pizza restaurant, when my boyfriend suggested trying someplace new.  So we turned to Yelp and found that this restaurant was nearby and had good reviews.  We ordered the XL Philly pizza.  And embarrassingly, we finished off the ENTIRE thing.  I tried to stop myself, but it was just so good!  After two slices I was getting pretty full but I *had* to go in for a third slice.  And I reasoned with myself that it was a thin NY-style crust so not as filling as a regular crust pizza.  I liked that the crust, although thin, wasn't crunchy or burnt at all.  It was still soft and chewy the way I like it.  My boyfriend commented that he liked the way the veggies on top of the pizza still had some crunch - not soggy like at some other pizza places.  I think this is going to become one of our lazy day go-tos!

This place is really unique!  It's a family-owned business that has been in this location for many many years (I forget how many, something like 80).  They serve good quality food for low prices.  I ordered the chicken schwarma plate and really enjoyed it.  The chicken was moist, flavorful, and tender.  I did not like the green side (I think it's tabouleh?) that consisted of parsley and other things, a salad of sorts.  But I usually don't like that stuff at any restaurant.  The hummus was good and they bring you plenty of bread/pita.  While you are there, check out the little grocery market attached.  They sell some items for really cheap, such as spices and dates.  They also have goodies from other countries, such as chocolates from London and Germany.

Came here on a Sunday late afternoon and enjoyed a nice, quiet, and leisurely meal as only one of three tables there.    For starters, we ordered the fried sweet potatoes. They came with fish sauce for dipping and were pretty tasty. For our entrees, my friend ordered the Red Curry at a 5 spice level! (that's the hottest they offer!) and it was REALLY spicy. one tiny spoonful and my mouth was burning and I was gulping down water. For myself I ordered the Pad See Eiw at a 3 spice (which was much more pleasant, for me at least).  I liked my dish a lot.  It was a little heavy on noodles and a little light on veggies, but I would definitely order it again.  For dessert we ordered the purple sticky rice with mango - so pretty and tasty too!  I can never turn down sticky rice.  Wish I had some right now....  Service was great and friendly.  Our server offered lots of refills on water and checked to make sure we liked all our dishes.  All in all, a nice experience, and I will be back some time soon!

This place has a become a regular in our to-go rotation for lazy weekends.  I have to say that the best stuff on their menu is the curries.  I haven't tried a curry that I didn't like here, although my favorite is the green curry with shrimp because it comes with a LOT of veggies (bamboo, bell peppers, carrot, eggplant).  It's insane how much food they give you.  When I order curry to-go it usually lasts me for 2-3 meals!

This place is my boyfriend's heaven.  As for me, I stand around and try to stay awake while he peruses the electronics for hours.  The place has a wide variety of electronics for every tech-lover's taste.  Prices are good, although I'm sure you could find stuff online for the same or cheaper.  However, nothing beats a knowledgeable staff person to help you select the perfect gadget for your needs when you have no idea what type of specs you should even be looking for.

I will start off by saying that before I took my horseback ride I was very concerned to see for myself if the horses were treated well here.  I almost did not book a ride here based on reviews that said the horses were mistreated and the owners had been evicted from other properties, etc.  However, when I actually went to the Stables and saw the horses, they seemed to be healthy and well-fed.  Did not see any visible injuries on any of them.  Although, I did think it odd that they were tied up to posts outside all day without any shade at all.  I was thinking that especially in the summer time that would be BRUTAL... maybe even cruel.  Anyway, once we got started on the ride it became VERY apparent that my horse did not want to be on the trail.  Taffy (the horse) would NOT go faster no matter how many times I kicked her with my heels or how hard I kicked her with my heels.  I even took my feet out of the stirrups so I could kick her harder (because the tour guide was yelling at me that I wasn't kicking her hard enough) and that still did not help.  The tour guide was yelling that usually they put little kids on Taffy and even the little kids could make her go.  I found that hard to believe that a little kids could kick harder than I was.  She was just stubborn and did not want to be on the trail that day.  She also kept moaning and groaning to show her displeasure.  It made for a not very enjoyable experience for me because I was feeling bad that she was so unhappy and I was also feeling stressed by everyone telling me to kick her MORE and kick her HARDER to keep up with the group.  I am not even kidding you, I must have kicked her with my heels 100+ times in the span of a 2 hour ride.  My muscles were getting tired from kicking her so much.  FINALLY towards the end of the ride I figured out that if I kicked with my heels AND spanked her butt at the same time, she would jog a LITTLE bit... but only for a little bit and not enough to catch up to the group.  Also, that was super uncomfortable for me to do.  I've ridden horses before in Sedona and Hawaii, and it was more fun those other times because it wasn't like pulling teeth to get those horses to move.  I think this place should do more work to make trail riding enjoyable for the horses - like reward them with treats after or during the ride.  I do the same thing with my dog to make my dog associate things she doesn't like doing with something she DOES like (food)!  It's not that difficult and would be easy for them to implement.  Otherwise, they need to figure out some other way for their horses to enjoy it more so the riders can enjoy the experience as well.  Lastly, I was sooo far behind the group for most of the time that I don't know whether the trail guide was giving explanations of the history of the land or anything.  I only heard him give a few snippets of explanation as to the vegetation.  I wish there had been more educational stuff.

This is my favorite mall in the greater Phoenix area because it's got pretty much every store I'd want to shop at.  I can always find convenient parking and the mall is very well-maintained.

Cholla Trail is a fun time with beautiful views of the city. The trail has a lot of switchbacks which is nice because it means it's less of a steep climb. towards the top of the montain it gets VERY steep though and you literally have to pull yourself up onto boulders using your hands as there is no way to get up just using your feet. I'm not sure how any dog could handle the very top of the trail, but looking at other reviews it seems like some can make it! I can't imagine my dog would be able to do the very steep climbing at the end, even though she's a pretty experienced hiking dog. Also, steep going up means steep going down - I slipped a few times coming down and was a little worried about falling into a cactus! next time I will wear my hiking shoes and not just sneakers.   Parking on Invergordon Road is pretty convenient, although even at 5 am a lot of spots were full. it's entertaining to walk along Cholla Road to the trailhead and see these ridiculously expensive houses with limos parked outside :P

If you are lactose-intolerant, they still have something for you!  On the night I went, they had 5 dairy-free flavors (mango, pineapple, raspberry, lemon, and something else, which I forget...)  I tried the pineapple, which was good, but I only got the small scoop and I couldn't even finish because at the end it was hurting my tongue.  I guess it was too acidic or something.  I'm not sure how they make it creamy without dairy, but I enjoyed it.  I think next time I would try mango.  The best thing about this place is it's clean, relatively quiet, and they have comfy seats so you can sit and eat and chat with friends.

Cibo is great.  I've been coming here since 2005 and it's been a favorite for casual and intimate nights out.  The pizza is good, but not my favorite in Phoenix.  I really enjoy their salads and desserts.  The crepe with Nutella inside, fruit on top and icecream is absolutely delicious!  And I usually don't even like crepes.  The cons - no parking lot, so you have to search for street parking or use their valet service; also poor ventilation inside, so your clothes and hair end up smelling like their pizza oven; the noise level inside can get pretty loud.

Great lunch spot!  Their paninis are comparable to Pomo (not as large, but with more meat and stuff inside of them).  I love their side salad of greens in a simple balsalmic vinaigrette dressing.  Service is friendly and quick.  Can't ask for much more in a lunch place.  It didn't get 5 stars because the interior could use updating.  I guess they are going for that Roosevelt "artsy" grungy vibe.

I really love this library.  Up on the top floor there are always ample desks and kiosks for quiet studying (and homeless people sleeping, but I've never had a problem with any of them... other than snoring).  I love that you can request books online and they will be ready and waiting for you in the reserved section downstairs.  They have a TON of DVDs and CDs to check out, and you can even check out e-books for your kindle online!  I've heard the bathrooms are crazy, but even though I've been here many times I've never looked at them, will have to do that next time!

BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  The cakes in the store looked so pretty, and the girl at the counter packaged them so nicely in little cardboard boxes, I had such high hopes (it was $5 for a small slice of coconut cake so I thought it HAD to be delicious). I sat down to take my first bite and it was like a desert in my mouth - DRY TO THE BONE. Disappointed, I decided to keep eating, hoping that maybe only that one section was dry, but no, the whole slice was dry! Not even eating the parts with frosting helped to add any moisture.  I had bought two slices of the ooey gooey cake for my coworkers as a treat for them, but now I feel embarrassed to give it to them in case it sucks as badly as the coconut cake did!  I don't understand how a bakery can operate like this!

A fun little festival in the historic Heritage Square (emphasis on the little, it's only about 20 vendors and then 2 stages).  Stepping out of the parking garage, I felt transported to Japan (or at least how I imagine Japan... never been there)!  It smelled like street food cooking/being fried everywhere, the crowds were bustling and a little pushy, and there was an overall air of chaos and unique outfits/hair/costumes.  Lines for the food were looooong.  So long I didn't even bother getting something to eat although the Snoh ice booth caught my eye, as well as the Takoyaki.  I watched a few shows on one of the stages.  There was a J-pop dance group/band... I think called Pink Sugar?  I can't say that's my type of music, but I thought they put in a good effort and had good energy.  I also watched some of the shinkendo dojos perform (my boyfriend included in there).  That was also entertaining and I liked how the announcers narrated and explained things.  It was an educational experience!  Overall, a great little event.  Fun way to spend some time with family and friends a learn more about another culture.

This place might convert me to being a vegetarian! Ok... I love steak too much for that to happen...but this place really does vegetarian food right!  Everything is flavorful and filling, you don't feel "deprived" just because there is no meat.  And I'm not hungry 30 min later after eating here, like I am with most other vegetarian dining places.  This place was a favorite dinner spot for me and my friends wayyy back in college.  Hadn't been back in years, but I recently returned to try it again and was happy to find that the quality had not changed.  Still great delicious food at really reasonable prices.  My favorites here are their vegetable samosas which come out piping hot to your table, accompanied by two dipping sauces.  I also love the vegetable curry, although I wish it was more sauce-y, so I could have something to dip their yummy bread into.  Their fluffy bread is so fun because it's HUGE!  no way you could finish an order by yourself in one sitting. and I don't know if "fluffy" is quite the correct word to describe it, bc it is a bit heavier due to being fried.  probably "chewy" is a better word for it?  either way, it's yummy.  The only thing to note is that the garlic bread is super duper extremely crazy garlic-ky.  I love garlic, but this bread was too much for me.  I would stick to the unflavored breads when dining here.

parking can get pretty crazy here. I had to circle around for a good ten minutes to finally find a spot, which I only got because I stalked two people walking back to their car. the Summit Trail can get pretty crowded, but if you can tolerate the inconvenience of having to step around people or to step aside for the crazy people who choose to run up the mountain (how do they not sprain their ankles?!) then the views are totally worth it. really beautiful vantage point to see Phoenix. although my legs are sore today, I'd come back again.

I went to ASU for my undergrad and have eaten at Oregano's MANY times, yet I never noticed this place right next door!  I ate dinner here on Friday night about 8 pm. The restaurant seemed pretty empty inside and the patio was only about 60% full so there was no wait for a table. I enjoyed the chips and salsa they provide. For my entree I ordered the gaucho steak tacos with a chopped salad as my side. The chopped salad was pretty good - just your standard iceberg lettuce with some tortilla strips and an avocado slice on top.  The tacos were better and had lots of guacamole on top which I loved!  My only complaint was the steak was a little tough and stringy (got caught in my teeth a lot).   It was a nice, quiet, laidback place to enjoy a relaxed meal of above average quality food. I would come here again!

I've been eating at Yupha's since 2006, back when it was at the old location on Eliot.  I've kept coming back because the food is great quality and tasty.  Also service is friendly and ambience is nice and clean.  Can't ask for much more in a restaurant.  The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it's a wee bit pricier than other Thai restaurants for the amount of food you get.  I can usually finish all my food at this place, but at other Thai restaurants I pay less and take home leftovers.

Pros:  -food is really tasty, I did not have anything on my plate that I didn't like (I ordered the short ribs with cheddar mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans) -service attentive and friendly (at least this is true for when I went at 7 PM on a Tuesday night)  Cons:  -parking difficult and limited -price of food a little high for what you get -we noticed a small roach crawling on the wall right above our table as we were finishing our meal

I love that they have a ton of dairy free sorbets and also a few vegan gelatos! Last night I tried the vegan chocolate which was sooo rich and delicious. I ended up getting the vegan coconut which was excellent! Light, creamy, refreshing and it had bits of actual coconut in it.  I was so amazed at how they made it so creamy without using milk. I also got a scoop of the raspberry sorbet, but it wasn't a very good combo with the coconut bc it tasted too sour and tangy in comparison.   I also like that it's connected to a pizza place. A perfect one stop shop for a night out. There was plenty of comfortable seating in the dining area and it was quiet enough to easily hold a conversation. Also there was lots of interesting people watching for all the people going in and out of the bar upstairs. I'll definitely be back for more vegan gelatos the next time I'm in the area!

I was really excited to come here for Restaurant Week and I was not disappointed!  The restaurant is beautiful and you are greeted by a huge fish tank with exotic fish near the hostess stand.  Feels like a little bit of Hawaii!  I did not know this place would be so "intimate" as in dimmed overhead lighting with candles on each table.  It would make a great place for a special date night.  As for the food, I tried the tempura ahi tuna roll appetizer, the short ribs entree, and the lemon blueberry cheesecake.  My favorite was definitely dessert!  The cheesecake was thick and creamy with a sweet graham cracker crust and topped with lots of whipped cream and TONS of blueberries.  The ahi roll was good, although I would have liked it even better if it had not been fried and had just been a regular roll.  The short ribs were also good and very tender, but sooo rich and fatty.  I know that's what you should expect with short ribs, but it was almost to the point of being TOO rich.  And the flavoring/marinade on it was a bit strong and salty.  I think it would be good with a lot of bland potatoes or something to balance it out.  It did come with a mashed potatoes side, but not enough to counter all the strong flavor and fats from the short ribs.  I also like that they offer online reservations, makes it so simple and easy to plan your night out.

I like hiking here. once you get into the path and in the hills you can't hear the city traffic or noise and you only see nature around you. a nice escape from town that is only a short drive away.  last weekend I parked at the 7th St. parking lot (plenty of parking at 9 am) and took the 306 trail up to Shaw Butte until it connected to the 100 trail and back to the 306 in a big ~4 mile loop. it was a lot of fun and not too crowded! the other hikers and bikers were also really helpful in giving directions because I had never hiked there before and wasn't sure where to go.

Great green spot in downtown Phoenix!  It's fun to bring bread and feed the birds (although technically, you're not supposed to....).  There are always lots of families and kids there on the weekends and people walking their dog.  There is a small amusement park in the park for little kids with a few rides and other activities.  You can also rent a paddle boat for the pond.  I also see people fishing from the pond, although I personally would not eat fish from that water....  The only cons are that because there are a lot of birds, there is a LOT of bird poop.  And when you have a dog who likes to eat bird poop (yes, mine does, it's gross) it can be difficult to avoid all the bird droppings.  Also one time I saw two birds get in a REALLY BRUTAL fight, it was a little traumatizing.  Oh and the parking lots can get filled up on the weekends too.

came here for dim sum this past weekend and I was impressed. they have all the usual dim sum favorites and some that I've never seen at dim sum before (e.g. soup dumplings). came with a group of 12 people and our bill came out to $86 without tip. we each paid only $10 and we were all full. I am definitely coming back and bringing friends!

I love browsing the shelves at Bookman's.  There are all sorts of gems in there and it's a great place to take a date and stroll the aisles together.  You'll definitely find some interesting stuff to spark conversation. Not only do they have books, but they also have video games, CDs, audio books, musical instruments, board games, you name it!  Another big plus is that they welcome dogs on leashes!

Seriously love this theater.  The ticket prices are the same as for a regular theater, but this one is SO MUCH BETTER.  the seats recline and the leg part lifts so you are seated in the most comfortable position possible.  The seats are all really new and they keep the floor and everything very clean.  I saw Jurassic World there this past weekend and I really appreciated that we could buy our tickets online earlier and reserve seats all together for a very small service fee.

Came here for Saturday brunch with 3 other friends. There was no wait for a table, although my friends said that was a rare occurrence. We ordered the baguette with jam and butter as an appetizer, really delicious! I ordered the eggs benedict with smoked salmon as my main dish. I loved the side potatoes!  Our server was very friendly and the atmosphere of the place was really nice (except for all the flies that flew in from outside, but I guess that can't be helped). I'm looking forward to coming again and bringing my dog to sit on their patio :)

I love the symphony hall.  It is a good size venue, not too large where the cheap seats feel super far away.  Acoustics are great and the ushers are friendly.  Also the bathrooms are large enough that the lines are not too bad (if you wait until the end of intermission).

I hate that this gas station has different prices for debit/credit card users than cash users. it's false advertising to list the cash price on the big sign out front! go two blocks east on thomas and you will find gas for $.20/gallon cheaper

What a charming place to grab a meal!  I came here on a Friday night with my friends.  I fully expected a wait, from reading other reviews, but to my delight there was none.  We started off with the bread and butter board ($4).  It came with a few slices of bread, including a pretzel bread, a jalapeno cheese bread, and another kind.  The breads were all great and tasted freshly baked.  The butter it came with was delicious!  If only it had been a bit softer, it would have spread so nicely on the bread.  Two of my friends shared the cheese and vegetable boards for their meals.  The veggie board came with a wide variety of veggies, with bread and chips to eat them with.  It was also served with two little cups of dressing.  The cheese board had some different cheese, also with bread and chips, and on the sides little cups of dried fruit and some type of seeds (sunflower maybe?).  They seemed to enjoy them!  Although I heard the blue cheese was a bit strong.  For my entree I got the roasted chicken.  After my first bite, I knew I loved it.  The chicken was served at a great temperature - very warm!  It was so juicy - the juiciest piece of white meat I've ever had.  My only dislike was that they sprinkled some peppercorns on top and those were REALLY strong peppercorns.  I had to pick them off bc I didn't like the taste.  Also, they included a sauce on top of the dish that was a bit too salty.  Towards the end of eating the salt became a little overwhelming.  I liked the dish a lot, but if I came again I'd probably try something else bc they had lots of interesting stuff on the menu!  tip: it's kind of hard to find, located in the back corner of a little strip mall center type place. another tip is that they sell bundles of local veggies here for $25.  so you can come every Friday and pick up a box of local veggies if you want.  another tip: they serve brunch until 5 pm on the weekends, awesome for late risers (like me)!

The pricing at this store is super weird.  I came here looking for a cheap nightstand for the guest bedroom, but they didn't have any.  I think they try to move the big furniture out quickly, so the big furniture pieces are priced suuuuper low sometimes.  for example, entertainment center for $1.98!  but the other items are priced at what you'd expect.

We came here specifically to pick up bones for our dogs to chew on.  They have a little open fridge with beef shanks, pig snout, and others in there.  The beef shank is sold by the pound and to get two of them was a little less than $10.  That's a good bargain for a bone that will take my dog MANY hours to finish.  it's good for her teeth and she loooves it, so win-win.  They also sell other kinds of dry doggie treats in little plastic bins and there was a sign that you could custom order a cake for your pooch!

I love AHS. First of all, their facility is awesome - clean, spacious, and very nice for the dogs and cats who have to stay there (hopefully not for too long).  I helped a friend adopt his dog from AHS in December and it was a great experience. There were always volunteers on hand when we were browsing the dogs and once we found a dog that my friend liked, the volunteers were really helpful and knowledgeable when we brought in other dogs to meet the new dog and see if they would be compatible.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because when my friend adopted his dog we noticed that the dog's tail was bleeding at the tip (it's the kind of dog that gets too excited and whacks its tail around until it bleeds). we mentioned this before we took the dog home and the people there told us they would have the vet tech look at it. well, they bring the dog out to us and say "oh, we couldn't find where the tail was bleeding, it must be okay." and they didn't even have the vet tech wrap it in gauze or anything. lo and behold, when we get home the tail is bleeding again. they must not have looked very closely at the tail OR they just wanted us to take the dog home and didn't want to admit the tail was bleeding. luckily, the tail healed within a few weeks and now the dog is fine.

This place is cool!  Almost any time of day they have some rolls or apps on special.  3-6 PM is when the most stuff is on happy hour though.  I tried the Jelly Fish roll: had spicy octopus and cucumber with cream cheese inside.  I had to pick the cream cheese out (I find cream cheese in sushi revolting) but otherwise it was great! I also got salmon nigiri and the spicy tuna roll. Overall the fish tasted very fresh to me. But watch out for the spicy tuna! I couldn't eat it all because it was so spicy!  I'd definitely come here again. My dining companion and I were full and our total bill was only $20.52!

Thanks, yelp, for directing me to another hidden gem of a restaurant! I've passed by Southern and McClintock several times and never noticed this restaurant, tucked inside a strip mall/shopping center.  The food here was great.  I ordered a cup of the lentil soup (it's delicious, like the other reviews mention. tastes like pureed chicken soup? but it's vegetarian I think), the vegetable sunbusket (sort of like a samosa... not my favorite but not bad), and the Sahara salad (fresh and tasty greens and dresing).  I should've skipped the sunbuket and gotten a bowl of the lentil soup.  I did notice the service was reeeaally slow, as in slow to bring us water, slow to take our order, slow to bring us the check.  But luckily none of us were in a hurry so it didn't bother me.  And the servers were nice.

boo World Market!  I came in here looking for the "Hobbit" line of beers bc I wanted to buy them for my boyfriend to try on New Year's Eve (he called it New Beer's Eve and wanted to try a new beer that night).  I asked the man stocking the shelves if he knew where they were.  he was very friendly and went to look it up for me.  unfortunately, this store had not received a shipment of it yet (or maybe it never will, it was unclear to me).  but I specifically asked if ANY world markets in phx had them and he told me no. but I just looked online and it's available at the world market on camelback!  I totally could have bought it that night for New Year's Eve, lame.

I have been coming here for years and it's still one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the Phoenix area. I usually order either the Pho Tai Bo Vien (noodle soup with sliced beef and beef meatballs) or the Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (vermicelli with grilled pork and fried egg roll). Food is consistently good and hits the spot when you are craving some delicious Vietnamese food.  It's true that service is at a slower pace. You can go for a whole meal and probably only see your server 3 times, but I don't mind this as I hate when servers are constantly hovering or interrupting your meal to ask you if everything tastes good. Plus I am never in a hurry when I go here, so I don't mind waiting a little longer to get the check at the end of the meal.  I also think the decor is classy and the lighting is intimate, but not too dark that you can't see the food or the menu. It's a good place to take a date because it's usually not too crowded or loud and you can easily hold a conversation.  I've never noticed the extra credit card charge other revieweres mentioned, but I guess I've never had a check under $10 before. I kind of like that you have the option of paying less if you bring cash though. Saves money for both the customer and restaurant owner!

Came here for trivia on Wednesday night and it was a nice chill place to hang out.  It wasn't too crowded, yet there were enough people there to make it fun.  I ordered a pear cider, which was decent.  I also got the Guinness cake which I looooved. chocolate cake with buttercream frosting and chocolate syrup. it is SUPER rich and SUPER sweet, so if that's not your thing you won't like it.  But I thought it was amazing! I even took a picture of it, I loved it so much, but apparently my phone has lost it :(  I'd come here again for trivia or just to hang out with friends.  The food looked OKAY, nothing too spectacular.  A plus is that they validate for parking in the garage so you get a discounted rate.

I love the gyro platter! For $11 you get a ton of gyro meat, rice, lemon roasted potatoes, side Greek salad, and pita bread. No way could you eat this all in one meal. I also like that they have a drive thru (but be warned it's really slow.... Took me 20 min to make my way through and there were only 2 cars in front of me)

We came here at a great time - when it was happy hour and all appetizers were half off.  It's definitely a great deal for food!  I ordered the chicken quesadilla and calamari salad to share.  We enjoyed both dishes a lot.  They also had live music come in and the bartender was really friendly.  A cool place to hang out!

Even though it's not "cool" to like chain restaurants, Kabuki is one of my favorite sushi places in the Phoenix area. the seafood is always fresh and the fish is sliced thick (not like at Ra... don't even get me started on their pitiful sushi). I'm not a huge fan of their specialty rolls -- I just don't get the appeal of cream cheese with sushi or huge fried rolls, so I usually just stick with the basics like nigiri or spicy tuna roll or the rainbow roll.  The reason they don't get 5 stars from me is because I wish they had more specialty rolls that incorporated fresh fish WITHOUT cream cheese or fried things.  The wait is never that long here, the atmosphere is fun, and I also like that they serve you complimentary edamame with your meal!

Pros: -good selection of veggies, meats, and other items to put in your stir fry -staff was friendly when they messed up my order (they made it w/ rice instead of udon noodles) -the sirloin tip was tasty -I like the Dragon sauce -the dining area was clean and comfortable  Cons: -the stuff in the back row of the assembly line is hard to reach, at least for me. and I don't think my arms are unusually short. -you don't get a TON of food for your money, like at YC's; disclaimer: I haven't been to YCs for about 5 years so I don't know how expensive they are now. for $11.69 (including tip) I got a small bowl with udon noodles that filled me up, but just barely if you know what I mean. I was hungry again 2.5 hours later. -like other reviewers said, handles for the sauce ladles are sticky and stuff  overall, I like the healthy aspect to this place and it's a great place for vegetarians since there are so many veggies and tofu to add to your stir fry.

Pros:  -pretty decor -very clean  -best sized portions for spring rolls that I've tried in the Phoenix area -Che Thai (dessert drink) is really tasty -Cafe Sua Da (Vietnamese coffee) is really strong and sweet, even a non-coffee-drinker like me liked it   Cons:  -broth for pho was good, not SUPER flavorful but still a good meal -price is a bit higher than I would like, but not unreasonable  I will definitely be back here and hope to try dishes other than the pho!

hiked the H1 trail today (I think...) and it was about 3.2 miles roundtrip. views are okay - you are looking out at the back of a neighborhood for most of it. it's not as secluded as I would have liked, you can hear highway traffic for the whole trail. and it was pretty crowded on Sunday afternoon. since my dog doesn't react well to meeting strange dogs (and there were a ton of dogs out on a pretty narrow trail) I don't think we'll be doing this particular trail again.

Other reviews have covered everything about this place - it is small and located next to a Circle K, but the pizza is fantastic!  I actually like the pizza here better than Cibo.  I ordered the small Vegetarian pizza and the Caprese salad to share with a friend.  We were both stuffed and our total bill was only $18!  Great value for your money.  Plus the vegetarian was loaded with a variety of vegetables, including artichoke and zucchini.  I'll be back!

Duke's was a semi-regular hangout for me and my friends for their trivia and karaoke nights.  We were willing to overlook the meh food (seriously, their food used to better, now it's really not good), outdated decor, too loud TVs because it was fun to participate in those nights.  But after our last experience we are boycotting Duke's from now on.  We came with a group of 10 people.  From the start my friend told our server that we were going to split tabs.  NO mention from the server that she would not split our tab.  After eating my meal, I ask the server for my bill.  NO mention from the server that she would not split our tab.  End of the night there is a beer that has not been assigned to anyone's tab.  We all double-check our bills and they are all correct -- no one at our table ordered that beer.    Instead of the server thinking "hey maybe it's my mistake" (after all the restaurant had earlier tried to serve us a Dr Pepper we didn't order and a burger we didn't order.... so it's not like they've got the most organized system in the world) she shot at us "I'm bringing the manager" and stomped off.  Honestly, it was like a $4 beer.  I was about to pay for it, even though I hadn't ordered it, until the server started acting like such a brat.  Then the manager comes over and proceeds to berate us and tell us "this is why we don't split tabs for groups this big"  Me and my friends are all thinking "uhhh... okay... then why DID you?"  My friend even told the manager "we want to fix this mistake, we just want to figure out what happened."  But of course, instead of working with us to solve the problem, the manager just chooses to ignore my friend and keep lecturing.  Instead of talking back to her, which I really felt like doing, we just sat and let her talk down to us (even though we had done nothing wrong) and left and vowed never to return.  In the future we'll probably stick to going to Thirsty Lion for trivia nights.  The food is a LOT better, the atmosphere is nicer, and most importantly we've never been yelled at like we were little children when going there....  We even won a $20 gift certificate for getting 2nd place at trivia, but NONE of us are willing to go back there so looks like it will go un-used!

The best part about Fresh & Easy is their prepared foods. They have a lot of ready-to-microwave/grill/bake meals in their refrigerator section that are healthier than traditional frozen meals and reasonably priced ($5 for a chicken breast with roasted kale and mashed potatoes; $5 for a thai noodle salad with shrimp and veggies). They also have a lot of healthy-ish prepared sides and snacks like hummus with veggies, egg salad, caprese salad. Their party platters seem like a good option for potlucks.  Another plus is they have a surprisingly varied selection of beers and wine for being such a small grocery store.  The negatives about this place is that the price for produce is expensive. I only buy the produce that is on sale, everything else I get at Safeway or Sprouts - no way am I paying $1 for 1 apple or $8 for a carton of raspberries! Also the parking lot has those islands in the middle of their turnout lanes, BUT THEY AREN'T VISIBLY painted or anything. I came so close to hitting the middle island today when I was turning into the parking lot! What is the point of those things? get rid of them OR make them more visible!

I ate brunch here on a Saturday morning at 10 am and found the experience to be really pleasant!  The restaurant wasn't too busy and the atmosphere felt laid back and relaxed.  All of my friends and I opted to do the breakfast buffet.  We were concerned we wouldn't be able to eat $18 of food, but considering that most of the other breakfast choices cost around $15, we figured the buffet would be worth it.  I tried a little of a lot of dishes, and there wasn't anything I didn't like.  Except for the fresh strawberries.  They were a little mushy.  The standouts to me were the REALLY CRISPY and not overly fatty bacon, the cinnamon roll with maple syrup, the fresh pineapple, and the gravy that was served on top of the biscuit.  That gravy was amazing - chunky with tiny chunks of meat in it and seasoned just right.  I would definitely come back here again to do the buffet, although maybe just as a special occasion treat, since $18 for breakfast is a LITTLE steep.

This location for zpizza is really fun!  -they do this beer wristband thing where you pay for 32 oz of beer and they have about 15 taps on the wall where you can self serve yourself beer. the taps measure how much beer you've poured. so you can mix and match beers however you like and they have some really cool/fun beers that I'm sure change regularly. when we went there was a neat habanero beer and an alcoholic root beer, yum! -happy hour from 3-6 is 50% off shareables (appetizers). I got wings and bruschetta for $8, a steal!  the wings were delicious. even though they were baked, not fried they tasted awesome. they did take quite a bit longer to make than the pizzas though -there's cornhole on the front patio -lots of TVs to watch games (and the Oscars was on when we were there :) ) -really friendly servers!

I am in love with the protein pancakes here!  If you've never had them, try them.  They are pancakes filled with oats, blueberries, and I forget what else, but they taste delicious.  Especially covered in the side of softened fluffy butter and syrup they serve it with!  The texture is not exactly like the traditional fluffy pancake you are used to, but I still love them.  I just with they would update their decor a bit, as some of the carpet and stuff is starting to look worn.

Love going for a walk around this park during the daytime or even at night. At night the bridges and Tempe Center for the Arts are all lit up and look really nice. On my last walk around the lake my friend and I noticed all the little plaques surrounding the water with cheesy nature sayings/poems. Stuff like "the wind is nature's answer to any question." Anyway, it gave us a good laugh to walk around and make fun of those quotes (no offense to any of the authors).  Parking is never a problem for me. There is that little parking lot on Rio Salado near where you can rent kayaks. That place usually fills up quickly, but further down Rio Salado you can park at the Tempe Center for the Arts. Or you can park in that free lot across the street from Macayo's (I parked there during a recent triathlon and had no issues finding a space; just be sure to park in the public section and not the section for apartment residents).  Too bad they don't have more shaded areas!

This is a chic and sleek place to grab a cocktail after work. In my experience it's pretty dead on the weekend, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because the bar is so small I don't think it could fit more than 25 people comfortably.  The small parking lot shared with Starbucks and Pei Wei sucks, it's so tight to maneuver your car in there.  Luckily I live within walking distance so I can avoid that nightmare.

This Walmart is terrible and always crowded and kind of sketchy, just like all other Walmarts. However, the employees are NOT as bad as people are saying.  If you order something online and pick it up from the Online Orders service desk in back, you will probably meet Ron, who helped me when I ordered a bicycle online. He was SUPER helpful when I asked if someone could assemble my bike before I picked it up. He made sure that someone called me the next day when the bike was assembled. And when I came to pick it up and also wanted to  buy a bike lock and bike light, he took me over to the electronics section to ring me up so I didn't have to go up front and wait in line again. And he helped me take the bike out to my car and load it in the back. Awesome employee!

Participated in a really fun bachelorette party here!  We learned a burlesque chair routine.  The instructor was so friendly and was cheering us on the whole time.  I'm very uncoordinated, but I was able to follow along with the steps and didn't feel overwhelmed.  At the end we got time to take fun/funny pictures and the bride got to take a saucy picture to send her fiance.  Would definitely recommend this for ladies' night out or future saucy parties!

Love this park! it's a nice green space in the midle of downtown. every afternoon you will find runners jogging the path around the park, kids and parents playing on the playground, people playing volleyball on the sand court, and people walking their dogs. compared to where I used to live in Austin, dog owners here are VERY responsible. I rarely ever see someone who doesn't pick up after their pet. (note: the park does not have stations that provide doggy poop bags, you have to bring your own)  only reason this park doesn't get five stars is because there are quite a few homeless people who use the area for sleeping or hanging out. if you walk under the bridge toward the library you walk right into a HUGE crowd of homeless people hanging out outside the library. it can be a little intimidating.  there are two shaded ramadas in the park which you can reserve for parties or other events for a fee. the information for how to reserve one is posted on the ramadas themselves.

I've been here twice to hike the Gateway Loop trail with my dog. Parking has been easy both times. We enjoyed the hike even though it was a bit crowded.   The only con about this place is that to get to the trails you have to walk over a bridge made of metal slats which my dog HATES. She refuses to walk over it which means I have to carry her and she's not a little dog so it's no easy feat.

I love their bruschetta. I get weird cravings for it and have to eat it at least once a month. I've always had friendly servers, although they can be slow with getting the food out. I was here last Saturday morning and the man next to me walked out without eating because first his order got lost and never sent to the kitchen. then when they finally took his order they still made him wait a long time for his food. that was probably just a mistake all around, but I felt bad for the guy.

my boyfriend bought his cruiser bike from here and he's been very happy with it. when we went int the staff was friendly and helpful, but not pushy.  they were really knowledgeable about bikes and happy to let you test-ride whatever bike you wanted.  they even adjusted the bike seat and other things to really let my boyfriend get a feel for the bike.  the cons are that the bikes are pricier than what I'm used to paying. also don't trade in your bike here because they will quote you a really low value. you're much better off selling on Craigslist or something.

This restaurant is awesome. Love the atmosphere (although a little too dim) and the menu selection. I usually come here on Tuesdays when it's happy hour all day. Their guacamole, some tacos, and other small bites are on the HH menu. I can eat a full meal (sharing the guac appetizer and 3 tacos) for about $12? it's a great deal!   oh, but their desserts are nothing to write home about.

I won't be coming here anymore. The food doesn't make up for the incompetent/rude service. I called about a week and a half ago to make a reservation for 10 people on their patio. The girl who answered the phone took down my information but said that because she wasn't the night hostess, she would leave my information for the hostess who was coming in later and the hostess would call me back to confirm. I never got a call back so I figured my reservation wasn't made/was lost/whatever. I never tried to call in again because I got busy.  Well, it ends up they HAD made the reservation for me because I got a message yesterday night regarding setting up the tables. When I called them back to explain the confusion and that I wouldn't be coming in that night bc I had never received a confirmtion, Caitlyn was very curt and said "ok awesome" and hung up on me as I was mid-sentence asking if I could make a reservation for the following week.  How rude to act that way towards me when the confusion was due to your own incompetence and lack of employee-to-employee communication!  I was planning to bring in a group of 10 because I liked this place and wanted to share it with friends, but not anymore.

I can't rate the rooms or the complimentary breakfast or anything, because I didn't actually stay there.  I am only rating the service and competence of their reservations system, because I dealt with them when trying to make a reservation for one of our clients.  My company typically likes to use this hotel for reservations bc it is close to us and convenient for our clients to stay at.  However, this past time, the reservations were a mess.  First, they told us at check in that we had never put down a form of payment and filled out a permission form to use our company credit card -- we HAD and our assistant had specifically spoken with someone about this. But anyway, I decided to just put down my credit card and have my company reimburse me.  So I gave them my info, but for some reason later they asked our client for HIS credit card info and ended up charging his card instead of mine! wth?!  Makes NO SENSE.  So the next week our assistant had to call them and sort the whole mess out and get the credit put back on our client's card.  Just a totally needless hassle and so unprofessional to mess it up not once but twice.

My dining companion built his own pizza and I had the puttanesca pizza (shrimp, calamari, fennel, etc).  I liked everything except the fennel.  The spicy tomato sauce was nice too.  We got the House salad for a starter.  The small size was plenty large for both of us to share.  Nothing too remarkable about the salad, but I did enjoy it.  Since our pizzas took so long to get out to us, they gave us free dessert, which was really considerate -- we didn't even have to mention that the food took a long time or anything, they just noticed and took the initiative themselves.  We ordered the maple trifle which was really interesting.... it came with chunks of date cake, whipped cream, nuts.  Not my favorite dessert but they get points for trying something different!

Wow... I really think this place does something to "water down" its gas.  I am seriously considering filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau!  I put 8.5 gallons in my tank on Friday afternoon and proceeded to drive directly to San Diego.  my tank was empty before I even hit Yuma!  that is ridiculous - I can usually make it to Yuma on less than half a tank of gas, which is 6 gallons. something shady is going on here because Shell gasoline usually performs better than other gas stations.  on top of that, their gas prices are expensive and the price advertised on their signs is only for cash customers.  if you pay with debit/credit, expect to pay $.10 more per gallon.

I've heard a lot about Pho Thanh over the years, but I never tried it because I was a little put-off by the uninviting exterior.  I decided to finally give it a try last week and I was happy with the experience!  The inside is a lot larger than it looks from the outside.  And the decor/cleanliness is decent, typical Vietnamese restaurant.  The spring rolls here are the best I've had in Phoenix (and the cheapest!).  Their spring rolls are around $2.50 where everywhere else it's at least $4-5.  The pho was okay, though I wish it had come with a bit more meat and that the meat had not been so well-done (I like it on the medium rare side).  I still prefer Pho Dalat in Tempe (even though it's pricier) but I'll come here when I am craving Vietnamese and don't want to drive to the East Valley.

ate here on a Sunday at noon and had a great experience, no wait in line to order and plenty of free tables. the restaurant has a really clean, colorful, fun atmosphere. I ordered the carne asada taco combo that came with rice and beans. it was a lot of food, I brought more than half of it home for leftovers. I've never had rice like this before - creamy white rice with bits of corn in it. it was different, but good! I love how hot their salsa is and their chips are great too. will definitely be back here again. especially once it cools down and I can bring my dog and sit on their front patio.

I did this hike yesterday and my body is aching today, but it was so worth it!  We started out about 6 am and finished up around 11:30 (we would've finished sooner, but we got a little lost on the way back).  Lucky for us, we picked the perfect day to do this hike when the sky was overcast bc there is virtually no shade on most of this hike.  What I like about this hike is that a large portion of it is really just rock climbing, so you get a chance to give your arms a work out.  This also means you should probably bring gloves, bc some of the rocks are rough.  My boyfriend cut his finger on a rock :-(  I'm not an expert rock climber by any means, and a few places were a little "scary" bc there weren't super easy hand or foot holds to find.  So if you are afraid of heights, take that into consideration.    The views on the way up are amazing, and we were blessed with a beautiful rainbow as we were going up!  On the way down my legs were so tired they were literally shaking with each step I took.  Make sure you wear some good quality shoes.  I wore my nice hiking boots, but by the end parts of my feet were really hurting from all the downhills you do on your way back.  Make sure you wear shoes where your foot isn't slipping forward and jamming your toes against the front of the shoe, bc you're going to be in lots of pain about halfway down the trail.

To get to Tom's Thumb and back it's about 4 miles RT but those are a difficult 4 miles!  Going up it's pretty much all climbing, not much flat hiking at all.  And coming back down you have to be REALLY careful about slipping because of all the loose dirt.  I slipped like 3 times and one girl in our group took a tumble and skinned her knee, ouch!  Great view at the thumb and a fun hike, but just make sure you are prepared!  It's not a stroll in the park.  I saw lots of exhausted doggies on the trail, so if you bring yours make sure they are used to pretty demanding hiking.  I love that there's lots of parking at the trailhead and the trail wasn't as crowded as other spots.  Make sure you bring your own water bc there is no water at the trailhead!  If you are looking for a bigger challenge, there are other trails that connect up with the Tom's Thumb trail, so once you reach the thumb you can keep going higher up if you want.

They always have two non-dairy options, which is awesome.  The raspberry pomegranate was amazing.  I loved the mochi topping, but the "boba" was not my favorite.  It was not chewy tapioca boba, but "exploding" boba that was juicy on the inside.  There's a decent amount of seating inside and outside.  I love that they are open late!

Came here for lunch and had a great time! It was about 96 degrees outside, but sitting in the shade with the misters on, the patio still felt comfortable. I ordered the BLT with field greens as my side.  I liked that the salad wasn't drenched in dressing. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was some kind of herb or something they put in there.  Now for the best part, the sandwich! It had lots of thick-sliced bacon strips in it, avocado slices, tomato, lettuce, and just the right amount of chipotle mayo. I liked that they didn't slather the mayo on, so it wasn't oozing out the sides of the sandwich when I bit down.  Even though I was moderately full after eating half the sandwich, I devoured the whole thing.  I'm looking forward to when I can come back again and try something else! My coworker ordered the sanwich with prosciutto and cheese that also looked delicious.

I really like this place.  And for being a hotel restaurant, it gets extra kudos.  I kind of doubt I would ever pick coming here again (just bc it's far from where I live and bc I can get  tasty Mexican food for cheaper elsewhere), but I did enjoy my experience there.  First, decor is AMAZING.  really beautiful place and I love how the tables on the patio have flames shooting up out of the middle. literally! fire coming right up out of your table. So cool!  And they have these cute little glass cloche type things with a succulent landscape inside on each table.  It takes up a lot of table space, but it's so pretty!  I'm even inspired to try to recreate it on my own for my house.  plus the Fairmont in general is just gorgeous.  so for this reason, it's a nice place for a special date night!  Second, food is good!  not out of this world, but I definitely liked my meal.  I ordered the carnitas enchiladas and shared the guacamole sampler for appetizer.  the enchiladas were just what you'd expect, nothing much to comment there.  I really liked the trio of guacamoles we ate!  Tasted very freshly made and had some inventive combinations (like adding pomegranate seeds, neat!)  Third, there is this guy who goes around making hot chocolate.  He puts the chocolate powder mixture in this flaming glass and swishes it around and keeps adding more chocolate powder.  I really don't know how he did not singe his hands bc he wasn't wearing gloves or anything.  It was really neat to watch and it made the entire dining area smell heavenly.  Again, great place for a special date!

I live within walking distance and I love this place. My recommendations from the menu are the jalapeno cilantro hummus and the wood-fired chicken. I can't say enough good things about this chicken! Normally I don't really care if my food is "pretty" as long as it tastes good, but this chicken dish is notably visually-pleasing. With the tomatoes, spinach and mashed potatoes piled on the plate it's really colorful. Even my dining companion noted that the plate looked really delicious. And it tasted awesome as well. The only thing to note is that the garlic mashed potatoes are HEAVY on the garlic (which I love). But don't expect to have the best-smelling breath afterwards... After eating hummus for an appetizer I could only eat 1/4 of this meal even though I wanted to eat more because it tasted so good. I ate it for lunch and even part of my dinner the next day -- a huge portion of food!  I will be back here many times I'm sure.  p.s. - the only thing that wasn't good was the margarita. it tasted like the mixed stuff you buy at the grocery store. I'm not sure which tequila they use but it was cheap and gave me a headache after two sips. I couldn't even finish it, and I usually love margaritas!

so annoying to eat here during lunch! I will not be back again during lunch time. I had to take TWO hours from work today just because service was SO SLOW and parking is terrible. we ordered our food at 12:15 and it didn't arrive until 12:45. (note: none of us ordered anything that took long to cook, we ordered the broiled chicken salad and the veggie burger).  we scarfed our meal down and paid our bill, but then had to wait around another 10 minutes because our server had forgotten to bring my friend a to-go box. eventually I ended up just walking up to the food prep line and asking for a to-go box.  I'm not sure if they need to hire more staff or what, but they need to do something about the awful and slow lunchtime service.

I know nothing about video games nor do I particularly enjoy playing them.  But I am dragged in here on occasion so that my boyfriend can browse.  The place is always packed on weekends and it's a tiny store, so that can get annoying.  On the bright side, the employees seem really knowledgeable in games and are able to offer recommendations for games they think you'd enjoy based on other games you've previously played.  I'll probably be back here around the holidays to pick up some gifts and ask for their recommendations!

I like coming here to donate my clothes and household items, because it's very close to my house and because it benefits a charity that I love.  my only complaint is they don't stay open very late and I wish they had an after-hours drop box of some kind.  the store itself is pretty small, but the prices seem cheaper than other thrift stores (definitely cheaper than Goodwill).  and I think Saturdays are 50% off the entire store.

this place has super tasty food! for a casual dining place where you order at the counter and seat yourself, I was really impressed. I ordered the chicken kabob entrée with a salad as my side. the salad exceeded my expectations - it was very fresh, the lettuce was crisp, and it came with a lot of toppings: bell pepper, olives, tomato slices, cucumber, red onion, and chunks of feta cheese. the dressing was a nice basic vinaigrette.  I was expecting my chicken to come on a stick, but it was actually just big chunks of chicken on a bed of rice with a side of lettuce, tomato, and red onion.  I didn't mind because it was actually easier to eat that way. the chicken was flavorful and juicy and the rice was delicious and cooked just right. it reminded me of something you would order at pita jungle, but it cost about $3 less here.  this is not THE BEST MEDITERRANEAN FOOD I've ever had in my life, but for $9 it was a great value and really tasty food. I'd definitely come back again!

I didn't think I would like this place, because I had the idea in my head that paying for ramen at a restaurant was a waste of money. I mean, you can buy a packet of ramen for $0.25 and make it yourself at home and add your own fixings!  BUT I was wrong. it was totally worth it to pay for the ramen here. I loved their "traditional" toppings choice, very different than other noodle soups I've tried.  and they give you a LOT of food in one bowl - could easily take home  half for leftovers.  plus, the boba is good and tastes like it was made fresh that day, not hard and old like at some other places.  I'd come here again!

The Duce is a really unique place to hang out with friends.  They have an eclectic mix of attractions like a boxing ring, random vintage exercise equipment, a DJ station, drink carts, a milkshake counter.  I came here in December for brunch and it was nice because they had a lot of heaters out for us, which was necessary since the whole place is pretty much an open air warehouse.  The food we tried was good (a variety of sliders, a salad with strawberries, and mini bake mac and cheese muffins), but nothing I was crazy about or that I would crave again.  So if I came back I'd probably come for the lively atmosphere and drinks with friends.

This review is for the tapas- I came here on Saturday around 3:30 pm.  There were only 1 or 2 other tables and we were able to get a table on the patio, which was nice since it was a beautiful day out.  I ordered the Hamburg mussels and the pancetta wrapped gnocchi (based on the other yelp reviews).  I loved the mussels!  They came in a cream sauce and were cooked very nicely.  my friends were laughing at me because the presentation was a little funny in that I had to fish my food out of a bucket.  I think they could've put a little less cream sauce in the "bucket" to make fishing the mussels out easier.  the gnocchi were less impressive to me.  they were a little tougher than I expected.  I usually love gnocchi because they are soft and doughy.  it was also served with big chunks of bread, which ended up being way too much bread. I probably wouldn't order this one again.  I also tried some of my friend's roasted vegetables -- delicious!  they were cooked just right so that they still had a slight crunch, but weren't too raw.  the seasoning was basic and allowed the flavor of the veggies to shine through.  overall, I love the tapas concept!  trying lots of different inventive foods at a reasonable price is awesome in my book.  oh and the service was friendly, attentive, and prompt. no complaints in that dept!

This is the only place I'm taking to get my car washed from now on!  The people who work there are friendly and helpful.  The car wash is cheap ($10 for their most deluxe version). And you can use their air hose to dry off your car afterward if you are truly a "clean freak" and can't stand water spots -- I am not, I don't give a hoot about water spots.  I also love that their vacuums are included.  I have a dog who frequently rides in my car and fills it with her fur, so I need frequent vacuuming of my interior!  And I am more thorough than any of the people who work at the other car washes, so I prefer doing it myself than having someone else do it.  Plus, those ppl don't vacuum the trunk of my SUV, which I can do here.  They also give you a nice air freshener and rags to wipe down your dash and seats.  I'm sure I'll be back soon!

This is my favorite place for dim sum AND hot pot in the Phoenix area!  Dim sum always has a wide variety of dishes fresh from the kitchen.  You HAVE to try the coconut jello, it's one of my favorite desserts.  The consistency is fluffy, and not quite like a jello.  It's hard to describe, but so delicious.  Plus, prices are CHEAP.  I can eat here with friends and leave stuffed and only pay $10 (including tip!).  Hot pot is also great and they qive you a lot of food in each order.  I love that each person gets their own individual pot to cook meat and veggies in, so each person can choose a different flavor broth if they want.  Plus vegetarians won't get their broth tainted by meat-eaters.  The only con is if you arrive at the busy time on the weekend, you will have to wait to get your dim sum.  Best to arrive around 10 or 10:30 to avoid the wait.

I scheduled a repair appointment with this company based on a personal recommendation from my neighbor and the many 5 star reviews here on Yelp.  Because my boyfriend and I were busy and just wanted our door fixed, we did not shop around or get quotes from other companies.  That was our mistake.  What I didn't notice before I hired this company is that there are also 100+ negative reviews that are "hidden" at the bottom of their Yelp page.  Yeesh, I should have read some of those first.  In terms of service, they were top notch.  I left a message that I wanted to have a repair scheduled and they got back to me quickly.  The repair person showed up on time and did the work quickly.  My issue with this company is the overinflated prices for parts.  We ended up spending $767 to have our garage door repaired (spring, bearing, bearing plate, pair of cables, drums replaced).  When I later did my research online and asked others what a reasonable price for those repairs would be, absolutely every website and person told me a price more in the $350 range was reasonable.  So we overpaid by more than DOUBLE.  I was really upset when I learned this.  So many people told me we had been ripped off.  When I found out we had overpaid by so much, I thought for a second we had been tricked and were working with a fake company posing as A1 (as mentioned in someone else's Yelp review).  But I called twice and confirmed that we worked with the correct company.  For some reason, they just have two separate websites and two Yelp listings for the same company.  I wanted to call the company to complain about the price we were charged, but my boyfriend did not want to, so we never discussed it with anyone at A1.  However, I wanted to post this review to warn potential customers to please shop around and get quotes before agreeing to work.  I am posting my invoice so that everyone can draw their own conclusions as to whether the price is fair.  Also FYI a lot of websites say that a "lifetime warranty" on parts for garage doors is a scam, because a spring is a spring and only lasts for a certain amount of time.  The company double (or in this case... triple or quadruple??) charges you for parts with the claim of the lifetime warranty.  The company is trying to get you to keep using their services so when they come to replace your spring they'll charge you a service fee and a labor fee.  And then when the other parts wear out, they'll do the same.  You can Google it to learn more for yourself.  I hate to give a 1-star review, but I would not use them again nor recommend them to anyone, so that is the reason for the low rating.

The owner of A1 reached out to me because I was dissatisfied with the price we were charged.  He was very professional and you can tell he really cares about the reputation of his company.  He explained that A1 uses high quality parts which contributes to the higher price for parts compared to other companies.  However, he did state that we were charged more than we should have been because since we were buying multiple parts the technician should have given us a bundled price instead of charging individually for parts.  He said that the work that was performed should have actually cost about $475 and he refunded the money we paid above that amount.  He also stated that A1 will not be the cheapest company you can find to repair your garage door, but it's because they perform background tests and drug tests on all their technicians and use the higher quality parts.  I am now satisfied with our service, but I do wish we had been charged the correct price the first time around.  Since the technicians work on commission, customers should be vigilant that they are being charged the correct price.  I at least feel confident in stating that if you do hire this company, they will not be the kind to cut and run if you are dissatisfied.  They will work with you to make sure you are satisfied with their service.

This is a great place to hang out with friends and grab a meal or drink. I've been here and had dinner once. I ordered a burger and fries - it was good quality for bar food. I've also been here a few times to just have a drink with friends and hang out. It's convenient to walk over after eating at Yupha's or watching a movie at the Pollack. I like that it's not loud and they have a large selection of beer (even though I'm not a beer drinker, my friends seem to appreciate it). It's kind of odd that they close at midnight though.

I wish I could give zero stars. I live nearby so I was hoping I could use this dry cleaner. I went in yesterday with a few clothing items. Problems: 1) They didn't have their prices listed anywhere in the store 2) The woman behind the counter was rude when I asked her how much it would be to dry clean my clothing items. I found it strange that when I asked her the price to dry clean she didn't know and had to punch a bunch of numbers on a calculator to finally tell me that my suit pants would cost $6+, the skirt would be $6+ and the jacket would be $7+. I couldn't believe it. No thanks. I will be driving two miles out of my way to go to the cleaners futher north on 7th Ave that charge less than $2 per item.  I can't believe people patronize this business. Anyone who pays $7+ to get a suit jacket dry-cleaned must be a millionaire with money to burn or a moron. Don't be a moron.

The Garage is a great relaxed, yet hip, neighborhood spot to hang out and have a drink. The decor is unique and interesting and I love the fireplace. I really like that it's chill enough to have a conversation with your friends without having to yell. I'd definitely come back to try the food.

Cajun and Mexican fusion?!  I got a Blackened Catfish bowl.  There really wasn't anything "Mexican" about that bowl, except that they added some shredded lettuce and a dollop of sour cream to the top.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it.  The bowl came with a generous helping of catfish, beans, and cajun rice with andouille sausage.  The fish was truly blackened and had a little bit of a kick to it.  It was enjoyable and the fish was nicely cooked although some of the outer edges of the filet were a little dry.  I liked this a lot, but next time I'd ask for no sour cream.  p.s. my friend ordered the hush puppies, I would say skip those.

This is the first time I've ever tried hot pot in Phoenix (I'm from Houston), but I have to say that it was pretty good! I think the prices are pretty fair. expect to spend at least $35-40 (including tip) for a party of two. we ordered two meats, two veggies, a noodle, and a tofu for two people and it ended up being $37 (with tip), but we were both very full afterwards!  tip: try the ice tofu. they make it by freezing it and it changes into this strange, layered textured that I can't really describe very well, but it tastes delicious and it soaks up a lot of the broth so it's very flavorful.  another tip: the mala spicy broth is SPIICCYYY. at one point I dipped the strainer into the broth to get some noodles and I came up with a ladle of 50% chili flakes and 50% noodle.... very spicy! next time I think I'd get the half and half spicy/original, just to give my tastebuds a little break!  decor and music are really cool and our server was extremely friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and helpful (we didn't know how long to cook the shrimp for, and we didn't know the differences between all the tofus). I will be back soon :)

I've been here a few times for lunch. I debated between giving this place 3 or 4 stars, but decided on 4 since in comparison to the other dining options downtown, this is better than average. HOWEVER, I feel like the atmosphere (really cool furniture and decorations) of this place is much better than the food and service. The food is always good, but slightly off. When I ordered the BLT the tomato jam on the bread was too sweet. When I ordered the turkey sloppy joe it was again slightly too sweet and the side Cobb salad it came with was drenched in too much dressing. Also, if you go there for lunch, except to spend at least 1.5 hours there (even if you make a reservation ahead of time).  Service is not very fast at all.  Also I don't really like how tables are sooo close together that you feel like everyone around you can hear your conversation very clearly and vice-versa.  One thing I can praise wholeheartedly is the pretzel fondue appetizer.

Arrogant Butcher continues to disappoint.  I came here on Friday to celebrate someone's birthday.  The pretzel/fondue appetizer was awesome, as always, but I'm beginning to suspect that it's the only good thing on the menu -- and really, that's not very impressive because how could they possibly mess up salted bread and melted cheese??  We were headed to the art museum after dinner, so I decided to order an appetizer for my meal since I knew I couldn't finish a whole entree and I didn't want to lug leftovers around with me on the lightrail.  At first I ordered the steamed mussels, but sadly they were out of them for the night.  My second choice was the salmon rillette, which the menu described as "smoked salmon with crusty bread."  I was expecting a lox and french bread type of plate, but what came out was smoked salmon that had been mushed up into little chunks, soaked in some sort of liquid (tasted like vinegar maybe?), poured in a jar and topped with many capers.  I gave it a try and spread it on the bread, but after 2 bites I knew I did not like it.  it was mushy and sour and yecchh.  I was waiting for the bartender (we sat at the bar) to come by and ask if we enjoyed our food so that I could exchange my salmon for a salad or something, but she never did.  she only came at the end of our meal and collected my plate (still FULL of food except for the 2 bites missing) and threw all the food in the trash.  you would think the plate full of uneaten food would've clued her in that I didn't enjoy my meal, but either she didn't notice or didn't care, but just brought out the check and gave it to us without comment.  I didn't want to be fussy, so we paid and left.  My dining companion ordered the jambalaya for his meal and said it was really greasy.  Arrogant Butcher, you make me angry that you charge so much money for bleh food.  I will not be convinced to come here again, no matter how good your pretzel/fondue is!

This is an intimate and unique movie theater that shows non-mainstream films.  They always have quirky events going.  I think in April they are doing a whole alien film series featuring ET, Spaceballs, and other classics like that.  Definitely a fun place to check out to see what interesting events are coming up.  I recently attended a screening of the movie Clue and there was a costume contest among audience members to dress up like characters from the movie.  People were really into the movie and excited so it was a fun atmosphere.  I'd definitely be back again if they were showing one of my favorites.

I really like this sports arena, especially because it's close to lots of free parking. There is also a shuttle that services it.  The food selection is the regular stadium stuff, but they do have some independent vendors who serve different food.  I had a chicken teriyaki on top of a greens salad that was pretty yummy considering I was at a sports stadium.  The seats give a great view of the field.  Don't think you can ask for more in a baseball arena!

This place is cool and quirky.  If you like the vibe of Arrogant Butcher, but think their food isn't great -- this is the place for you.  This place doesn't sacrifice atmosphere for good food.  I ordered the porkwich, which came with three kinds of pork with barbeque sauce.  It was tasty and the BBQ sauce wasn't too sweet, which I appreciated.  The kale side salad wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad.

AWESOME icecream.  I sampled three different flavors before I settled on ordering the Vietnamese Iced Coffee flavor.  Everything I tried was interesting and tasty.  The staff was friendly and helpfu.  The atmosphere is cute and quirky.  They have lots of fun things for sale there.  The only con?  The cookies are terrible!  They are hard and dry and flavorless.  So yeah, don't get the icecream cookie sandwich, just get a scoop by itself and you'll be happy.  Also they have heaters on their patio which makes for a cozy time hanging out with friends!

I've been here twice and I would come back. I never painted a canvas before coming here and it has made me a fan of painting! I've even started painting in my free time at home. The teachers explain everything really well and make you feel comfortable asking questions. Your painting will turn out exactly like theirs, if you want, or you can deviate from their template and add your own special touches. It's a fun way to spend 2 hours and the time FLIES by when you're concentrating and having fun. It's also in a good location because after the class you can walk over to Mellow Mushroom or one of the nearby restaurants and get a bite to eat.  My only recommendation to them is to add new paintings to their calendar. I've already painted two that I like, and I want to schedule another visit but I'm not wow-ed by anything on the calendar yet.

Man, I feel like there are a LOT of pizza places popping up in central Phoenix, but this is now one of my favorite spots for a pizza lunch.  They have a great lunch special - half a salad and a personal pizza for $9.95.  And you can choose any salad off the menu and any pizza (they have 26!).  There was actually enough food for me to take 3 of my pizza slices home.  I have to say, I prefer this place over Federal Pizza and Pizza People Pub.

don't be put-off by the outside of this place.  it looks a bit... hole-in-the-wall-ish, which it is.  but the food here is really good (and cheap)!  I ordered their special, which came with a burrito and taquitos.  The taquitos are basically little rolled and fried tacos.  Not very healthy, but sure are delicious.  The best is when you visit the salsa bar and try some of their different salsas.  I think the special, which comes with a drink, ended up only being around $8.    The salsa bar also has some interesting offerings, such as sliced (possibly pickled?) carrots and other veggies, which we didn't try.

came here for dinner and a free show last Sunday. we unknowingly arrived in the middle of their trivia night. as far as trivia questions go - these were hard! I play bar trivia occasionally and I usually know at least a few answers. I don't think I knew a single question they asked here! and I thought it was weird that they ask ALL the questions and don't even tell you the answers until the very end. if I had been playing I would've gone crazy with frustration wanting to know what the correct answer was! it seems like the people participating were enjoying themselves though. I believe the prizes for winning trivia are a $25 gift certificate or two tickets to a show.  the food: nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. I ordered the quesadilla, to which I added steak. they shouldn't really call it "steak" because it was shredded beef. only other ingredient inside the quesadilla was a lot of cheese. it came with a side of chips and salsa and a huge scoop of sour cream. I might come here for food again, but it's nothing notably delicious.  the show: their stage/venue is really awesome with the seated bleachers in the back and standing room in the front. I love how intimate and small the stage is. we saw three local bands perform for free; they were all very different musically but I enjoyed them all. if a band I liked was playing I would definitely come back to catch them play!

Came here without an appointment to get a chip in my windshield repaired and I was in and out in 30 minutes.  Only cost $24.95 and now the chip won't spread into a bigger crack.  I am overall pleased with the results.

Really cool old-school lounge with an interesting mix of people.  Came here for karaoke on a Saturday night and had a great time!  The chairs are big and comfy.  If it weren't for all the smoke, I'd give it 5 stars, but that's Vegas for you....

when we were looking for this place we saw, from a distance, some flashing red and blue lights and we thought the police were there.  we almost reconsidered coming here, but then we realized the flashing red and blue lights were just some strobe lights they had hung outside lol.  I was a little unsure about going in because the place seemed a tad bit sketchy. but my boyfriend declared "I see old people in there, it'll be okay" so we went in...  What James L. said is true: come here for food as the SECONDARY. come for drinking and whatever event of the night (karaoke, trivia, etc.) as the PRIMARY reason for coming here and you won't be disappointed.  my boyfriend and I wanted to check this place out bc it's really close to where we live and thought it could be a fun hangout with friends. it's not very big inside -- maybe 30 seats total?  we came on a Sunday night and there was karaoke going, VERY loudly!  so we decided to sit on the patio.  would come back here with a group to do karaoke/trivia.  but I might skip the burrito and just stick to appetizers and drinks or something.  the burrito was pretty underwhelming.

Dog lovers, this is your place!  The back patio is a doggie heaven, with hooks to tie up your pooch at each table, water bowls, free treats, and lots of doggie friends for your dog to bark at and annoyingly try to play with as you try to eat your meal in peace :P  I really love the brunch here!  They have quite a variety of brunch dishes, like biscuits and gravy, waffle + bacon, brat sausage breakfast, veggie omelette flatbread, and more!  And all their brunch specials are only $10, which includes a beer/mimosa.  That's a pretty fantastic deal.  I ordered the waffle and bacon, which I thought was really delicious.  Nothing out of the ordinary, but it hit the spot.  This might become my new favorite brunch place.

I had the Thai chicken quesadilla for lunch.  It was everything I expected and more!  Delicious crispy tortilla on the outside and warm melty cheese with plenty of chicken and onions inside.  The only thing I didn't like that much was that the Thai sauce was a little too sweet.  I really loved the salsa they served on the side, and the chips were great too although a tad too thick for my liking.  I am full and happy now.

very good chicken for a fast food place. juicy meat in the chicken fingers and it tastes awesome dipped in the Cane's dipping sauce. I like that you get big pieces of actual chicken. I did not like the coleslaw, but I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general. the sweet tea is great - not TOO sweet like at most places. the worst thing about my meal was the fries. they serve the crinkly cut fries like you used to get with your cafeteria meal in elementary school. no flavor at all to the fries.   I'd definitely eat here again, but if given the choice between here and Chick-fil-a, I'd rather eat at Chick-fil-a because they use more flavor in the breading on their chicken and their waffle-cut fries are MUCH bettter than the fries here.

I have always wanted to try Pizzeria Bianco, but I didn't want to wait hours in line. So I am so glad they opened this new location!  I came at 6 pm and there was no wait for a table of 4.  However, they don't seat incomplete parties and I had to wait for my dining companions.  When everyone finally arrived, the wait was about 20 minutes, but not terrible.  The inside of the restaurant is very eclectic.  Parts of it look like a grandma's living room, while other parts have modern light fixtures.  However, somehow it all works together.  I like the little tealight candles on each candle, makes the place feel very intimate and cozy.  My friend and I shared the mixed greens salad and the Sonny Boy pizza.  I really liked the salad!  It was just plain greens with a light dressing and a few olives.  Simple and delicious and healthy.  The Sonny Boy pizza came with a meat, mozzarella and olives.  It was good, but next time I think I would add some basil, as I felt like it needed a little something "sharp" in there to add some depth of flavor.  Overall, this place lived up to my expectations and I will definitely return!

Really happy that this place stays open until 10 pm!  My car battery died and everywhere else was closed, so we came here and quickly got a new one.

love the Cajun fries here (a small order is enough for two people, trust me) and that you can put SO MANY toppings on your burger!  it's a little pricier than other fast food joints, but I feel like they use better quality ingredients so I don't mind paying a few more bucks.

Good option for lunch, but not my favorite barbeque (although I'm from TX so the standard is high). I ordered the two meat plate for $10 which came with pulled pork, brisket, and choice of side. I picked mac and cheese for my side and loved it, it had a tiny biy of a spicy kick to it. Brisket was juicy and the right amount of fatty, althoguh I did get one end piece which was dry. The pulled pork was my least favorite part of the meal. I would definitely try this place again.  This food truck parks in front of the Dept of Corrections building on Washington St. on Tuesdays and sometimes Thursdays.

It was a little confusing to find this place on my first visit.  Basically, look for the sign that says Phoenix Zoo Picnic Area and go ACROSS the street (Galvin Pkwy) from that.  This is a great spot for beginner hikers because it's more just like walking.  The trail we took didn't have any elevation gains and the views were still beautiful.  I came at 9:30 on a Saturday morning and there was plenty of available parking, but it was also freeezing that day so maybe it scared some people off :-P  See you on the trail!

I am from Texas and I am sooooooooooo happy they opened a Rudy's here!  The brisket is mouth-watering and the beans and potato salad are delicious.  The employees will give you small tastes of any kind of meat you want and you can order by the pound, half pound, quarter pound, whatever.  And they will give you unlimited white bread to eat with your meat (unhealthy? heck yes, but it tastes so good and like comfort food).  I really want to go here right now....

I bought myself a Groupon for my entire legs as a present to myself last Christmas.  I haven't quite completed all of the 6 treatments I purchased, but I have enough experience with the place that I can now review it.  For starters, they use the type of laser machine that never touches your skin, which is a BIG plus for me.  My friend got laser treatments at a different place with a type of machine that touches your skin and she actually caught a skin virus from it, yuck.  Secondly, I've always had positive, friendly interactions with the ladies who work there - from the receptionists to the technicians.  Third, they are very careful to not use the laser on you if you've recently been exposed to sun and they warn you not to go into the sun after treatment.  This prevents any adverse reaction or hyperpigmentation.  And the sun seriously does affect you afterwards!  Just walking from the place to my car and I could feel my legs start burning from the sun exposure.  Most importantly - the laser treatments really work!  After my 3rd treatment I started to notice a significant decrease in hair.  And I could go a lot longer between days when I had to shave my legs.  The only thing to note is that when you buy a Groupon, it will typically include 6 treatments.  And for most people that's not enough.  I expect that I will need 8 treatments to have completely smooth legs.  And those treatments without a Groupon are pricey!  Even with their "special deal" they gave me, it still ended up being $200/session for the extra sessions I need.  *one "trick" I just thought of is that maybe you can buy a Groupon for the Scottsdale location and then buy a Groupon for the Biltmore location?  it might work... keep it in mind...  the only cons that I will note are that sometimes they are busy and running behind.  I've had to wait up to 40 min for my appt before.  also, sometimes the technicians are rushed, so it seems like they aren't as thorough with the laser as at other times.  for example, they are supposed to mark your leg into quadarants with chalk to help keep track of which sections have been lasered and which haven't.  well, sometimes when they are in a rush they don't bother to do that and I feel like they maybe miss spots.  oh and as for the pain, it's very little (at least for me).  on a scale of 1-10, most of the time it feels like a 1, but for some particular areas (like around the ankles) it can feel up to a 3.  but that does not last long.  I would recommend this place, esp. w/ a Groupon!  do it, you won't regret it.

Based off of food and atmosphere I was going to give this place three stars. I ordered the spicy brat (not actually spicy at all...) and garlic fries. While they were both decent, they were not worth the price they charged. If your restaurant is called BRAT Haus, you better have some better than average brats, which they don't.  The reason I gave this place two stars is because at the end of the meal the waitress brought out all our separate checks. One of my friends left a $10 bill to cover his meal and tucked it in with our credit cards, then he left because he had to go home. When the waitress came back with our credit cards, before she set the checks back down on the table, she says "oh and your friend who left didn't pay so I don't know how you want to figure out how to pay for him...." We were all confused because he is not the type of guy to do that and we asked "are you sure he didn't pay with cash?" and she replied "no, it looked like he hadn't even touched his check." Anyway, we all agreed we would cover his portion, but then when we opened our credit card holders we found his money that he had placed in there with his check. This was definitely just an honest mistake on her part --- BUT before you go accusing a customer of walking out on a check wouldn't you double check the credit card holders to look for his receipt?? And she never apologized when we pointed out his money had been there the whole time. It's just plain rude.

Two words - coffee crepe. what?!  I'm actually not a fan of either coffee OR crepes, but I liked the coffee crepe I ordered!  It came with very fatty and rich pork pieces.  They also brought out a tiny little appetizer of pork rinds before my crepe, that was cool.  I'm very glad we came RIGHT when it opened, because the line was already forming.  My friend and I also ordered the Nutella/banana crepe for dessert.  It was lovely.  It inspired both of us to go buy Nutella and bananas on our way home.  That is a combo that can't be beat!

Came here with a Groupon, not sure I would come back without another discount unless it was happy hour. Although the food was good, without the Groupon our bill would have been $45 and the friend who I dined with wasn't even totally full at the end of the meal.  The food:  -Truffle Edamame $4: warm, buttery, flavorful, good amount of food, but too salty  -Pork Gyoza Soup $6: overpriced for what you get, you get 4 dumplings which are supposedly filled with soup and pork. unfortunately, the way our dumplings were made they stuck to each other and the bottom of the plate so they ripped open when we picked them up and the "soup" spilled out. only 1 dumpling made it to my mouth intact and the soup was alright, nothing to write home about  -Ginger Mint Duck Salad $9: good value - you get a few slices of duck meat on top of a bed of shredded cabbage, the dressing was very good, tasted like a traditional Vietnamese salad -- I would come back to this place for that salad, but watch out for the spice. I like spicy and this had my mouth tingling for a little while after  -House Dynamite with Chicken $11: okay value, but they should serve it with rice or recommend that you order a side of rice when you place your order. rice is cheap so it's annoying that they skimp on this. the other reviews saying this dish is spicy are NOT true. I barely tasted any spice at all, even though the plate was covered in red pepper flakes, they weren't hot. I liked the assortment of veggies, including baby corn, that they used in this dish  -Mango Monkey Martini $11: yuck. I'm not a big alcohol drinker and this was way too strong for my taste and sort of reminded me of medicine. my friend thought it was okay, but also really strong. I don't think ginger and mango are the right flavors to mix together.  service: great and friendly, came on a Wednesday ngiht at 7 PM so the place only had two other tables than us, not a long wait for food at all, the cucumber infused water is a nice touch.

I'm so glad to have a fun neighborhood spot to go to for brunch! We came here on Saturday morning. We must have arrived with a big wave of people, because there were about 8 people in line waiting to order food in front of us. (FYI - this was rare, the rest of the time we were there, there wasn't more than 3 or 4 people waiting in line) We didn't mind waiting because we got time to look over the menu and look around at the decor. The restaurant has a really nice atmosphere - modern, yet rustic? The only thing that concerned me was that when you wait in line you stand at a shoulder-height counter overlooking the kitchen and there was no protective glass shield. I felt like a misplaced sneeze could've contaminated all the food being prepped on the line!  Our food came out in exactly 20 minutes. For having 8 orders in front of us, I thought that was good time. The portions were generous. I ordered the BMOC and had to take half of my pork chop home (...but I am a girl and I don't eat that much). The food was pretty awesome. The pork chop was tender, the apple sauce (kind of like apple pie filling) they drizzled on top was sweet but not TOO sweet. My only gripe was that they placed the porkchop on top of my waffle and covered the whole thing in apple sauce so my waffle wasn't as crispy as I would've liked. if I ordered it again I would ask for the waffle on the side, maybe on a separate plate.  My friend ordered the Banging Pocket, which he loved. I tried a bite and it was really good! What put it over the top was the salsa that came in a little side cup. I've had many salsas before but there was something really special about this stuff! Very flavorful, kind of tasted like they used roasted tomatoes or something because it had a very deep and rich flavor. He did not have any leftovers to take home.  With all of the interesting choices on the menu, we could come back here several times and not get bored. I also love that you can bring your dog on their outside patio :)  Edited to add that the service was very friendly. When we walked in they explained to us how it works (order food at counter, food served at your table) and everyone else was also helpful too.

decent venue to see small bands. they have a nice foosball table and pool table and a good seating area if you don't want to stand to watch the bands perform. my only complaint was that my vodka/cranberry tasted like it was made with kool aid instead of cranberry juice.

this restaurant is in a really nice little shopping center with all white stucco-style buildings.  I ordered the mushroom swiss burger (sans the Swiss) and the Superfood side salad (sans goat cheese)   the burger was typical.  I liked the mushrooms.  I ordered it medium, but it came out more like a medium rare.  I didn't mind that much since I usually get my steaks medium rare, but I know others who would not like that.  I did not expect the salad to be in such a thick creamy dressing, but it was pretty tasty.  I really liked the addition of the cranberries and avocado.  the turnips on the salad were pretty flavorless but they added a nice crunch.  the salad even held up pretty well (bc it's kale) so I was able to eat my leftovers for lunch the next day.  I liked that the parking lot had plenty of spaces available to make parking a breeze.  and the servers and bus boys were very attentive.  they must have refilled our water glasses like 4+ times!

I came here to grab an appetizer with friends.  It's like a sports bar, but with nice decor.  There are TV screens everywhere, but not so loud that you couldn't hold a conversation with your friends.  I ordered the chips and trio appetizer (salsa, queso, and guacamole).  No complaints about anything.  The cheese was good and gooey with a bit of sharpness.  The guac was nothing to write home about, but decent and fresh.  The salsa was the best out of all 3!  I tried a part of my friend's shrimp tempura appetizer and dipped it into a Thai chili sauce.  Yummm that chili sauce was delicious!  Sweet, spicy, and tangy.  For Tempe Marketplace, this is definitely one of my more favorite restaurants to eat at.

This place is great!  I love their pizza selection - a lot of new and interesting combinations (one of my dining companions noted that their pizzas are too weird) but if you like that kind of thing, then this is your place!  I got the brussel sprout pizza that came with pancetta, and it was so good!  My only complaint is that the crust was a little too large and took up too much of the pizza.  I also got the half TLC salad that had mixed greens and beets.  Yum, I love beets and always enjoy having them in a salad!  I also appreciate that they take reservations for lunch.  Servers were very friendly and although the parking lot is small we had no trouble finding a space at lunch. All in all, a great experience!

You can get tacos and enchiladas customized how you like it - sort of similar to Chipotle in that you're ordering at a cafeteria-type line.  I ordered two tacos and selected short ribs for one and mushroom/spinach for the other.  I also saw they have a mashed potatoes filling that looked pretty yummy, I might have to get that next time!  You can also pick from a variety of salsas, and something different from Chipotle is that they also offer a cabbage slaw and picked onions on top.  I tried the slaw, just bc I like eating as many veggies as possible, and it was a nice addition!  I would love to come here again, although come at around 11:30 for lunch bc after that the parking lot and the line become a big pain!

Everyone who has reviewed this place already wrote really good descriptions of the shaved ice, so I won't repeat that. I'll just say that I like the variety they have for flavors of shaved ice and for toppings. I had the Thai tea shaved ice with red beans and lychee jelly toppings, glazed with condensed milk. I kind of want to go back to get the same thing because it was so good, but I also want to branch out and try other things. #firstworldproblems. In addition to the shaved ice they also serve boba drinks.  I'm happy to see this place having so much popularity in its first week. I hope the success continues!

Tried green tea snoh with black sesame glaze this time around. A few of my other friends also ordered the green tea snoh. General consensus was that the flavor was very mild, almost non-existent. It was good when you ate it with toppings, but without the toppings it was pretty much flavor-less. Probably won't try that flavor again!

The Tasting Room gets 5 stars because the employees were really helpful and accommodating when we came in with a party of about 12 and there weren't tables available close to each other.  They rearranged their setup and helped us pull two tables together.  They also split all our checks with no hassle. Great service and I will be back!  Oh FYI they take reservations -- which I will be making next time I come with a big group.

Yumm-o! This is my new favorite Mediterranean takeout place!  For $7.95 you can order a Bowl that comes with saffron rice, 1 veggie, 1 protein, 1 hummus, and unlimited toppings (such as cabbage, bell peppers, cucumbers, chick peas, beets, olives, and much more that I don't remember).  It's a LOT of food, and I had enough leftovers for a snack later.  Upon taking the first bite of my bowl I let out a "Mmmm!" bc it was so tasty, seasoned nicely, and flavorful.  My only mistake was in getting cilantro jalapeno hummus AND cilantro jalapeno sauce.  Their jalapeno hummus is actually SPICY -- not like at other places I've been to before.   So while it tasted delicious, my mouth was burning and my nose was running towards the end of the meal!  Good thing they include a pita with the bowl, so that helped cool my burning tongue :P  Plus, the people here are so nice and friendly and seem genuinely excited about the food they serve, which is awesome.  We'll definitely be back!  Probably next week.  I tried to take a pic, but the yelp app kept freezing :( boo

still really liking this place! and I recently learned that their vegetarian "bowl" option is great. usually with a bowl you get 1 meat, 1 veggie, 1 hummus, 1 salad.  with the vegetarian option you get 2 veggies, 2 salads, and 2 hummus!  I ordered that last night and it was delicious.  the broccoli is my favorite.  it's one of those places where you can eat vegetarian and not feel deprived afterwards or hungry again 1 hour later....

What a unique gem of a restaurant!  I love that this place serves foods and drinks that are totally out of the norm for the Phoenix area.  I had never had Scandinavian food prior to this (unless you count the IKEA cafeteria? which, no, you probably don't count that) and I was excited to try something new.  Being new to this cuisine, I decided to try the Scandinavian sampler plate for $20 so I could get a little taste of everything.  It comes with 3 meats, 1 side, and 3 salads.  I liked the cured salmon, but it was a little strange to have it just by itself since it was so salty. I felt it needed some bland potatoes or bread to balance it out.  The meatballs were my favorite meat.  The plate also came with gnocchi, which was my favorite part of the meal!  Comfort food at its best.  My least favorite part of the meal was the beet salad.  From the pictures in the menu I thought the beet salad would just be big chunks of beets with a sprinkling of cheese.  What came out was little chunks of beets mixed in with a cream (maybe mayo?).  I don't really care for mayo and the "salad" ended up being hot pink, which I know is due to the beet color but was just a little off-putting for my tastes.  My dining companion got the elk stew, which I tried a bite of.  It was really yummy and filling.  His dish also came with a tomato salad that was incredibly good!  I don't know where they get their tomatoes, but they are so flavorful and not like the lame bland tomatoes you get at the grocery store.  I will definitely be back again to try out some new dishes AND to try their desserts -- which looked HUGE and yummy.

I'm not sure what Moar O. is talking about. Their waffle is NOT standard stuff you could get at any hotel. I had two friends visit me from out of town, so I took them here. They loved the waffle and bacon so much that they insisted we come back again two days later. What I like to do is go here with someone who likes to share. One person orders the special for the day (usually an omelet of some sort with side of home fries) and I order the waffle and bacon and we split them both. Otherwise, if you eat the waffle by yourself, you will die (or just feel really sick because of all the butter and syrupy deliciousness).  Also, servers and other staff are always VERY friendly. Waiting is a drag, but it's to be expected so you just deal with it.

Tip: They have HH menu here EVERY day from 3:30-6:30!  That's amazing to have HH on the weekends.  Some of the HH deals weren't that great (like only $1 off edamame) but other deals were really good (like $4 off calamari appetizer).  We actually didn't end up ordering off the HH menu and just ordered sashimi salad.  It was $15 but came with a LOT of fish on it, so I felt it was a pretty good value.  It was definitely filling enough for me.  I enjoyed the greens that it was served on and the light salad dressing.  I would order that again!

If you are looking for an intimate and romantic Italian night out, this is your place!  We came on a Saturday night and they had live music - a lady playing cover songs on acoustic guitar.  While it was a little awkward towards the end of the night (bc the restaurant was pretty much empty and there were only 2 tables left) it was still nice to hear her play.  We came here with a voucher deal for a price-fixe menu, so we got to share an appetizer, pick two entrees, and share a dessert.  (it also came with after dinner shots but we skipped those...).  For our appetizer we ordered the "simple salad" which was exactly what it sounded like.  Basically just greens, carrots, and croutons in a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  I enjoyed it.  For my entree I ordered the shrimp scampi.  It came with thick, flat noodles in an orange-colored cream sauce.  It was slightly spicy, but not overpowering.  I really liked the dish, but I would have liked it more if my noodles had been cooked just a BIT longer.  They were slightly hard and not cooked enough.  I still finished almost the whole dish.  Dessert was their special for the night, a turtle cheesecake.  It was moist, thick, creamy.  Just what you'd want and expect in a cheesecake!  My biggest gripe is that their menu needs better descriptions of the entrees.  Most of the entrees just have the Italian name, with very little detail.  For example, "Chicken Ciambotta" is listed under "pasta" but it's actually a type of stew and it comes out with NO pasta in it.  I had to google most of the names of the entrees to try and figure out what they were.  I understand I could ask our server, but I would've had to ask him for like 10 different descriptions, and I didn't feel like doing that.

Came to Salut with two girlfriends for brunch.  We ordered a few dishes to share.  The quinoa pancakes were interesting.  I'm not a fan of quinoa typically, but I enjoyed these pancakes.  They were fluffy yet filling.  The farmhouse omelette was typical, what'd you want and expect in an omelette.  The potatoes served on the side were not my favorite.  The potato was cut up into suuuper tiny chunks that was difficult to eat.  I would have preferred bigger pieces.  The chicken and waffles was good also.  I loved the waffle!  I don't know if chicken + waffle is my favorite pairing though.  Definitely a large portion and extremely filling.  We came at around 10:15 and the patio was pretty empty.  However, when we were leaving around 11:30 it was filled up quite a bit.

I tried the green tea shaved ice with red beans and mango toppings.  The green tea flavor was actually better than Snoh's (the other shaved ice place on Camelback) because the flavor was stronger.  However, the red bean topping was a little weird and the tables in the food court were kinda dirty.  Still a great place to get a refreshing treat in Mesa though!

Came here for lunch on a weekday because I was working nearby at the Biltmore Resort.  I ordered the breakfast tacos on flour tortillas.  It was really tasty.  I was surprised that they offered a creamy aioli type sauce on the side instead of salsa, since it was tacos, but the sauce turned out to be a good addition to the tacos.  The amount of food was just right for me, which means that most other people would need to order a side or something to feel full.  The food is excellent, but I could do without the loud club music playing over the speakers at noon on a Thursday....

Go here! and bring your friends! this place is amazingly fun. I've been to Vegas a few times, but I just recently discovered this place on my most recent visit.  When you walk in you are greeted with a much-appreciated whoosh of cold air and the smell of apples (strange, but true, everyone commented on the apple scent).  Inside there are random areas for seating, including a big bed and several huge lovesac bean bag chairs.  Outside there are more seating areas with comfy patio furniture to sit on and watch your friends play giant Jenga or giant beer pong or cornhole.  There is a counter where you can check out board games to play including Operation, Lasers, and Cards Against Humanity.  My only issue is that no one is stationed at the counter and you are supposed to ask your server to bring you a game, but we could never track down a server.... we just ordered drinks from the bar.  They had a live band there that started playing outside at 10 pm.  While I usually love live music, it was a little too loud to still comfortably talk to friends.

I am impressed! I came here on the recommendation of a friend, not knowing anything about the place and I ended up loving it. The decor is cute and modern and clean, although I can see this place getting packed because it is a small restaurant and I think it will get very popular soon.  I ordered the postafino (?) panini for lunch.  I love that it came with a small side salad with balsalmic dressing and big parmesan shavings.  Simple, lightly-dressed salads are my favorite! The panini itself was HUGE -- honestly, it's SO big.  Inside the panini was the perfect amount of melted cheese, arugula, and prosciutto.  For only $10, that panini is a great deal.  The other half of mine will be my dinner tonight.  Another plus is the olive oil and herbs/spices they bring out to dip your bread into.  They also have a spicy olive oil which is amazing.  I sprinkled some inside my panini and it gave it just the slightest kick.  I will most definitely be back, this place rocks!

thank you Lindsey and LGO! I am a dessert-lover so this was an AWESOME event for me. my newly discovered favorites from LGO are their tres leches and their peach gelato! I also rediscovered my old favorite: the old-timer cupcake (the one that looks like a huge Hostess chocolate cake) -- literally the best cupcake I've ever eaten!  I thought the proposal was so sweet (no pun intended) and I apologize to Mark and Heather for talking through your proposal, I didn't realize what was happening until people started clapping! I hope someone caught that on camera because that was definitely a moment to remember.

I caught this food truck when they were outside the Four Peaks Tasting Room.  I like that they offer a 1/2 pizza and 1/2 salad combo -- because sometimes you need vegetables!  The salad was great.  I ordered it with the sweet mustard vinaigrette and thought it was excellent.  The greens were fresh and I liked the sliced pickled jalapenos on top.  It came with a LOT of jalapenos, so I saved a few of those to eat on top of my pizza, delicious.  I really liked my pizza!  I'm not usually a fan of thin crusts, but this one was alright.  I still would've preferred a thicker crust.  The baked potato toppings were so good.   The only con of this place is that if you are pretty hungry to very hungry, one pizza will probably not fill you up.  My boyfriend ordered the pepperoni and mushroom piiza -- but he had to go home and eat more food afterward bc he was still hungry!  So you are looking at about a $20/person bill if you really want to feel full afterwards.

I wanted to like this place so badly, and I was actually thinking of giving it a second chance before writing this review. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I do not want to come here again.  First of all, I've never eaten Taiwanese food before and I didn't really know what to order off their very extensive menu.  The first waitress couldn't help us bc she didn't speak English.  The second waitress was just generally unhlepful in making recommendations or explaining what the different dishes were.  We ended up ordered a squid and vegetable dish and a kung pao chicken dish.  They took SOOOOO long to come out!  After 20 minutes of waiting we find out that there is a problem with the rice cooker sothat's why everything is taking so long.  Finally, after 30+ minutes the squid dish comes out.  The "vegetables" in the dish were JUST cabbage.  And the squid was just the frozen, pre-cut kind that you can buy at the store.  The kung pao chicken was slightly better and in a very flavorful, savory sauce.  But the rice was still soggy when it came out, even though it took 45 minutes for us to get it.  so yeah, I wanted to like this place and I always root for independent small business owners, but this place was just not good enough to warrant a second visit.

I came here with a group of ten for their Novem-beer event.  I was nicely impressed with their customer service.  Our table on the patio was all set up when we arrived.  And they surrounded the area with heaters, so even though it was a cold and drizzly day, everyone felt pretty comfortable.  The Novem-beer event itself was fun, a good value for what you paid because you got to sample a lot of drinks.  Plus, they were supposed to punch your card every time you got a sample, but lots of times they didn't punch my card, so if I had wanted to, I could've gotten way more than ten samples (but I didn't.... I'm a light weight).  The service got slower when it got really packed, but we were fine with waiting since we were there to hang out and chat anyway.  Like the other Vig location, their food doesn't super impress me, but it's good enough to come back again.

Best sushi I've ever eaten in Phoenix!  I came here for lunch today with a friend.  At first we were a little confused by the set up because we were expecting a traditional sit down restaraunt.  At this place you either pick up a pre-packaged sushi combo or you order at the counter (at least that's how it works for lunch).  I chose their Sushi Combo A for $10.  It was a great value and came with 2 tuna and 4 salmon and a california roll.  One thing you will notice right away is that their rice is PURPLE!  Unique and interesting, although it really just tasted like regular rice to me.  They have an explanation for why the rice is purple showing on their TV monitor, but I didn't take the time to read it...  For the fish - the quality was EXCELLENT.  The tuna was a deep dark red and very moist.  The salmon was fatty, buttery goodness.  For the service - everyone was very nice.  The owner is very hands on and checks in to make sure you are enjoying everything.  He even delivered a flaming roll to one table, which was quite the show!  I will 100% be back here again.  Can I come back tonight??  The only con - no parking lot.  You will have to find a metered spot on the street, but there are a ton of them right nearby so it's not a huge inconvenience.

After writing my first review I came back for dinner the very next day (yes that's how much I loved it!).  Dinner service was pretty busy, and at times we saw that people had to wait for tables.  But they do take reservations, so keep that in mind.  My party of 3 ordered the Omakase for 2 people, seaweed salad, and stuffed jalapenos.  We loved everything!  The Omakase was awesome, and it wasn't like at other sushi restaurants where they fill their chef's choice plate with cheap rolls or imitation crab and stuff.  Every piece on the chef's choice plate had fish in it and every piece was delicious!  Can't say enough good things about this place, you just have to try it for yourself...

This is probably more appropriate for a "TIP" but I couldn't figure out how to write one on my desktop.  Anyway, I saw a sign that they are no longer going to serve lunch bento boxes and that it will just be the full service menu at lunch.  Also, they now offer daily specials!  When I went, they had a blue fin tuna special.

So -- I still haven't had the pizza here.  I guess I'm just not a pizza person. But the more I think about it, I think it IS fair to judge them on their non-pizza food, because even if it isn't their specialty, if it's on their menu it should taste good!  I came here again for lunch this time and ordered their salad that comes with pesto and dressing on top.  It was the saltiest thing I have ever eaten!!  The pesto had too much salt, the dressing had too much salt, it also had cheese on it, and when all those things combined it was basically just SALT.  my mouth had that funny burning feeling after I ate because of all the salt.  Whoever taste-tested and approved this menu item has got terrible tastebuds.  Also, my friend ordered a salad but they brought her out a totally different salad.  And since we were there on a lunch break she didn't have time for them to make the right salad for her... strange and not cool.  I hope this place does well because it's nice to have a business on that corner instead of an empty lot, but they seriously need to revisit some of their menu items and strive for GOOD, not mediocrity.

I only tried a chocolate milkshake here, so I can't vouch for the food.  But I liked the shake!  It came in a mason jar with whipped cream and a cherry on top.  The shake itself was really thick and creamy.  The decor is trendy and classy and the theme is creative - each of their dishes is named after a infamous gangster.  The bar has this brewing/tap room enclosed in glass walls with a cool chandelier that's a pretty neat decorating touch.

Teeeeny tiny bar!  Full of quirky touches like a fun chalkboard wall where you can leave your own artwork.  Also lots of games available like Operation, Cards Against Humanity, etc.  Located in the same center as TexAZ.

I have been a fan of Chick-fil-A since I was a kid.  I loved their kids' meals that came with books and toys.  Their food is still as good as I remember.  And you have to try the lemonade!  This place gets 5 stars because they gave my dog treats when she rode through the drive-thru with me :)  Plus the drive-thru is convenient although they have a small lot.

These are my favorite donuts in Phoenix, which is not saying much bc I think all donuts in Phoenix are pretty bad (compared to the ones you could get back home).  But if you are craving a sugary treat, this is a great place to stop by and grab a dozen for the road!  I always get the Boston cremes, yum.  This location isn't as great as the other Bosa locations bc there is no drive thru!!  But there is ample parking in their lot so that's okay....

My dining companion ordered the 2-lb dungeness crab.  Pretty pricey at $34, but that's what's expected when eating seafood in the middle of the desert. I would say the crab was worth that $30, it was delicious and the meat was sweet. It was kind of strange that the server didn't automatically bring out tools to open the crab with, not sure if she expected us to just use hands?  She eventually brought us out the claw-breaker tool, but I wish they also had those plastic tools you can use to cut the shell open.  I ordered the crawfish.  It was pretty good, although there were 3-4 crawfish in my bunch that were "bad" that I couldn't eat.  I wish they would've weeded those ones out.  Overall, I would come back again, since there are very few places in Phoenix to go to for good fresh seafood.  oh, and I have to add that I really liked the oysters they served, they were quite large! and very tasty.  I also like that they have the hand-washing station outside of the bathroom since you know everyone's going to get really dirty hands when eating this seafood.

Fancy decor and Vietnamese cuisine don't often happen in the same sentence, but this place is a fabulously decorated Vietnamese restaurant!  They have this cool lighted tree branch sculpture/chandelier that was really mesmerizing.  The restaurant itself was not that large and somewhat narrow.  But it's still able to fit a lot of people, we came with a large group of 20+ people!  I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered the clay pot rice with veggies and tofu to share with my friend.  It came with soup and salad, and we were able to order extra soup and salad for $3 so each of us could have some.  The salad and soup were tasty, although the soup less impressive than the salad and the soup kind of had too many chives in it.  The clay pot rice was great!  I loved how the clay pot made some of the rice hard and chewy at the bottom of the pot.  The tofu and veggies were also good.  My favorite part was the mushrooms, I wish they had added more of those!  Overall great experience and I would come again, but I will note that I wish they had better ventilation.  With all of the steamy dishes being cooked in the kitchen, the place was getting smoky and hazy inside.  And when I went home my hair and clothes all smelled of food.

My friend and I shared the watermelon pizza, jalapeno poppers, and the nachos.  The watermelon pizza was by far our favorite thing we ordered, even though it was so simple!  It was just watermelon topped with "jalapeno nectar" (I think agave syrup or honey or something), pistachios, and basil.  Although for $6, I might just try to recreate it at home.  The jalapeno poppers were not my favorite.  I know that vegan cheese can't taste like real cheese, but the texture on this "cheese" was too watery for me.  The nachos were pretty good.  I liked that the portion was HUGE (definitely share these) and that they put some inventive stuff on top - like shredded beets!  The flavor was a little lacking for me, especially in the beans.  I think it needed some salsa or hot sauce to spice it up.  We also both ordered juices.  I got the "beet it" juice and thought it was good and refreshing.  Not too bitter even though there was no added sugar.  Overall, love the decor and ambiance of this place.  The food is unusual and an adventure to try new things, so I'd definitely be back!

Refreshing creamy delicious cold treats are the specialty here, perfect for the warm Phoenix weather! I came in for the first time today. There was no one in line in front of us and the guy behind the counter took the time to explain the menu to us and offer us samples of the Italian ice and soft serve. We ended up ordering the joelatti, which was layers of soft serve and Italian ice.  Man what a great combo! The ice is refreshing and tangy and the soft serve is SUPER creamy and thick. I've never had soft serve this good before.  On top of the delicious desserts, the decor inside is quirky and fun. Lots of vintage memorabilia like old gas pumps, old timey fans, etc. Plus the whole place was super clean, which I always appreciate. I'm sure this place will become a regular spot for me to visit to satisfy my sweet tooth!

I'm a fan of this place!  If only it were slightly closer to my work, I would be eating here a lot more often.  I've been here twice with co-workers for lunch during the workday.  It can get crowded, so if you have a larger group, I suggest showing up before noon.  They have a great lunch special that offers a small salad and two tacos of your choice for $10 (or is it $9?).  I've gotten that each time I've visited and have not been disappointed!  What's good/dangerous about this place is that they also serve delicious chips and salsa while you wait for your food.  Fortunately, I have a decent amount of self control, so I don't go crazy on the chips and salsa -- but the salsa really is great!  The decor is eclectic, colorful, funky, definitely a very joyful feel when you walk in!  They have a small parking lot, but if you come at peak lunch time it might be full.

I came here for a spring training game and it was rained out even though the rain had stopped and the sun was shining!  Apparently that made it "unplayable" conditions, boo Cubs, stop being such babies!  Anyway, at least everyone got a rain check on their ticket.  I can't rate the parking, since I took the free shuttle from Tempe Marketplace.  I have to say, that was a pretty convenient option.  We had tickets in the reserved upper deck for a corporate party and the food was pretty decent.  They served one of the best brownies I've ever had!  Burgers and hot dogs were the standard stuff.  But overall this place gets 4 stars since it's cool that Cubs fans have this place to watch games at.

My friend ordered bottle service here for his birthday.  I'm not sure how much he spent on it, but I felt that it wasn't worth it.  The place was soooo crowded that it was difficult for them to find us our own designated space.  And even when we did get a tiny alcove, it was super cramped and our group couldn't really stand together and hang out.  On top of that, the bar is an "outdoor" bar so there were smokers galore blowing smoke in our faces :( bleccchhhh.  We requested to move to a different spot because of the smokers, and I will give credit to the bar bc they were happy to oblige.  EXCEPT when we moved, our new spot had even MORE smokers!  After choking on that rotten air for about 30 min I was done and ready to head home.

Although I really liked the Cajun restaurant that used to be at this location, I'm REALLY happy Grassroots has opened up in its place!  They totally redid the decor (it's much better now with an open layout and fancy Southern furnishings - kind of what I'd imagine Paula Deen's house would look like :P).  Let's start with the appetizers.  The bruschetta with burratta and tomato jam was my favorite.  That burratta was the creamiest cheese I've ever eaten.  I try to avoid dairy for dietary reasons, but that stuff was so good, I couldn't stop sneaking bites of it.  We also tried the asparagus wrapped with bacon.  I don't know what they did to the asparagus, it was prepared very simply, but somehow so full of flavor!  We also sampled the shrimp/ahi tuna dip on top of chips. I really enjoyed the combo of fish and jalapeno.  We were fighting each other for the last chunks of tuna on the plate.  For my entree I ordered the BBQ brisket that came with jalapeno cheddar grits and beans and pickles.  Grits have never been my thing, but these were really tasty!  Dense and hearty and creamy with just the right amount of bite from the jalapenos.  The brisket was great, so tender I could cut it with my fork.  I appreciate that they didn't smother the plate in BBQ sauce.  The owner was so nice, he brought out an extra plate of grits for my friends to try, since not everyone'se entree came with them and he told us everyone HAD to try a bite!  Judging from my friends' reactions, everyone else also really enjoyed their food.  My friend who is a vegetarian ESPECIALLY enjoyed their veggie offering of a farmer's vegetable plate.  It came with a wide variety of veggies and it was much appreciated since at most restaurants she's just limited to salads.  Lastly, dessert.  I tried a little of everyone's desserts and they were all great!  I think my fave was the coconut creme pie, the crust was so delicious.  Someone at our table also ordered the banana splti sundae and that thing was HUGE.  The toffee brownie was also so rich and tasty.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!   I hope to be back soon!

Still think the food here is great! But I'm updating to note that I would not recommend this restaurant for groups larger than 8.  Most (if not all) of the tables in the dining area are bolted to the floor, so it's not possible to push tables together to accomodate a big group.  The best they can do is seat you at the two high-top tables next to each other -- but there is a big clunky pole in between the tables which makes interaction between the two tables really difficult.  It's possible they could accomodate a big group on the patio, but they did not have misters on that day and there was no way I was sitting out in that heat! :P

The crawfish here lives up to the hype!  The waitress warned us that their spice level is one level hotter than other places.  I don't know if I'd agree with that.  I ordered the medium spice level (which I usually order at other places) and it was about as hot as expected.  Definitely not too hot.  What I really liked about their crawfish was that they were HUGE.  the crawfish were so big that we even decided to crack open their claws bc there was actually meat in there too.  What did not meet my expectations was the oysters.  We ordered a half dozen of the raw oysters and they just weren't tasty.  The flavor was weak and tasted watered down for some reason.  The only way to salvage the oysters was to pile on horseradish and cocktail sauce, which was a shame.  I usually love to eat oysters raw with nothing else to take away from the great oyster flavor.  I also tried a pound of the green mussels.  They were good, but not great.  I was disappointed that in my bag of about 15 mussels there were 4 empty shells.  Also they were slightly overcooked and ended up being a bit more rubbery than I would have liked.  Overall, I would still come here again, but I'd stick to the crawfish!

How did I not know boba was so close to me?!  So happy I found this place to satisfy my boba cravings without having to drive out to Mesa.  I ordered a milk tea with honey boba.  The boba was awesome!  Chewy and soft, just like it should be.  The only thing is that it was pretty sweet, so next time I might ask them if they offer the option of "half sweet" like they do at other drink places.  I also saw on their wall that they offer a "blend" smoothie drink where you can pick 3 different flavors of smoothie all in 1 drink.  Interesting concept!  I might have to try that during the hot summer months!  Also something good to note is that all their milk teas are dairy free except for the Thai tea!

I tried their food at the Asian Festival in Scottsdale this past weekend.  For $10 I got spicy pork, rice, bean sprouts, and kim chi.  Pretty good value considering the price and quality of the other festival food that was offered.  I really enjoyed the texture and flavor of the pork.  I don't think I've ever visited the restaurant, but now I would like to.  Especially now that I see that their menu offers a spicy tofu soup, I love that stuff!

The bruschetta here is of course amazing, just like all the other Postino locations.  The restaurant here is quite large, with a lot of indoor and outdoor seating.  I like that the patio is dog-friendly!  Sitting outside and people watching is a great way to pass the time.  The only drawback is finding parking in the area, as this place does not have its own dedicated lot or valet.  You just have to drive around looking for street/metered parking.

I have passed this place many times on my way to and from work, and recently decided to stop in to pick up dinner.  I tried a salad and I got a hummus bowl for my boyfriend.  We both agreed the portions were pretty big.  However, next time I will probably just get a hummus bowl, bc the hummus bowl comes with salad in it, it just has extra stuff too!  I forgot all of what the choices of extras you could add to your bowl, but I remember there were lots of veggies, which I liked.  For all of the other reviews who said service wasn't that great, I would disagree.  The girl serving me my food was really friendly and took her time explaining things to me.  She also had me try their PB sauce, which was interesting bc it was vegan but it tasted really creamy.  I liked it!  Especially since I can't eat dairy.  I wouldn't say the flavors were out of this world, but I like that it's a healthy quick option for food, that is really convenient to where I live.  I will be back!

**Oops I guess this location is closed, but they reopened it at a different spot in Mesa across from Mekong Plaza. that's the location I wrote this review for**  You know you're in Mesa when someone leaves their horse trailer in the parking lot with horses inside so they can go shopping!  This place is HUGE and has a TON of furniture/hardware/scrap materials for sale.  If you are looking for clothes, it has none.  It has a few household wares, but not many.  The stand out items here were the light fixtures.  They were all priced at about $20, which if you've ever shopped for new light fixtures, you know they usually range in the $100.00 to $6 BILLION price range (ok I'm exaggerating, but light fixtures are seriously a lot more expensive than you'd think).  Other standouts were a solid wood hutch and cabinet for $150.  They also have nails, tiles, bricks, garden fertilizer, bathroom vanities, you name it for sale on one side of the store.  Unfortunately for me, I was looking for a cheap nightstand for the guest bedroom and didn't find one.  They had a few for $40, but they were way too 80's and ugly.  I'll be back when I'm doing home improvements.

Whoop I think I found a new favorite lunch spot to stick in my rotation for eating out! My friend and I got a table right near the big glass window and it was lovely sitting there and enjoying a meal with all the sunlight.  I had the sandwich with prosciutto and baby spinach.  Simple, but delicious!  Great quality prosciutto.  It came with a side salad, which was also simple, but done right.  My friend ordered the lentil soup, which she loved.  It was served with a side of bread.  She also got the cauliflower and mushroom "small bite."  I tasted a bit and can vouch that it was yummy.  Cauliflower cooked just right so that it wasn't too raw and wasn't too cooked.  Tip: show up early for lunch (like 11:30) because it can and will get packed and there aren't a bunch of tables inside so if there's no space you'll be outta luck and will have to get to-go.   also the parking lot is TEENY TINY. The parking situation stressed me out bc it's a tiny lot that you can't turn around in, so I had to reverse onto the busy street of McDowell, which was not fun at all.  also it wasn't clear to me if the lot directly adjacent was for the restaurant or for another business.  to me it looked like there were only 2 dedicated spots for this restaurant.  it would be helpful if they made that clear with signs or something if you can park in the other spots.  next time, I won't even bother parking in the lot and will just park in the neighborhoods across McDowell and cross at the light on 22nd St.

I ordered a plate of their food at the vegetarian festival this past weekend.  Their food was an excellent value, for $5 I got a plate of rice and lentils, lentil donut, chickpeas in sauce, potato thing(?) and dessert. I enjoyed the rice and lentils, had a creamy and nice texture.  The lentil donut was not my favorite, bc it was kind of flavorless and had a pretty tough texture.  It tasted better when I dipped it in the sauce the chickpeas came in.  What was most notable to me was the DESSERT.  I wish I knew the name of it!  I have had Indian food many times in my life, but I have never ever had an Indian dessert that I liked.  I really liked the dessert they served!   It was an orange cake/pudding type dish.  It looked like cake, but it was very very very moist, almost like a pudding.  It tasted slightly gingery and was just really delicious.  I would like to try their food at their restaurant some day.

I ordered the steak salad and was not impressed.  The salad was pretty small and had a bit too much dressing on it.  The steak meat was poor quality, chewy, and flavorless.  For $14 I expected better.  My friend's dinners did not look that impressive either.  The pizzas seemed regular, as did the sushi rolls.  Also, not really our server's fault, but they did not have enough servers on the floor on a Friday night.  so our server was really busy and we were really hungry but had to wait about 15 minutes to place our food orders.  we kept looking for our server to get her attention so we could place our order, but she was either nowhere to be found or occupied with another table and didn't glance over at us as she just went back into the kitchen.

Came here with a group of friends.  We each ordered a different dish and shared, which was great because it meant I got to try a lot of different dishes!  My favorites were the... oh no I forgot the name, but it was N8.  It was two different types of noodles, stir fried with egg, bean sprout, shrimp.  Basically like Pad Thai, but in a less sweet sauce.  I also liked the Laksa (I know I'm not spelling this right) although my friend ordered his super hot, and we still didn't think it was that spicy!  I recommend to order it with the rice noodles, because they are thinner than the regular noodles... and I just like it better that way for some reason.  I also ordered the seafood/noodle dish, which was N9.  It was good and the flavor reminded me of a Vietnamese soup dish.  I liked the veggie they used in the dish too, although I wish there had been more because they were really good.  My less favorite dishes were the ones with fried chicken.  They just didn't taste extremely special or have anything notable about them.  I would skip those next time.  I also note that all the eggs came out were overcooked (you can tell bc they had the gray ring around the yolk).  The eggs did not taste that good to me and were a bit rubbery bc of being overcooked.  I hope they work on not cooking the eggs as long in the future.  One thing to note is that our food didn't all come out at the same time.  This wasn't too bad because we all ate family style and shared everything.  But if you are with the type of people who won't eat until EVERYONE has their food... well, then your food is going to get cold waiting for everyone's food to come out.  A big plus is that I didn't see anything on the menu over $8, so definitely very affordable!  This seems to be a family-owned restaurant, as there was a little boy there riding his tricycle around the dining room and also at one point walking around without pants on (haha!).  I like to support local businesses, so I will probably be back here at some point.

This place is right on my way to work, so I decided to pick up a dozen donuts for my coworkers.  I also just wanted to try this place out since it is new.  I conveniently found parking right outside the entrance, which was nice.  There was a big banner outside advertising buy 1 dozen and get 1/2 dozen free, but when I walked in the lady at the counter told me the special was buy a dozen for $6.99 (regularly costs like $8.50).  No biggie to me, I ordered a dozen.  I tried just the plain glazed and I liked it!  I still prefer another donut shop (bc their dough is a bit lighter and not so heavy), but I would definitely come here again.  Especially if they continue to offer specials!  I would like to try their croissant breakfast sandwiches and their boba some time!

I tried their classic pommes frites with southwest mayo this past weekend at the vegetarian festival.  The fries were the big fat slices of potato kind of fries, that's the kind I like!  It came sprinkled with nice chunks of salt.  The southwest mayo really wasn't spicy at all, so I would have preferred more of a kick.  As for price, $6.75 was a little steep for one basket of fries, but we enjoyed the warm food on a cold overcast morning, so I can't complain too much.

A great place to pick up a fun whimsical treat!  I don't think I've eaten cotton candy for YEARS, maybe DECADES and this treat brought back a bit of nostalgia for me.  I tried the Lychee flavor, which was fruity and unique.  I love how they have so many unusual flavors.  I've got a few friends who are cotton candy fiends and I definitely envision myself picking up some more of these for them as special treats!  I didn't even know their cotton candy is organic, that's a nice plus!

whomp whomp. ordered chips & salsa and other appetizers to-go over the phone for a game night I was hosting. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  So 20 minutes later, I came to pick it up and was told by a server that she would check on my food. she never came back to even tell me if the food was ready or not. I could see food in a to-go bag on the counter that looked like it could be my food.  I waited 10+ minutes and just left.  they never called to follow up so obviously they don't care too much.  The reason I'm giving two stars is because I have ordered to-go on other occasions and gotten (slightly) better service.

I had the good fortune to try this place at a Yelp event.  and I liked it so much I came back again on my own!  The first time I went, I tried one of their signature salads, that came with little orange slices and grapes in it.  It was great and lots of interesting flavors.  The second time I visited, I made my own salad.  I liked being able to choose from so many healthy options like tomatoes, strawberries, apple slices, beets, mushrooms -- and so many more!    My only tiny gripe is that the scoop sizes they use for the ingredients is a little odd and you end up with strange proportions of things.  For example, when I chose mushrooms as a topping, the scoop was pretty small so I didn't get that many mushrooms.  But when I chose beets as a topping, the scoop was about twice the size of the mushroom scoop, so I got a TON of beet chunks on my salad.  I love beets, but it might have even been a little bit too many beets... I ended up not eating a lot of them.  So I just wish there was more equality and proportion in the topping servings.  I also love their unique selection of sodas!  I don't usually drink soda, but I like trying all the interesting ones they serve here.  I do have to note that the service here has always been stellar.  The employees are super friendly, and the place is kept very very clean.  I agree with other reviewers' comments that the price is a bit higher than probably what you would want to pay ($10+ for a large salad and $9 for a regular salad).  But you have to keep in mind that they use a lot of locally sourced products and I believe it's all organic... but don't quote me on that.  Plus, I ordered a large salad last night and although it looked kind of small in the takeout container, it ended up being more than I could eat on my own!

I'm in love with the soup/salad combo from here!  First off, they offer a lot of soups each day.  When I visited there were 4 soups on the menu.  Also, a big bonus is that they had indicators for which soups were vegetarian and which were dairy-free.  All the soups were dairy-free, which was amazing for someone lactose intolerant like me!!  I got the split pea kale soup in my combo.  It was sooo good and flavorful.  Really thick and hearty too.  Plus it came with a free side of pita that made it super filling.  For my salad portion I got the curry chicken salad.  It actually was not my favorite because it had too much chicken and not enough lettuce.  However, if you're looking for a big dose of protein, this salad would be perfect for you!  It especially tasted awesome with a dash of Mad spice on top :)  Next time I think I'd pick their Mad Greens side salad because it came with a lot of greens and different veggies.  Of course I also had to order an iced tea -- they have the best flavors there!  some are sweetened with honey, some with Stevia, and some unsweetened.  So no matter what your preference, they should have something you're looking for.  Another thing to love is that they're frequently offering coupons or discounts or BOGO specials.  Gotta love that!

I've been here twice in the past week, so you know the food has to be pretty good!  First time I went, I got the steak burrito dinner.  It came with a burrito, rice, and beans for about $9.  Not a bad deal... except when you realize that the burrito alone is only about $6... and the rice and beans they serve in the "dinner" are not that great-tasting.  The rice especially was not my favorite.  So second time I went, I just ordered the al pastor burrito alone.  Out of the two meats I tried, I think I prefer the steak to the pork.  I really like the "smokey spicy" salsa in their salsa bar.  It's not that hot, but it adds nice flavor to the burritos.  I overheard them saying that they got their recipes from Mexico City, so I guess they're pretty authentic to true "street" tacos!  This place is great, although I'll try to limit my visits in the future since the food isn't really all THAT healthy for you :P

I debated between giving this place 3 stars and 4 stars, let's say it's a 3.7.  What it has going for it -- atmosphere is really hip, trendy, and gentrified in an area that isn't really any of those things.  Similar vibe to Postino and the Yard.  It's a sprawling complex of a restaurant that is  unusual for the area.  The food is also good!  I ordered the spinach salad with salmon and the fruit salad.  The fruit salad was good, but a little on the high end price wise for what you got.  The spinach salad was good and filling and it was enough food that I couldn't even finish.  I liked that although it was drenched in dressing, the dressing was so light that it wasn't overwhelming.  Also, the salad had hard boiled eggs in it that were cooked just perfectly.  Not overdone and not underdone.  That's kind of a tough feat for hard boiled eggs, so I liked that.  However, I would have liked it better if instead of just doing spinach, they would have done mixed greens that included spinach.  Eating all that spinach gets a little monotonous after a while.  What I didn't like was that on a Sunday it was very busy and kind of hard to get quick service.  We sat at the bar and felt like we were waiting a lot (to order... to get the bill... you get it).  Also, our server/bartender was a little too jokey.  I don't need every answer to one of my questions to be a joke, you can just... answer my questions.

I came here during HH so I could try a lot of different appetizers.  I ordered the shumai dumplings, Lao style lettuce cups, and calamari.  I thought everything was great!  The lettuce cups came with a LOT of chicken.  I think it was enough for about 4 people to share that appetizer.  My friend got the spicy wontons, shrimp skewers, and vegetable dumplings.  I tried those and they were also good!  But the spicy wontons weren't noticeably spicy at all.  I like that they take online reservations, even for Saturdays.  I'll definitely be back here again!

I like the new location, it looks great inside and has lots of space!  Also some nice patio space.  But the lack of parking is a real pain in my rear.  If they have any parking, it's hard to find because I didn't see a parking lot or any parking spaces.  We had to park in the metered parking about a block away.  Not a huge inconvenience, but enough to make it less appealing than other restaurants.  The food was great, as usual.  I ordered my usual broiled chicken salad.  My dining companion got the spicy chicken wrap, which was a LOT larger than he was expecting.  One thing that has always annoyed me is that when you order their hummus appetizers you basically HAVE to order an extra pita, or you won't be able to eat all the hummus.  Why can't they just give you enough pita in the first place and factor that into the price of the appetizer... I just hate that feeling of being nickel and dimed.

Yay for custom personal size pizzas!  The concept here is like Subway meets pizza.  You pick the sauce, the cheese(s), the meat(s), the veggie(s) and they bake it up for you in less than 10 min.  Due to getting people in and out quickly, the pizza is a thin crust, which makes sense.  However, I love me a thicker doughy crust so for that reason I can't give their pizza 5/5 stars.  Still, I love the concept here and it's fun to pick all the unlimited toppings I want.   They also offer the same concept but for a build your own salad.  And they have pizza cookies w/ icecream, called "pookies" for only $3!  On my pizza I got red sauce, no cheese, spicy sausage, a spicy sliced meat, mushrooms, spinach, jalapenos, black olives, tomatoes, garlic and fresh basil.  Yum!  The garlic and the fresh basil added an amazing touch.  I'd definitely come here again, and maybe even with a big group because they've got a nice large dining area.

Vegans/vegetarians rejoice!  Loving Hut is here in Tempe.  The restaurant itself is super small, seats maybe 9 people inside?  I would only order to-go from here.  I tried the Saigon Rolls appetizer.  The rolls were bigger and fatter than the typical non-vegan Spring rolls you get from Vietnamese restaurants.  The "shrimp" was made from sea-plants and tasted pretty much just like shrimp to me!  I liked their peanut dipping sauce a lot. The only thing is that I would def share that appetizer, because eating 2 of those big rolls on your own is too much and at the end the shrimp started tasting weird to me.  Also I didn't care too much for the pickled carrots inside, I think I would have preferred just regular carrots!  For my meal I got the Spicy Noodle Soup that came with tofu, fake "beef", potatoes, bean sprouts, and noodles.  I loved the flavor of this soup, very spicy and warming on a cold day!  I didn't much care for the tofu, but the fake beef was really yummy!  The potatoes seemed a bit undercooked to me.  It was a lot of food though, that one order turned into 2 meals for me!  For dessert I tried the chocolate cake.  I really wanted to try pandan cake, but they were all sold out!  The chocolate cake I would pass on next time.  It was pretty dry and not quite as fudgy or rich as I would have liked.  The nice thing was it wasn't "too sweet" so if you have less of a sweet tooth, you might enjoy it more.

This place is really fun!  It's tucked away in a little strip center(?) (I don't know what you call it) that doesn't look like it would contain an icecream shop, so you have to keep sharp eyes out to spot it.  For non-dairy eaters like me they have a surprising amount of options!  The day I went they had 5 dairy-free sorbets that were so delicious.  I ended up getting half passionberry and half strawberry moscato, yum!  The coconut macaron on top was sooo sweet, but in a good way.  I liked how the outside of the macaron was crispy and the inside was a bit gooey.  The torched marshmallow on top put this dessert over the top!  There is little more that I love in this world than toasted marshmallow.  I'll definitely be back for more sweet treats!

I have been waiting and waiting for the Phoenix area to get a Bambu!  I love the dessert drinks at this place.  My favorite is the #1 Bambu Special that has longan, green jelly, basil seed, coconut meat, and coconut water.  It's super refreshing and kinda has some health benefits too on top of being delicious (basil seed is very good for you).  My very picky boyfriend who doesn't typically like Vietnamese dessert even liked this drink.  Thanks so much for bringing this place to Chandler!
