How can you go wrong with a fast food pizza place that is just an assembly line of orders?  After a long weekend I didn't want to cook and it was too late to go get some food so I ordered a pizza.  I figured, it's 10:30pm and I just wanted to eat something so I ordered from Papa Johns.  When I received the confirmation e-mail it said that it was going to arrive in 30 minutes!  Needless to say I just wanted a slice since I was super hungry.  It was getting so late on a Saturday night that I almost fell asleep.  This pizza didn't show up until 12:15am!!!  Seriously? An 1:45 minutes for a pizza that is less than one mile from my place. I was so hungry at this point I almost didn't care that it took so long.  But nobody called to say it was going to be late and the pizza showed up ice cold! There is no way I was going to reheat a pizza that just showed up at my door.  It was obviously cooked right when I ordered it and just sat there for over an hour before it was delivered.  This is the last time I will ever put a tip on my order when I place it online! Terrible service and an ice cold pizza!  No explination.  No sorry for the long wait.  Never again!  Does anyone have the number for Pizza Hut?

I discovered TruCab and have been a fan ever since.  I live in Old Town and use their $5 anywhere in Old Town cab ride a couple times a week!  The great price was the reason I started using TruCab; their continued professionalism is the reason I still use them today.    Not only are their cabs clean, but their drivers are very nice and fun to chat with.  When I call they know who I am and where to pick me up.  The consistency of service is the reason I recommend them to everyone I know.    I will use TruCab every time i need a ride! Thanks guys!
