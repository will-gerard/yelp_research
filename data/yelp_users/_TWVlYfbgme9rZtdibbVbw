This is the best sushi in Phoenix.  The rolls are a little different than traditional rolls, but that is what makes them so good.  I love the Lion King Roll and the Spicy Tuna Poppers.

Went a few days ago with my family. I would give the food 3 stars, but it was the service that was amazing, 5 stars. Our server Phil was one of the best servers I have had. Very friendly, gave great suggestions on food, and kept the glasses full.  Great service!  As for the food, it was good. We got the shrimp sampler which was good. My wife and I also shared a ribeye and shrimp. The ribeye was ok but I have had better. My daughter ordered the corn dog and I thought it was really weird that it cam with cole slaw. Odd side for a kids plate.

This is THE BEST place to get authentic Mexican style street tacos.  The tacos Al Pastor are amazing.  There are many other restaurants in the valley that are nicer and have good mexican food.  There is no place that has a better street taco.  Totally worth sitting outside when it is 100+ degrees.

I would not sign up for Direct TV again if they were the only service provider on the planet.  I had an issue with my HOA and tried for weeks to get it resolved through DirectTV.  I was lied to and mislead from every Customer Service Rep I spoke to.  No one knew what they were taking about or knew the policies of the company.  Always pointing the finger to someone else that can help me fix the problem.  Don't waste your time or money with this company.
