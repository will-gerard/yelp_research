-No FUNKY second-hand clothing smells here! The stuff looked pretty new too, surprisingly.  -Prices were pretty decent, although I didn't find anything.  -Merchandise was easy to look through, not too crowded at all.  -I saw several people coming in the store with arm loads of clothing from their closet, so this must be a pretty good place for your unwanted duds.  -Parking was convenient.  -Next door to "Well-Suited" Men's clothing.  -This is what a multi-million dollar revenue retail business looks like (per newspaper article 11/14/10). Impressive.

-Limited selection of stuff. (the building looks so HUGE on the outside, but ONLY a small area is used for the Thrift Store).   -Most of the few things they have is crap from the 80's and '90's, so I guess it belongs in a thrift store...if you like that kind of stuff.  -No funky smells, probably because there isn't a ton of misc stuff to create one huge thrift store aroma.  -If you want to see the employees FREAK OUT, just wander into their break room by mistake, since it looks like part of the Thrift Store. The old "dears" will scold you like you are a little kid.  -Prices...um, ok, I guess. Seems like there were many older ladies browsing through the clothing racks.  -The (older ladies) store employees watch you like you are going to steal (or wander into their break room).  -Parking is convenient.  -Not a Thrift Store that I would go out of my way to stop at again, I've been here 4 times and never found anything good to purchase.

-Wait in line to order your food, the Hostess will seat you, and someone will bring your food to your table.  -Friendly service.  -Parking sometimes sucks, depending when you go.  -BUSY, busy, busy...they claim they will find you a table, while you wait in line to order...but, what if the table hogs who are DONE EATING continue chatting for hours and NEVER leave and there are no tables available???  -The restrooms are unisex. The toilets are individual restrooms and the day I went they smelled like urine, pee-pee men's restrooms. GROSS! Usually the restrooms smell clean...  -YUMMY pizzas! Baked in a fire brick oven.  -Yummy salads! Perfect portions! $9+.   -Italia sandwich is a bit weird...what is that sweet vinegar jelly on the bread? Too gourmet for my liking!  -Sandwiches come with a side of your choice.  -Ambiance is like eating in a trendy warehouse.  -I like Liberty Market!

-Healthy Habits is like a concentrated version of Sprouts (smaller version crammed into a small shop). Before Sprouts came along, this is where you had to shop for the healthy stuff.  -Healthy Habits reminds me of a little NYC grocery store, small and every nook and cranny filled to the rim with products.  -Smells good when you walk in, like lavender, chamomile, and other natural herbal stuff. I felt like I took a shower just by walking through the store.  -Rows and rows of vitamins and other natural suppliments, protein powders, and some food items.  -Prices were pretty decent.  -They have a pretty good selection of books (natural remedies, natural living, etc)...well marked too.  -Dr. Bob Martin (kfyi radio) talks about this place every Saturday am.  -Employees seemed helpful.  -Parking is convenient (spots are kind of tight and close together in case you are concerned about car dings, etc).

-Lots of food, feed, and supplies for your standard farm animals, plus food & supplies for cats, dogs, and pet birds.  -Excellent equine selection.  -Cute, adorable baby chickies for purchase and to cuddle.  -Reasonable prices.  -Clean restroom (from handling the chickies or after consuming a Starbucks Venti beverage).  -Plentiful parking.  -Friendly employees.  -Open 7 days a week.

-This place SHOULD be CLOSED for many reasons, but it's still OPEN for business.  -The decor and merchandise looks cheap and low quality.  -The service is CRAP! Why is there ONLY 1 cashier in K-Mart?   -Prices seem higher than T & W.  -The (other) cashier in the Garden dept put my merchandise on the dirty counter BEHIND him instead of just placing it in the plastic Kmart bag after ringing up...what a douche!  -Half of the parking lot was unpaved with pot holes and gravel...WTH? Was I in a rural area?  -Before Target & Wal-Mart, there was K-Mart (remember ICEES & blue-light specials?)...next time you want to complain about Wal-Mart, visit your local K-mart store and you'll appreciate Wal-Mart even more!

-Conveniently located next to Trader Joe's.  -Purchase food or janatorial items in bulk...like a teeny fraction size of Costco.  -Clean store.  -Service...not so great. :(   -Each time I have stopped in here, there is one cashier and 4-5+ customers in line (like Hobby Lobby).  -Most prices are not so reasonable to lure me back.  -Observed two employees chatting in the aisle, instead of opening another register to expedite customer check-out.  -After deciding NOT to wait in the long one-cashier line, I left my "potential purchases" near the register. Instead of opening another register to assist with checking out customers, another employee wasted no time scooping up my abondoned items.  -I'm surprised that this business is still open. You get a vibe that the employees hate their job and that management is terrible.

It's very easy to spend a lot of money at Trader Joe's, because they offer so many unique & diverse food items for reasonable prices.  -Service is friendly and helpful.  -Fresh flowers and herb plants available.  -Parking is plentiful, although depends on the time of day and week, it can be busy.  -Restrooms available through the double doors near the produce.  -Usually, there are food/beverage samples to try new items or meal ideas.   -Located on Bell Road (behind Taco Bell) in front of Arrowhead Towne Center Mall.

Two Sales Associates busy chatting about the texting on their phone, as I was trying to inquire about a shoe size. I should had gone to get my own shoes from the back, why bother having employees when they are too busy making chit-chat instead if helping customers?  Two more sales people chatting upstairs, instead of helping customers. Next time, I'm going to stand next to chatty employees and look at them while they chat.  I'm sure there are plenty of unemployed people out there that would be grateful to have the job of these sales employees that are too busy chatting instead of assisting shoppers.

-WORST check-out! LONG lines and ONLY ONE cashier working...I think I passed by at least 5-6 employees stocking the store shelves.   -The check-out here is almost WORSE than Hobby Lobby!  -The MOD (mgr on duty) is not helpful either. Does this person even work here? So clueless about any general questions when I asked.  -PARKING is terrible! This Michael's is sandwiched in between a Target and a Starbucks, lots of cars whizzing by and not stopping at the STOP sign, duh! Dodge the cars at your own risk!  -Messy Michael's, one of the messier ones that I have been to. The Store Manager obviously doesn't care, because it shows with poor service and a messy store in such disarray. Sad. :(

-An acceptable chain restaurant to take "out-of-town" visitors for (overpriced) sit down Mexican food with tacky decor.  -Expensive! Almost $11 bucks for a carne asada burrito???? Really?? For that price, I could had bought like 2 or 3 burritos at any "...Berto's" type place in the Valley!  -Refried beans are bland and thick like drywall putty.  -$1.98 for a small side of guac OR sour cream with your meal.  -Salsa not as good as it used to be...tastes like chunky watered down tomato soup with added preservatives (mostly ala sodium benzoate) . You'll be consuming a tin of altoids afterwards from "salsa breath".  -Loud background music. I shouldn't have to talk super loud over the blaring music, was I in a nightclub or restaurant?  -Service was ok. Servers seem to scowl when you request MORE chips & salsa.  -Parking is plentiful.  -Separate entrance in the back for take-out.

-Very dirty and filthy Target. Why is this Target neglected of cleanliness?  -Inconsistent service. Some employees are friendly and others are rude jerks (like the heavy-set twenty-something rude gal standing near the front of the store laughing at other customers. I saw and heard YOU! Very unprofessional.)  -Never enough registers open. Just let me pay and leave please!   -Messy aisles. Lack of employees to straighten or maybe they don't care?  -Shopping carts? Where are they? All over the parking lot. Lots and lots of them everywhere!  -I don't expect any service at Wal-Mart, but lately it's looking like an upgrade from Target, especially this location. Skip this location and travel further to the Super Target on Cotton Lane if you need your Target fix.

-TWO STARS is for the MOST overpriced Goodwill store I have EVER been in! Even more overpriced than Savers! More overpriced than an ANTIQUE store! Seriously!  -The person or people pricing stuff here must be smoking bananas or something...it's a Thrift Store!   -Smaller store than the average GW store. Clean.   -Parking is so-so.  -Lots of old folks here, since it is next to Sun City...so, be warned that you will be dodging lots of shopping carts (in a very small store) that many (older) customers are clinging onto like an assisted walking device...and they expect YOU to move out of THEIR way!  -Employees were not as friendly (or as bright) as I have seen at other GW stores.

--we were seated right away.  --service was not very good, waitress took too long before taking order and dropping off check.  --food took too long to arrive and hamburgers were cold.  --food was average, a bit overpriced.  --parking was crowded (maybe due to baseball games).

-Friendly, helpful staff...they seem like they enjoy working there.  -Good prices on coffee $5.99 for the Breakfast Blend. Tasty coffee.  -Lots of coffee, novelty candy, & wines. Also they have a 1/2 aisle of mini food items, and stuff to make a food gift basket.  -Unique housewares stuff, small furniture pieces, bathroom decor things, etc...decent affordable prices.  -Did I mention the friendly staff? They greeted me and thanked me...very helpful too. This kind of good retail service is becoming a rarity these days.  -Convenient parking...a few shops over from Old Navy.

-WOW!! I didn't expect over the top, friendly service in here...I REALLY like this Baskin-Robbins!  -FRIENDLY, helpful, attentive, enthusiastic (I am speculating was the owner)...a guy that enjoyed what he was doing and really likes his customers! The kind of service that keeps you coming back...  -SUPER CLEAN! Bright & cheery B-R decor...makes you happy about having ice cream.  -LOVe their ice cream...just give me all 31 flavors as I head over to Weight Watchers...  -Convenient parking (next to Leo's Island BBQ).

-PARKING: like others have said...park in the street for FREE. Don't get ripped off paying $10 in a parking garage. There were a few empty spots along Washintgton.  -SEATS: Made for midgets or pre-school sized kids. If you are average size and are claustrophobic , you WILL be UNCOMFORTABLE. Forget about crossing your legs...NO ROOM. Way worse than airplane seats in coach!  -RESTROOMS: Ten stalls in the Ladies restroom on the west side of the building for hundreds of women = SUPER LONG LINE. Were there more restrooms somewhere else in the building?   -THEATRE: HUGE inside. Two jumbo TV screens (not the best quality). Friendly & helpful employees. Played good pre-show tunes. Started show 20 minutes late. Did I mention HOW SMALL the seats were?   Would I see another show here...not really.

-Friendly and helpful staff. The cashier even suggested a cool add-on product near the register.  -A diverse and large selection of art supplies not found at the big box chain stores. They had art supply items I didn't even know existed!  -Good pricing. Student discount available. I'm still an art student!  -Plentiful parking. Located in the same shopping center with Goodwill on the corner of Indian School and 16th Street.

-Open Wed-Sat. 10am-5pm.  -SUPER cute Romantic Shabby Chic shop with a Scrapbook store attached to it.  -The owners and employees are very friendly and helpful.  -I LOVE the home decor stuff they have, some Rachel Ashwell textiles/fabrics, etc. Plus, painted white furniture pieces (which were kind of pricey).   -Cute Scrapbook merchandise, very Shabby and Vintage. Nice little rubber stamp section too.  -Cute Shabby Chic baby accessories and decor.  -Overall, this store is decorated very well.  -Parking is out front and has never been a problem.

-A cool place to shop for antiques in the Phoenix area!  -Really big place full of lots and lots of antiques and other treasures! It takes hours to get through the entire place!  -Most of the prices are very reasonable, I have found some of the best deals here! Some stuff is higher-priced.  -A few booths dedicated to Vintage Military collectibles, Victorian decor, and aisles of cases filled with all sorts of pyrex dishware, old books, dolls, and tons more stuff.  -There are several rows with cases and the rest of the store are dealer booths.  -LOTS of locked cases with nice jewelry pieces.  -I LOVE coming here, I ALWAYS find something unexpected and usually at a really good deal.  -Cool oldies music playing in the background.  -Clean restrooms.  -Lots of convenient parking.   -Great hours, open all of the time, from 9am until 9 at night.   -Located right off I-17.

-The owner (man) was VERY friendly.  -Some Chinese Woman (the owner's wife?)...NOT friendly! She gave me the impression that I was bothering her for coming in to eat there! There were like 3 or 4 other tables in the whole place.  -The Food: Not so great...the chicken was mostly small almost chopped chicken chunks...dry too, maybe from overcooking?  -Flavor: Ick! I didn't care for the food, thought it was bland.  -Beef dish, not much beef...mostly veggies vs the meat ratio...$8.95. Not a good value.  -I said "thank-you", as I left...the Chinese Woman looked at me and said nothing, then she walked away....nice!  -Parking is convenient.  -With the un-friendly Chinese Woman and not so great food, there are many other Chinese restaurants that I would select over Wongs.

-Looks like a fast-food tex-mex place, but it is a casual sit-down, full service restaurant. They even had margaritas for $2.  -REALLY good food, BIG portions! $9.95 for a Carne Asada plate loaded with guac, rice, and beans. Not super cheap like a 'Bertos, but decent prices.  -FAST & friendly service! The food was brought out by the time we started digging into the chips and salsa...like SUPER fast!  -Chips & Salsa were delicious with the wonderful taste of fresh ingredients. They also have extra "burn your mouth" spicy upon request.  -Clean restrooms. Convenient parking.  -Located in a 1/2 dead strip mall, next to Peter Piper Pizza on the west side of the Metrocenter Mall.  -I would eat here again for sure!

-Friendly employees. Needs check-out to be quicker.  -$3.00 hotdogs at the snack bar, which smelled really good.  -A few Shabby Chic booths.  -Way cool salvage yard on the outside with more stuff.  -During their Flea Market event, which covers half of the parking lot with NO parking. There are NO spots down the side streets, no spots behind the building. Be aware of this if you attend one.  -Most of the "antiques" were mostly recent collectibles, not so many antiques as I find at other places.  -There was a huge booth with all sorts of bead supplies.  -A diverse variety of primitive, shabby, collectibles, and a neat antique booth in the far back corner with victorian boots and millinery, stuff that looks like it should be in a museum.  -Clean restroom (only 2 stalls).  -Fairly large place.  -Parking spots are not made for cars larger than a compact vehicle.

-Nice essense of plant scent that lures you into the store (actually, just wanted to wash my hands in the store sink - too lazy to find a restroom).  -Store is located upstairs in Scottsdale Fashion Square above the food court area.  -(Very serious) Store employee offers you some hot tea to sample...  -$10.50 starting price for a bottle of shampoo...and this stuff really makes your hair feel CLEAN!!! And the scent leaves your bathroom smelling like a spa! No more crappy $2.50 bottles of shampoo for me!  -If you are a first time customer, they will ask you for your contact info to follow-up...um, it's shampoo, not a car. Really?  -They will ask you if you want a bag for your purchase (environmental save the earth stuff)...hmmm? Let's see, do I want to walk around the mall with a couple of random shampoo bottles in my pockets?  -They have a website you can order from too...some promos offer free shipping and a free sample over a certain amount ($35 or $40).

-Located in downtown Scottsdale.  -Mostly Rubber Art Stamps store, but also lots of cool things for Paper & Altered Art projects.  -A fantastic selection of Paper Arts magazines and books. Probably every Stampington publication is available.  -Decent prices with LOTS of unique items.  -TONS of inspiration samples.  -Parking is convenient.  -Owner is friendly and helpful.  -Clean little restroom.  -Closed on Sundays & Mondays, best to check their Blog for store hour updates.

-WEIRD antique store, like another Yelper posted - "it's more like a museum..."  -LOTS Taxidermy animal heads (including a "pink" earless elephant head, which made me sad), creepy mannequins, and lots of interesting old antiquities, not just vintage things like you see at other antique malls.  -Check out the back of the store - there is a "Last Supper" mannequin display (see my photo)...I was a little scared. Very CREEPY!  -They also do live auctions...probably on the finer, upper-end antiques.  -Very RUDE employees!!!! I won't get into details.  -I'm surprised that this place is still in business.  -OVERPRICED!  -Convient parking - next door to another antique mall (SKIP this place and go to the Antique Trove next door).

-Easy Online Classes that start every Monday, select to complete in 8 or 14 weeks.  -Helpful Advisor and No WAIT (unlike some of the other community colleges where you could wait 60-90 minutes to see an Advisor).  -Have textbooks shipped to you (or search Amazon to see if you find a cheaper copy).  -If you go to the campus, the parking is NO better than the other Maricopa campuses, this one offers a multi-level parking garage. Plan to park on the top level (which SUCKS if you don't like heights or it's triple-digit weather).  -A yummy cafe inside the campus (which is more like a mutli-level office building), food is SUPER CHEAP!  -Helpful customer service (everytime I called).  -I am very pleased with Rio Salado! I plan to take many of my courses from here!

**REVIEW UPDATE**   -First impressions can be rather deceiving...   -Took three online classes at Rio Salado...(Online Classes starting every Monday is appealing and convenient, but BUYER BEWARE).  -Two Instructors were ok.  -One VERY USELESS Instructor (no feedback to essay assignments, took over a week to grade assignment, no reply to emails, Lesson plans were not very clear, etc)....what a waste of money and time!!!   -Online classes are very textbook heavy and essay intensive, I didn't learn ANYTHING! (read this and write this...no critial thinking). If you just want your degree and don't care to learn anything along the way, then it'll probably be fine for you.  -If you are a right-brain learner, you'll probably dislike Rio's boring, dull  classes. If you are a left-brain learner, you'll probably LOVE it!  -Textbooks are made specific for Rio Salado.   -I dropped my courses Rio Salado for next semester and signed up with MCC online if that tells you anything.

-ANOTHER OVERPRICED Thrift Store...sigh!  -Most stuff was just JUNK..and it was overpriced.  -Furniture was WAY overpriced! I've bought NEW stuff cheaper at Target!  -Store was not super big, but it looked organized. Lots of clothing. Lots of (OVERPRICED) furniture.  -Located on the West side of the street. There is a Goodwill located just down the street (south).  -There were two shopping carts outside the front door full of bread. Was it for sale? Was it FREE? Was it for the birds hanging around nearby? There was no sign and I wasn't going to bother asking.  -Parking was convenient.

-This Thrift Store is so-so...  -Aside from the cool, reto interior leftover from the sixties, this place has LOTS of clothing, and mostly junk.  -Big store, but smells like a giant dirty laundry hamper. Organized. Friendly employee greeted me as I walked in.  -Right next to a .99 cent only store, which explains the super busy parking lot and homeless dude???  -BEWARE: The parking is awful too! Very tight spaces and hard to find a spot. People drive like jerks and just pull right out without looking...

I used to like shopping here. I don't like the NEW JCPENNY, it's confusing shopping in their store. Not a fan of the new style and merchandising.   I can't even tell the employees from other customers, they are dressed so casual, I don't remember seeing a name tag to at least know that they work there.

-I adore Fashion History, but the impression that this merchant conveys is unorganized and uninviting.   -Handwritten signs around the store: "No restrooms - don't ask", "don't steal", "don't comment about our fur pile", "our books are NOT for sale, just for looking ONLY"...etc.  -Messy piles of clothing EVERYWHERE! Many items lacked price tags.  -Prices were a bit high.  -Visually unappealing store...Dusty, hat boxes (were they for sale or for display? No NFS signs or tags) Piles of clothing on the furniture, on the counter, everywhere! It was too much!   -If you seek Vintage duds, then you may want to visit Antique Sugar in the Melrose area (Central Phoenix), mostly because it is better organized, visually appealing, and not overwhelming, I am more inclined to make a purchase.  -Parking was along the street.

-Locked cases are to the front of the store. More vintage booths towards the back of the store.  -This place has some new modern furniture.  -There is an upstairs area, but I'm too lazy to check it out.  -Prices are hit or miss.   -Not my favorite antique shop, but a decent one worth visiting when I'm in the area.  -Parking is to the east of the building.

-$450 for a used dresser?? I can buy a NEW one at Ashley Furniture for less!  -$250 for a white particle board bookshelf in terrible condition??  -Who is pricing this stuff? Someone who watches too much Storage Wars??  -This "thrift store" is not "thrifty", it is way overpriced. :(

-MESSY, messy, and did I say "messy"?  -Dirty store. Gross restroom!  -The cashier was condescending. When I asked for paper to wrap my ceramic vase in...rather than just randomly placing it into the plastic Ross bag, she made a "disgusted" face at me, like I was asking her for one of her kidneys or something.  -The security guard dude with the amish goatee beard was on a total power trip - he was scolding people for forming one line (like at most other Ross Stores)...he kept REPEATING (like everyone was hearing impaired) to just get BEHIND anyone in any register line...(maybe he used to work for the TSA???)  -The shelves were 1/2 empty...like it needed to be restocked.  -Maybe the ONLY thing that was good (two-stars) was that there were four cashiers....but, it was soooo busy, they could had easily used more cashiers. (I thought we were in a BAD economy??)

-Fantastic fresh Dim Sum! (even during weekday lunch)  -Decent prices....  -Nice decor - typical fancy chinese restaurant decor.  -Clean restroom.  -Service - friendly, esp for a Chinese restaurant. Although, the chinese cashier guy didn't seem very friendly, the food servers and ladies pushing the dim sum carts were friendly and attentive.  -Most of the customers were Asian, which is a good sign of food authenticity...ya know you made a good choice!  -Ordered turnip cakes and chinese broccoli off the menu, since they weren't on any of the carts.  -Very convenient parking...plenty of spots.  -The food is so good, it's worth the MSG headache!

-Parking was semi-convenient (lot was almost full during peak lunch hour).  -Outside and inside seating.   -Inside seating was LOUD from all the various conversations within the small restaurant.  -Place your order at the counter, they give you a number table tent, and bring your food to you.  -Sandwich was REALLY good! Side salad of mixed greens was the BEST I have ever had! Justified the price ($8.25).  -Order took maybe 20 minutes to receive (not good if you have a certain amount of time for lunch).  -Chocolate Macaron was delicious! I would had ordered more to-go, but at $2.95 each, this could get expensive.   -Clean restroom.  -I would eat here again!

-CLOSED Mondays.  -Overpriced stuff....furniture or home decor that I have seen at Antique Shops for LESS!  -Very small and mostly filled with junk (I know it's all donated).  -Halo is located in the same strip center with some antique shops and a consignment shop.   -Sadly, I stopped coming into Halo whenever I am in the area.  -Stinky restroom...smells like urine, pee-pee men's restroom.  -Staff sometimes acknowledges you.  -Convenient parking.

-Store sign falls on a customer with the Store Manager and his two giggling minions just a few feet away. They continue chatting and laughing. Very professional, huh?  -The incident is pointed out to the Store Manager and he shrugs it off. Why is this guy a Store Manager I wonder????  -During a previous visit, there was obvious tension between TWO MOD (manager on duty). I speculate that they think they are invisible or that customers don't notice this ongoing drama at this location.  -My point is that the store manager sets the tone to the store environment {ie - neat store, friendly employees, service, etc.} and this one needs a NEW Store Manager. There are many other grocery store choices, I wouldn't bother stopping here again regardless of the prices, location, etc.

-WOW! These are the friendliest folks I have ever met! The store owners were very cordial and friendly. They really have a passion for antiques.  -COOL 1930's building with original wood floor and peeled away plaster walls, revealing cool old bricks...how rare to see in Phoenix! Love the old vintage glass door.  -Neat products, decent prices...not a big store, but a one worth visiting for sure!  -Parking is convenient, on the side street.

-Chipolte is like the Subway of quick Mexican grill style food. Made to order burrito bowls(no tortillas), giant million calorie burritos, tacos (crunchy or soft), etc. Scoot down the line towards the register to pay and sit down to eat.  -They have grilled chicken, beef steak, barbacoa, and carnitas. White or brown rice. Bean choices are black or pinto. Select shredded romaine lettuce, jack cheese, sour cream, fajita veggies, and salsa choices. Guacamole is $1.95 extra. Extra meat is a few bucks! You can even order two kinds of meat for half & half style. Pile it on! Yum!  -If you have celiac disease, let them know and they have to change out the serving utensils in case anything comes in contact with a flour tortilla.   -Clean place. The line moved quickly during peak lunch time.  -Extra scoop of rice is available at no charge, just ask if you like rice. I like their rice!  -There is a glass shield between patrons and the food for a reason. Why do people think it's OK to reach their arms over the glass to point to the food or hang their arms over the glass within inches of the food? Knock it off, buddy!  -Employees were friendly.  -Plentiful parking.

-PARKING: plenty  -DECOR: what is with the BRIGHT fluorescent lights during dinner? Most places have softer lighting during dinner. Plus, it smelled like dirty carpets and felt like some kind of church hall meeting with the strange lighting.  -RESTROOM: Smelled like sewage and needed to be cleaned, like someone just had a toilet paper party in the ladies restroom.  -SERVICE: all of the employees that I encountered were friendly.  -PRICE: Not too bad for dinner, like $10 bucks and change.  -FOOD: Pretty good. The Chinese was not good, but all of the American "comfort" foods were pretty tasty. Decent selection.  -BEVERAGE: They give you your beverage when you pay and the waitress gives you refills. No access to coffee or your own refills. Reminds me of the Vegas buffets where you are at the mercy of the Food Server for refills.  ****Four Stars for good food and friendly service.

-Cute, retro classic style of clothing. Perfect for the curvy, full-figured gal!  -Pricey! Most dresses were $130-plus bucks.  -Service? I never see anyone working in the store when I wander in. I think they hide behind the curtain.  -Several 1940's style of shoes to accompany the classic apparel they offer.  -If items were more affordable here, I'd probably make many purchases.

-Food is decent, not the best Mexican food. It's about $7.75 for a 2-item combo during lunch, no rice or beans. Taco shell was dripping with grease and the meat was room temp. That's appetizing, right?  -The WORST waitress EVER!!!! We thought she was either drunk or on some sort of drugs! We tipped the bus boy instead. It was too late to ask for a different Food Server...we were stuck with her.   -Waitress told us she was going to clear off dishes at another table and will be back to take our order, even after we were sitting there waiting already for 10 minutes and told her we WERE ready to order....we saw her chatting with another table. Who does this?  -The Busboy acted more professional than the Food Server. She was "in-your-face" patronizing, rather a very "fake friendly", and acted like someone who had been drinking, it was really uncomfortable.  -Chips and salsa were good.  -Not a good value for the price/portion.  -Hostess was friendly.   -I would NEVER eat here again, esp since there are so many other choices for Mexican food in the Valley.

-Food: HUGE portions, very tasty, delicious, & fresh! Good prices.  -Tortas come with either a side salada or rippled-style potato chips.  -A small accompaniment of red and green salsa...muy caliente!  -Service was friendly, but slow (we had to hunt down the waitress to take our order)...they all wore yellow shirts and had a ponytail, so it made it a challenge when we had to ask for the check.  -We came in at 11am...but it was already very busy. We were still able to get a table, but they are very close to other tables...unless you want to sit in the lap of another person...  -Restroom is very clean.  -Pay your check with the cashier up front.  -Parking is not so convenient. The spots are very tiny, maybe meant for those Eurpean Smart cars. It's like a normal size parking spot that was split in two...is this to give the illusion of MORE parking spots? Someone parked so close to me, I thought I was going to have to climb into my car through the back window.

--Service was slow...no refills, never checked back, had to wait for check.  --pizza was pretty good. Crispy toppings.  --Parking was not too bad. Park around the corner.  --Too bad for the awful service here! Maybe they need to switch to placing your order at the counter with a cashier and get rid of the food servers.

-Service has improved a lot since my last visit.  -Greeted and thanked by Hostess.  -Pizza is still outstanding (order the Italian Stallion, it's the best!)  -Pizzas came out pretty quickly.  -Some tables are too close, do I need to be touching elbows with the stranger at the next table?  -Parking was convenient.

-TSA agents at Gate B @ McCarran Airport need training on how to use their common sense skills.  -The agents weren't rude, just really more like slow moving zombies with no individual thoughts or empowerment to make a common sense decision.  -Long line, two open lanes, most agents were standing around inspecting shampoo bottles and cosmetics and running bags to be rescanned.  -Why does a CLEAR ziplock bag containing CLEAR 3 fl oz bottles with CLEAR liquids need to be x-rayed two additional times? Maybe the agents think an explosive might magically appear with each scan?  -Why did my other randomly scattered in my-suitcase-and-handbag-liquids (lotion, hand sanitizer, nail polish, lip gloss, etc) go unnoticed?   -Isn't nail polish more flammable than a travel size stick of Degree deodorant, which by-the-way ended up being subjected to individual inspection and another trip through the scan machine?  -I don't remember reading about any Al-Quida groups terrorizing airplane passengers with travel-sized toiletries or unopened packs of moisturizer. Box cutters were used on 9/11 and explosives were used in other acts of terror, but these situations were defused (pun!) by other passengers and crew, not the TSA.  -Body Scan = Seen naked by a random TSA agent in some hidden airport room in addition to being exposed to a slight dose of radiation.  -Many of the TSA rules and policies make no sense, many which are inconsistant.   -Currently, folks over 75 yrs old can keep on their shoes and jacket, not folks who are 73 yrs or 74 yrs old, because they could be real trouble-makers I suppose.  -As for the 3fl oz liquid rule, isn't the human body mostly composed of liquids?   -Overall, the TSA is very inconsistant, no matter which airport or terminal you end up at  -Just show up early for your flight in case you end up being subjected to this unnecessary TSA monkey business.

-Organized inside. Smaller than other Goodwill stores.  -Filthy, dirty parking lot...small too. Rugged with pot holes. YIKES!  -Good prices. Friendly employees.  -It's hit or miss on what treasure you might find at this location.  -Park on the north or south side of the building - the entrance faces west. Handicap parking is on the north.  -I have been in this Goodwill many times and have NEVER found anything.

-UGH!! Poor quality, inconsistant bagels! Why are my bagels different thickness? I didn't order "thin bagels". When did Asiago Cheese become a "cheese pancake"???  -Cashier tells me that the "Asiago Cheese" has always been thin...(um, no they haven't!) This shouldn't had been served to customers.  -Saw the young high-school employee dude throw some bacon into the microwave...euw! No napkin, no plate, no wax paper...WTH?  -Slow service! Stuck behind an indecisive lady...ugh! C'mon lady chose a damn bagel and ice tea and move along!   -The cashier was a young (inexperienced) gal who had the IQ of a potato, it was obvious she didn't know how to work the register either...why bother having people like this handle money transactions????  -Parking is ok  -It was way too much of a hassle to run in to get a bagel here...poor food quality, terrible service, Inconsistant food quality, and inexperienced employees. :(  -Next time, I'll go into a Safeway to get a bagel...less hassle!  -WORST Einsteins that I have ever been to! Is this one a franchise???

-$3.99 basic drive-thru car wash (they have upgrades available).  -Today was a FREE car air freshener with upgraded car wash.  -FREE use of the car vacuum and FREE use of the floor mat cleaning machine.   -A good place to clean out all of the burger wrappers and dried up fries under the car seats.  -Entrance/Exit is on 35th Ave (quick right turn if heading south).  -Cash or credit card accepted at self-paying machine.  -Friendly employee (there is usually someone spraying soapy suds on your car as they direct you onto guided car wash track).  -I like that this place is self-service, offers complimentary car cleaning amenities, and is clean.

-This Sprouts has VERY friendly employees!  -$2.99 fresh sandwiches! Yippee!!! Fill out the slip, leave it on the counter (until the sandwich lady makes eye-contact with you that she saw it) and your sammie is made to order!  -Wait with the rest of the other hungry patrons, it gets pretty busy around lunch, everyone wants a $2.99 sandwich.... Just pay up front, the lines are shorter or empty than paying at the sandwich counter.  -This store seems much darker than other Sprouts, kinda like a cave.  -Clean restroom (two stalls in the ladies restroom).  -Convenient parking.  -I like this Sprouts!

-The BEST fries in the whole wide world!! Cheap too!  -I LOVE these hamburgers, it's worth waiting for! I envision the toasty buns, secret sauce, and greasy goodness as I slowly wait my turn in line.  -Good location, right off the freeway.  -Service was friendly, just like any location.  -I learned there's a Jersey Mike's in the same parking lot, as I waited in the Drive-Thru line.  -I found this location with YELP's help.

-Located in the corner of a strip mall...NOTE: BEWARE of a thousand car-ruining speed bumps throughout the strip mall parking lot....it was like driving over a curb every few feet!  -Sometimes, I find $5 furniture here. Other times I find junky overpriced furniture that should just be tossed into the landfill or furniture chipper.  -Prices are pretty reasonable.  -A decent balance of used clothing, books, and other used, unwanted stuff.  -Staff is pretty friendly.

-Revisted this store.  -Employee magically appeared from the back and just stood at the register. She said nothing at all, it very ackward and uncomfortable, so I left.   -During my previous visits, the owner was working at the time and made you feel welcomed, even when she was busy or sitting there.  -A decent selection of scrapbook stuff, not a huge amount.  -A wall of stamping supplies, diverse selection.  -Paint your own ceramics selection - looks fun!  -I wanted to like this place, but it's just ok.

-Front door greeter was nice and cordial, of course it happen to also be the Store Manager.  -Employee "Ryan" provided cold, robot-like service and was quite condescending too! If you get this guy, then ask for someone else, unless you like that! (IMO, Ryan would be better suited working as a TSA Gov't Worker.)  -Parking was convenient.  -Wait time not too bad.  -Located in the Target/Kohl's shopping center, near the car wash.  -My third visit to this store (whenever I'm in the area), the service is not impressive at this location.   -I always get matched up with a MEAN employee, while I observe the customer next to me being helped by a friendly employee! Inconsistant service. Avoid. :(

-Nice selection of Vintage duds.  -Some things seemed reasonable priced. Diverse selection of cool retro stuff. No FUNKY smells either.  -Cool little old house (circa 1930's or 1940's???) that is now a store...totally fun to walk through.  -Friendly service.  -Parking is ok, but a concern to back out into the busy street. Park in the back, by entering an alley off one of the side streets.

-Very cute clothing and jewelry boutique for the conscious fashionista.  -Friendly service & unique decor with bling & virgin mary statues.  -Next to and attached to Rust & Roses (Shabby Antique treasures).  -Prices are highly marked-up...for example, I bought a jewelry piece here and saw the SAME exact one at a suburban (Westcor) Mall for almost less than half of the price! ...And the one at the mall wasn't even on sale or clearance...(are they marking stuff up like 400%??? You'd think the stuff at the mall would be WAY more expensive!)  -Recap: Yes, the clothing is "high-end boutique", but if I wanted to spend $70 bucks on a blouse, I could probably buy LOTS of blouses at Ross or Marshall's...heck, I've even found bargains at Dillard's! As long as it covers my ta-ta's, it doesn't matter if it was $70 bucks or $7.99...  -Worth the visit to look...  -Parking was not too bad...park in front or on the side street.

The quality is way better than Taco Bell or McDonald's.  -Dipping sauces are surprisingly very good for being fast food.  -Love the cole slaw and the waffle fries!  -This is located in the Lowe's Shopping Center at the SW CORNER of Dysart & McDowell.

-Long, slow lines.   -Dirty, filthy restrooms (even for being new!)  -Not enough open registers (usually just 1 or 2).  -I'm done shopping here due to the neverending long lines and their lack of calling up back-up cashiers, even Wal*Mart is better organized than this!  -Do yourself a favor and get your craft supplies at Michaels instead.

-Small and cute antique shop with many "true" antiques and vintage treasures (not like how many of them are adding boutique crap).  -Looks like a little emporium or old style general store.   -A cute candy section.  -Upstairs is well-worth the visit.   -Decent prices.  -Right across the street from the VT Library.

-A nice, variety of Chinese food, plus some salad bar fixins, jello, desserts, and some American food.  -Seven buffet islands, plus the Sushi area = eight total areas of food to choose from.  -Clean restaurant. Pleasant decor.  -VERY friendly, coridial staff.  -Food was really good & fresh for a Chinese buffet. Tasty & delicious!  -Drinking water did not taste filtered (usually from the soda machine), it tasted like Phoenix tap.  -Convenient parking.  -The ladies restroom smelled like sewer (not like someone who just made a stinky in the stall, but the foul aroma of a sewage drain)...  -Despite the smelly restroom, I would definately eat here again!

-ALOHA!!! If you crave the creamy taste of authentic macaroni salad from Hawaii, look no further...yum, yum, yum!  -Kalua pork was tender, smokey, and moist...yum! yum! yum!  -Grilled BBQ chicken was tender and so good!...yum! yum! yum!  -The noodle soup was so good - $5.99 and the portions are very generous!  -Crispy shrimp was crispy, maybe panko breading? It was so good! Not greasy! Perfectly cooked. Must have more!  -They even have SPAM on the menu too (if you've been to Hawaii, then you know that SPAM is offered everywhere - even at McD's too!)  -Service - FRIENDLY, SUPER NICE, and very cordial.   -Order your food at the counter and wait for your number to be called, or they bring it to your table on a tray. Fantastic service!  -The PORTIONS are VERY GENEROUS!!! Two people could easily share one combo plate...unless you are a very BIG eater. Two scoops of sticky rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and sauteed cabbage come with your meal.  -They do offer a rice bowl with choice of meat for $4.99 if you want a smaller meal.  -CLEAN place!!! Clean restroom!  -Parking is very convenient. Leo's is located across the parking lot from Barnes & Nobles and next to Baskin Robbins.  -Mahalo!

-Thieves Market is a mini Flea Market with vintage treasures, jewelry, yard sale stuff, and misc. artisan vendors in a small dirt lot.  -Held the first Saturday of each month (I think? It's not real clear on their website).  -Monthly event is from 8am - 3pm (Again, not posted on their website, maybe I found this info on their FB page?)  -$1 for admission  -Get there early, parking can be a real hassle.  -There was a (greasy) food truck on site.  -Since it's held in an empty lot, there is a port-a-potty located nearby...so, don't drink lots of coffee before you go.   -There are like 4-5 gas stations along the 12 mile drive along Cave Creek from the 101 if you need a restroom, gas, or whatever...plus, a McDonald's a few miles from the 101 on Cave Creek (east side of the road).  -It is located: 6070 E. Valley Way. Go to their website for map and directions.  -I liked it, I would go again. I found some cool vintage stuff at really good prices.

-This store is located on the West side of the street, sort of behind the Burger King...not to be confused with the "Goodwill Furniture" store located further north on Scottsdale Rd.  -Clean Goodwill store. Well-lit. Friendly employees.  -TONS of clothing and a whole wall with newer fashion jewelry.  -It seems like everything that would normally be $1.99 at other Goodwill stores was $2.99 here...knik-knacks, games, plates, etc...$2.99.  -Furniture was average priced...some pieces were overpriced compared to other Goodwill stores.  -Convenient parking.  -I'm a fan of Goodwill Thrift Stores! This one isn't too bad.

-Open ONLY four days a month. Thurs-Sun, but check their website for actual dates.  -A variety of different Dealers set-up with fantastic vintage, french salvage, old books, vintage busts, bird cages, stuff like that, etc...kind of like a Paris Flea Market in an old auto garage. Way cool!  -Gorgeous display of merchandise, be sure to GRAB what you want, it might not be there when you come back.  -SUPER crowded on opening day. Packed with people and too many strollers in the small space. NOT a place for kids or babies, one kid broke a vntage vase.  -Parking SUCKS! Park up and down the nearby side streets and pull your car up to the store front if you need to load it up.  -Plenty of employees, but it was a little disorganized at first when people starting lining up to check out. I'm sure this will be better at future events.  -Good prices and amazing treasures!  -Cute restroom.

-CROWD control is OUT OF CONTROL!!!! (on Thursdays).  -If you go after Thursday, all the stuff is picked over.  -Stuff is very unique, but pricey!   -This is not the place to shop if you are seeking deals or bargains.  -Visual display is photo-worthy!  -PARKING is HORRIBLE! There is none!  -I wanted to love Sweet Salvage, but when the place exceeds Fire Marshall code and the building is stuffed so full of people that you can't even shop or move around, then the enjoyment is gone. :(  -The employees are super nice and friendly, but this does not make up for the lack of mob control.  -I would rather enjoy the beautiful photos they post online, because you won't be able to enjoy it in person with the mobs of women shopping like frenzied hungry piranhas packed in like sardines! No thank-you!

-SERVICE: Slow, terrible, and had to clear away our own dirty plates! Food Server seemed very inexperienced. They seem like they hire just "pretty" people with lack of customer service or any people skills, plus raunchy appearance.  -AMBIENCE: Very loud! Kids running around! Kids that wedged themselves in between my table and the shark tank (ATTN PARENTS: watch your kids OR leave them at home OR take them to CHUCK E. CHEESE instead!!!)  -FOOD: Room temperature meat, why wasn't it temperature HOT? Overall taste was ok, not the BEST BBQ. Potato salad was good, but was mostly mouthfuls of raw ONIONS than potatoes! (Mints anyone?)  -PORTION: Good  -RESTROOMS: Clean  -PARKING: Plentiful  -BAR: Go outside the bar area to see the flamingos.  -SUMMARY: Very disappointed in the average food and poor service. I would NOT eat here again.

-Cute stationary, gift wrap, and greeting cards.  -Friendly employees - ask them to demo products for you! You will want to buy everything they show you.  -Higher end products, I expect the prices to be higher than Michael's or JoAnn's craft stores. Plus, it's located in North Scottsdale. They carry their own rubber stamps.  -Evening classes available.  -Parking is sometimes a challenge, depending on the day of the week you visit. Paper Source is located towards the north part of the Scottsdale Quarter.

-Paper Crafting heaven!!!!!! My favorite paper arts & crafts store!  -This store is so cute! I walked around for 2 hours and kept finding so many neat things for making cards and mini journals.  -Friendly service! I called for directions and was greeted by a super friendly & helpful gal. They made me feel very welcomed when I arrived. They gave me a little gift with my purchase, what a nice bonus!  -Very reasonable prices. I saw many things here that I have never seen at Michael's or JoAnn's. Great selection!  -Parking was plentiful. I love the Paper Collage!
