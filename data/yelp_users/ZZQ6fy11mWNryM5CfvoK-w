I have no reason to give them less stars. They were friendly,explained the things I didn't know. Explained the groupon choices. It was all I expected and I will go back. The food was great,cooked perfect. The sauces were flavorful. It's casual, Hawaiian music. Looking forward to gong back and watching the fire dance sometime. Thank you for being kind..

They have a coupon for a 2 for $6 sandwich. We went and got the loaded Italian. Omg just the best sandwich ever at Arbys. Great flavor,just the right size. You leave wigh your mouth full of fabulous flavors. It's totally worth the try.

I've been many times and my favorite is the Mac daddy. It's macaroni and cheese with shredded pork on top. I love the jalapeno mac and cheese and the spicy pulled pork myself. It's enough meat and pasta I got a side of cornbread absolutely love their cornbread very homemade. I love this place I love the decor I love the music love the food and I will continue going back.

I have been to this place now a few times and each time , I've had great service and when something wasn't great, they fixed it immediately. I know folks make mistakes but as long as you make it better then I am cool :) The food is excellent and I will go back :) Thank you :)

The karaoke host sucks, the food ok, the drinks good. I came to sing, no order friends first don't you worry about the new people,you just go ahead and skip them. Not thinking I need to come back.

Not only did I get a Groupon with a great deal and find a new place. I met some really nice people, a very clean atmosphere, a casual beautiful girly atmosphere , a little Boutique. Is family run and it's a great family. They did a great job and my eyebrows were the best they've ever been! I'm coming back in referring friends and family. I loved this place big time. Thank you

This started out much longer then I decided to cut it short and keep to the facts. My 2013 has been a tad bit brutal so on Thanksgiving when check engine light went on I fell further apart. Goodyear whom I have always trusted jumped in to hopefully end 2013 much better than it has been going. Sofia not only handled my major breakdown on the phone well, she handled the business of my car with class and care. With all the other issues going on, I am happy to say they allowed my car not to be another. I am sitting here writing this, crying at the peace of mind that phone call left me in and the kindness in her words. Thank you for your care in customer service, care is how you speak and listen. Care in how you allowed my 2013 to end. I will never stray again from Goodyear due to a good coupon.

It's always busy. The food is fabulous. I find I eat slower and enjoy the time when there. I like the choices and capabilities to work with my diet. I've taken many friend's here and we'll continue. It's one of my top fav breakfast restaurants.

This was my first time here. I loved it, skillet with egg whites, bacon chicken, jack cheese, grits,raisen toast. The meal was wonderful. The service was great. It was a bit too noisy for me but since it was a holiday weekend that makes sense.

The New Name of this place is Snazzy Dogz. The New Owner is Kelly King. She and her  staff are the most compassionate dog lovers I have ever met.  They make the dogz look amazing and then all the extra's! This place puts so much love and effort into each client and owner ;)   They have won over some clients by just having the heart to reach out at times needed. I would drive completely out of my way monthly and want everyone to know this place is worthy of all your pets needs!  Ask for Kelly she is the BEST!!!

I have not been to this place, but my daughter has and speaks on and on about them all the time, sounds like a great place but I am East Valley. Anyhow, she brought home pumpkin & apple pies from this place home for T Day and  had bragged on and on about them being the best pies ever. I didn't believe her and said we shall see, my sister makes some great homemade pies. Well.. I never want a pie from anywhere else ever !! The pies alone were literally the most flavorful, beautiful best tasting pies in the world to date thus far, but now I want to eat there . So excited to now have a meal there.What a GREAT introduction :)  Thank you!!

This was my second time here and I loved it even more. I was wishy washy about what I wasted, Candace was a peach. Didn't rush me, then brought me the drink I wanted from the moment she spoke about it. Let's face it she knew the customer better. The drink a blue margarita. Then fabulous chips,salsa abd huge plate of guacamole! I knew I'd never have room for the dinner lol. Huge chimichanga,I don't remember the name but it was huge. Took half home. I loved the manager stopping by to ask how things were. To me that always shows they care. I loved the night out at this fabulous smelling restaurant. I'd definitely go back and refer others. Thank you for terrific service and food!

I have the pulled pork sandwich absolutely wonderful the fried pickles were fabulous ,I love their mashed potatoes. I've been here a few times and when I have the money in the pocket I will go there again. It's a nice place to take guest for some good bbq.

The girl who greeted us was kind. Then I had to figure out how it worked on my own. Then walked to the begin,explained the size bowl. Small is extremely small. Pricy for a small. Then load as much as I can in the tiny bowl. The people who toss your food to cook are rude,half fell off,who cares I'm just paying $11 for a tiny bowl. Then you just have to figure out what to do next. Do I wait?? Guess not. Go sit they will bring to you. Ok my food was great but I selected it so that was expected. Some things I didn't have in my selection were in my food??. Fiery hot peppers..no thanks. I'm probably not coming back. I'll stick with. YC's get more food for less and they guide you with manners.

I've been here now a few times and always enjoy their did. Burgers are so tasty but they have skinny fabulous fries my favorite of all places. The best part about each trip is we get a Marjerilerita with a shot of grand mariner. They sugar the rim and it's just the best drink there. Two is plenty* the staff are all great servers. The place is always busy. It's clearly a favorite place to go for many. Will continue to go back as a semi regular!

When finally my turn after long wait. The boy at the counter asked what I wanted. I said haven't been on over 30 years. I asked a few questions on products, his reply they are the same everywhere. I said ok then then asked for a vanilla tea. He asked if I wanted cream,I did no,he gave it anyway,made a mess of the cup.I asked if he would wipe down my cut,he replied the napkins are over there pointed. I asked about straws,again points. No customer service. I'll never go back. Rude rude rude

I found the staff to be rude, disinterested, unhelpful and will never step foot inside there again. I refuse to give a BIG BUSINESS my pet business ever again. I am now a HUGE FAN of SNAZZY DOGS a GREAT!! place I found after taking my pets to this wreck of a crew.

I order from here often enough that after a while you think they could get the order right. I've gotten it wrong I'd say out of 40 times,maybe 6 have been correct. They have a part on the bottom when ordering for directions. Why ask if you refuse to look at it??? You're so fast you can't even do the basics. It's been going on forever but I decided to finally say something.

Here I am again, I love the sandwich hate the fact that they ask if you for specific directions and then ignore them. YES! I want sweetener for my tea, YES I want napkins for my sandwich. How hard is it to follow the directions? It takes a moment of your time and it keeps the customer happy???  Why can't you follow the directions??? Please answer me. Ummmmm no more tips .

They said they hired someone to make sure the bags all have what the people ask for!!!! This is great news to me. I'm now 100% happy with Jimmy John's. Thank you

Heaven forbid you go there when there's no lines the bored staff will be rude, careless ,not explain where to stand in line or which direction to go ,then throw you in front of a bright light tell you to smile with your thumbs up,but not tell you what that's for. I didn't care for the staff or the treatment. If they are this way when bored , how are they when they are busy. Not impressed in the slightest .

I'm not a coffee person but a tea person I am. Omg I got the hot chai, it was prefect! I felt from the moment I got there I was special,cared for, the customer service is beautiful. We sat and watched the others after we got our drink. They remembered the names of the regulars,they asked engaging questions remembered details of what was said last time. They care! This alone would make me come back over and over. I suggest everyone try Dutch brother's,you won't be disappointed. Thank you

Came here with friends who was in town for a short visit. She said she wanted steak and since we were in the neighborhood, stopped in. She ordered steak and lobster and wasn't as hungry so I ordered 3 pork sandwich. She loved hers and I loved mine. Just in case you haven't heard of it, they begin bringing us fresh cooked bread, soft butter. The bread alone is worth the trip. No bread is better. This place has great service, casual atmosphere, huge. Just a great date place, or friends meeting place or whatever. Try them out, you won't be disappointed!

Hard to get someone to wait on you, sat at a table possibly 15, then finally asked someone waking past,do I go to the bar or how do I get service? The reply, yeah you can go to the bar,so as I am at the bar, they say, or I can take your order. No clear stations. No-one in a rush to serve you a drinks or food. The food was good. Not worth the money. Just unimpressed. I had to ask for the bill twice. So basically, not thinking I'd go back. The bar was not full enough to not be served or to have to wait 15 to 30 min per each request. The only selling point was a sweet man very friendly doing karaoke. He wanted me to stay more than the bar.

I am thrilled to give 5 stars and quite honestly I'd give more if possible. Casual,build your own pizza,all toppings possible totally unlimited, 5 or 6 different sauces. Build your own 10 pie, gluten free,white or wheat. I had white and normally I'll eat crust but it's just crust. I've never had a better crust. I honestly wanted to keep eating after full just for the flavor. Have a few beers,soda. Tv screens,kids coloring. Gelato to finish with. I'll go back again and again. My new favorite pizza place. Hands down!!
