I used to have really fond memories of this place as a kid. I loved the decor and always thought that every restaurant should serve spumoni upon completion of a meal, but the romance has since ended now that I am an adult.   In the past year I have found myself here often as a central meeting place that could accommodate a large group. In both of those occasions we had the save server who lacked any ounce of charm in his body and felt way too comfortable with the fact that his gratuity was added into our bill due to size. He was brash and acted annoyed the entire time and despite our size we were pretty low maintenance.   Other than service, the food is doing little to impress me. It has become one of those places where I am never truly satisfied with what I ordered. Because their menu is traditional fare I find myself comparing it to every other Italian place I have been and none of their dishes stand out as the best I have had or even close to it. The portions do not match the price in my opinion and neither does the quality. I just end up walking away from dinner feeling a bit cheated by the entire experience. I wish I could fall in love all over again with this landmark, but it is going to take a lot to win me over.

I went here recently with my mom for lunch. We had driven past it numerous times and finally bit the bullet and stopped.   It is a perfect spot for a downtown lunch. Cute, quaint, and quick service. Both my mother and I had the soup and 1/2 sandwich and while I wish there was more flavor in the soup, the sandwich was good and tasty. We topped off our lunch with a warm chocolate chip cookie- which was the highlight of my afternoon. If anything I will need to go back for a cookie, or two.

I agree with others that it seems a bit expensive at $15- but that still would not steer me away from going.  For the first time in about 8 years I found myself at the DBG with some out of town family. Wanting to enjoy the weather (since they had just escaped the cold grey winter of Detroit) the gardens were the perfect spot. The garden is equipped with wide paths and plenty of benches to help the old timers pace themselves. It helps remind us city dwellers of the beauty the desert can have and how unique Phoenix truly is.

We ended up there on Saturday night after a fabulous dinner and some pre drinking. We were met with friendly faces and an awesome waitress. She was the type of waitress that could anticipate what you would want to drink and never kept us waiting. It is a very chill, laid back environment, great for drinking the night away. the service was so impressive we never made it to the list of other places we wanted to try that night.

Loved it!!!  We went there last Friday night to be romantic and it definitely did the trick. I had never experienced a BYOB restaurant before and after experiencing it first hand I am hooked. We started the evening with the fillet Mignon tacos and they were fabulous, the perfect start. I had the chicken breast. It was stuffed with goodness and was served with squash, corn, and garlic mashed potatoes. A drizzle of pesto lined the outside of the dish and was the perfect accompaniment. My husband has the salmon as was very impressed (I don't do fish so I can't go into more detail). For dessert we had the four berry tarte, it was warm and the perfect end to a fabulous meal. They serve the type of food that continues to come up in conversation throughout the evening, in a good way.

A little background....   My husband is from a sleepy community about an hour south of Chicago. My husband could/would eat pizza everyday of his life if I permitted. When we went back to visit his parents he actually took me on a pizza tour of the area all of which ended with his absolute favorite pizza, Aurelio's. His love for this pizza stems from childhood and I honestly do not think you could convince him that there is a greater pizza out there. I even once looked into shipping Aurelio's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive.   Fast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite. The crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled (or appears to be). They are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day aren't too shabby. We have never had an issue with service or our order on the several occasions we have been One of my favorite things about Spinato's is the ice, seriously I have a passion for crushed ice and lots of it!

I am ashamed at myself for not putting a review up for Deno's till now! Deno's is a hidden gem of Surprise. Nestled across the street from Del Web hospital and next door to a Hallmark store and a Safeway, one might not expect to come across some of the best pizza Surprise has to offer, but trust me- just try it. Deno's serves up thin flaky crust pizza cut into squares, the kind of pizza I fell in love with in Illinois and what I consider to be true Chicago style pizza. The toppings are under a blanket of cheese and there is never a dull bite. Deno's is reasonably price and BYOB. It is not unusual to see patrons in there with mini coolers enjoying a variety of beverages with their dinner. Please don't let the bare space and strip mall location deter you from trying it.

If it was possible to give no stars, Networks would of earned this honor from me. First off, even with pub crawl happening, the clientel at Networks is your typical hotel bar clientele. Being under 35, and not trying to get laid while at a conference out of town, I felt like an instant outcast. Secondly we came to Networks to take advantage of the pub crawl special of $1 beer and wine but once we made it to the bar we were quickly told it was a misprint and pretty much treated like shit after that. Jason, the "manager", strolled over to the bar with a fresh plate of assorted appetizers pizza as most people would call it, with his cheap suit jacket and an earpiece. I am not sure if he felt powerful with the earpiece in but it really helped add to the entire douche vibe. He was short and unaccommodating with our party and not even apologetic for the misprint. Mistakes happen and if Jason was a little bit better of a manager, he could of convinced our party of 8 to stick around and spend some money at his bar even if we did not get the discount we originally thought we would. Jason needs to remove the stick from his ass, the ear piece from his ear, and take a few more management courses before I would even consider returning.

I woke up this morning and rolled over to look into the eyes of my one year old pit bull mix and it just reminded me how glad I am that organizations like the Arizona Humane Society exist.   Ever since my family moved to the valley in 1987, we have been adopting dogs from the Humane Society. When I first met my husband we continued that tradition by adopting our cat Lewis. When we moved in together we expanded our family with darling border collie/golden retriever mix Roxanne, and when we bought our first home we added Lola (our bed hog pit bull mix). My family would not be complete without any of our rescue pets and our experience at the Humane Society will always bring us back.   The Campus for Compassion is a beautiful facility and is staffed with some of the most compassionate people I have ever met. Both dog adoptions gave us the honor to work with Perry (of Pets on Parade fame) and it is evident that he has a true passion for the work he does. Our adoption counselors have always been extremely helpful and thorough. My family will continue to support the Humane Society for the years to come.

From the outside I did not know what to expect, but once inside you are blown away. This museum is much more than meets the eye and has something for everyone.  We did the Living Social deal to get a membership and on our first visit, even though we hadn't sent us the membership card yet, they still let us in no questions asked with our printed voucher. The museum was not overrun and there was so much to see. The gold panning was one of my favorite spots in the whole place and instantly made me think this would be an awesome place for our son's birthday, once he was old enough.   Great spot for families and anyone who just gets a kick out of history and science, I cannot wait to go back.

I am going to jump on the "this bar sucks" bandwagon. I am not fond of the bar, the staff or the cliental. My experience was a crowded bar where I had to push myself up against every Tom, Dick and Hairy just to make my way through the crowd. I even got my butt grabbed by some random guy and when I turned around to shoot him a dirty look he said, " pass that on to your friend with the nice ass." Thanks- real boost for the self esteem buddy.  Anyways- don't go there unless your desperate.

Solid choice for breakfast in downtown Glendale.  Kiss the Cook has been around since I can remember and it was always a place my mom would take us for a girly breakfast or lunch. Once my dad caught on to the fluffiness of their omelets it became a family favorite.  It had been years since I had been back but the husband and I were in the mood for breakfast and since we are westsiders and slow to wake up on the weekend we knew we wouldn't be able to make it to the east valley to try something different.  Matt had never been to Kiss the Cook so it seemed like the perfect choice, the fact that there was a meat lover's omelet on special confirmed that choice. When he asked to sub the green onions in the omelet for something else, he was greeted with enthusiasm and encouragement from the waitress, "Yes! you are paying for it, might as well have something you like in it!"  This instantly won over my husband who often asks to sub or omit ingredients.  The baker's basket is a great touch and I have always had great friendly service. Our food came out promptly, fresh, and our drinks never ran dry. Best part we were in and out in 35 minutes which helped us still be able to enjoy a full day of errands, despite not rolling out of bed until 10am.

The Deli is the ultimate dive bar. Pool tables, darts, refrigerator cases full of beer to take home and slim jims sold at the bar. I should also mention they have a scratchers machine there too which has robbed me on numerous occasions. If you want a cheap drink, hear some classic rock, and try to kick your friend's ass at darts- this is the place to go. No need to dress up, come as you are and come to have a good time.

I am surprised there are not more reviews for Dillon's seeing how popular it is on the west-side.  It is a good BBQ restaurant, with a wide menu, friendly staff, and quick service (for the most part). Despite being overrun with white hairs, there is a good mix of families and often it gets really loud in their. The BBQ sauce is tasty and the brisket, pork, and baby back ribs are some of the best you will find over here. It is the type of place you can go to and know you will always have a quality meal- no surprises here. It has become a staple with my family and often a place we take out of town company. With locations in Surprise and 67th and the 101, it is convenient to most of the west-side.

Oh Amsterdam...what a short an interesting relationship we have had. I remember my first visit to you on a Sunday last summer. In search of karaoke my friend and I stumbled through your doors to a quiet room with only a few patrons. Apparently I had "tell me your life story" written all over my face and I lent my ear to a lovely gentleman who twisted my arm and took my karaoke virginity. I was somehow  tricked into a "Somewhere Out There" duet.  My second visit was on New Year's with my gay bar virgin husband and the rest of my New Year's crew. This time around the whole club was opened up and alive with a variety of people.  Despite your orientation, Amsterdam is the type of club that almost anyone can come and enjoy themselves. It is a great mix of people and music. The drinks are good and so is the atmosphere.

Sooooo gooooood!!!  I have been wanting to try Fez ever since I have been on Yelp and finally the opportunity arose. Met a group of girls there for lunch and belated birthday celebration equipped with homemade funfetti cupcakes. We started off with the sweet potato fries which were divine. Next came the hummus...which I will admit I am still thinking about today. I had the rosemary chicken sandwich and it was a great marriage of flavors. It was a little challenging eating lunch on the sofa, but the food, and the company, made it worth while.  ~~wanders off dreaming of hummus~~

Even though it has been a couple of months since I first visited Sierra Bonita- my meal is still fresh on my mind, I cannot wait to go back!  I started my meal with the green corn tamale-amazing! Seriously, I could of eaten 5 of these. The sauce made the whole experience. I followed it up with the Atole Pinon Hotcakes and was not disappointed.  The hotcake was lighter than I thought it would be but full of flavor. The husband the swordfish which was a catch of the day special.   Our service was prompt and the atmosphere allowed us to occupy a table for an extended period of time and catch up with friends in between bites.

Despite driving by a million times, last Saturday was my first visit to Rosie's. Definitely a no BS establishment, which is what I love most. A place to sit, a good beer, an attentive waitress, and great company is all I need in life- Rosie's accommodated that perfectly.

I made my second visit to Ticoz last night and there will be return visits in my future.   The cons: My biggest complaint are the tortilla chips, I think they are San Pablo brand, the kind you pick up from Shamrock Foods(the hubs works there)....not bad chips but they are the same brand served at my school cafeteria. It just seems out of place in an establishment like this.   The pros: Both times I have been here I have had the pork chili verde. The chili verde is served over two cheese enchiladas with a side of beans and saffron rice. They drizzle a chipotle cream sauce over the beans which is awesome. I found myself squeezing a taste of the beans and cream sauce with every bite I took. The chili verde itself has a little bit of spice too it, but the enchiladas compliment it nicely. The passion fruit sangria is very good. Good enough that I am pretty confident I could easily finish off a pitcher myself. A good blend of citrus, without being overly sweet.   Both times the service has been good and we did not have to wait. Ticoz joins my list of places I have not taken my husband too, yet...

I really like Tagliani's. I know it is not the best Italian food I will ever have, but it is something different than Olive Garden on the west side of town. Yummy bread served before the meal and 2 options for portion sizes really help bring me back. Their dinner sizes are huge and are served with salad or soup and their lunch portion is about half the size of dinner but still too much food at times. The chicken saltimboca has me addicted. A chicken breast rolled with fontina and prosciutto, breaded, sliced and served on a bead of pasta with a creamy marinara with chunks of tomatoes and prosciutto in it. My husband finds numerous choices to please his tomato hating palette.  They just opened a third location in Avondale.

I love this place.  My husband and I decided to spend a night downtown to celebrate our first year of marital bliss. We booked a king suite poolside and the room was much more than we could ever imagine. The decor is right up my alley- modern, quirky, unique. Our room was huge and comfortable. The bed was comfy and I absolutely loved how the art work could be used as a blackout curtain. The pool makes you feel like you are caught in a trendy scene in a movie. the perfect place to chill out and forget about what lies outside the courtyard. The price was right and I can guarantee we will be back and recommend this place to all of our friends.

We absolutely love this place! Not for the health food crowd, but definitely for people who do not mind pounded, fried meat and giant beer. They rotate between 4-5 soups and each are delicious and come with every dinner or you can opt to get a German salad for about $2.00 more.  It is impossible to leave this place still feeling hungry.

It is places like this that make me wish I lived downtown or at least closer to downtown.   I don't know if I can write anything that has not yet been written about the Roosevelt. The decor, concept, menu, and atmosphere are incredible. It is the perfect low key drinking spot. The bartenders were slammed but still accommodating the server gave us the heads up on open seating in the front room and checked on us frequently despite the crowd. I don't know if we just picked the right night to go but we didn't encounter to many undesirable characters and they seemed to keep to themselves. I am anxious to go back and try some food and explore the beer menu.

While I do not rock the skinny jeans or own a Mac, I do love beer and places that showcase beer.  I like the laid back nature of the Lost Leaf and I love the variety of beers they offer.  I hate the fact that they have tall tables though, dresses and bar stools are not always a good combination. Avoid this place on First Friday or any major event in the area, it fills up fast and it can be a fight just to make it up to the bar.

Seriously delicious!  Hopped in the car this weekend with my mom and kid in tow and used the Yelp Ap on my android phone. It lead us to El Ranchero, which is typically not our Mexican go to in Wickenburg, but I am so glad we found this gem. The chips were good, so were the salsa and the bean dip. I ordered the Tricolor Enchilada combo and they were probably the best enchiladas I have had.  The chicken was so tasty, the shredded beef had good flavor, and the cheese enchilada was made using Mexican cheese (queso fresco I think) and it was sooo good.   The best part could of been that for 2 huge meals, 2 drinks, and an order of sopapillas it was under $25.  Cannot wait to take the husband there.

I'm in love!   I kept hearing the buzz about the Ranch Market and decided to stop by one weekend with my mom. All the previous reviews hit the nail on the head when they say that it is an assault on the senses. When you first walk up outside grilling of carne and pollo asada make your mouth water. Then you walk in and are hit with tall cases of pastries, and some of the best Mexican pastries and cookies I have had in the valley.   I could not contain my excitement and found myself dragging my husband there to show him the mecca and the Ranch Market did not disappoint. We picked up tortillas, butter nut cookies, tomatillo sauce, cheeses, and Mexican Coke (made with sugar not corn syrup) and dined in style- on the cheap. The employees were friendly and helpful and seriously the prices are shockingly low compared to some major Phoenix chains.   If anything it is worth going once to soak up the atmosphere.

So it has been a couple of years since I have been here, and it has been a coupe of years for a reason.  My friends and I used to love going to Bobby McGee's for drinks. Any place that serves booze out of a bucket was a-OK in my book- the Q Lounge changed all of that.  First off it is trying too hard, way too hard. For the location and the clients there is no reason why there should be bottle service. The only thing this has done is encouraged Scottsdale douche bag wannabes not to travel the distance to full fill their douche bag destiny. The door men act like they are Stacey and Clinton on "What not to Wear," and gave my friend a hard time about his flip flops, while letting in about 10 guys with baggy ass jeans and 3/4 of their boxers exposed in the meantime. The crowd is mixed, but not in a good way, the music is OK, the set up is cramped, and you pretty much leave disappointed. You cannot aspire to be a Scottsdale club at 20 something avenue and Northern, it is not possible. I miss the old Bobby McGee's, I miss the party buckets, and I miss being able to go in and dance with my friends without having one of them be felt up by some random dude. If we wanted that we would of went to Barcelona.

I am hesitant to review the Greek Patio because I am afraid it will grow in popularity.   I love our quaint go to Greek place. We have been visiting the patio for the past couple of years and it is never a disappointment. The kabobs, gyros, Greek spaghetti, Greek salad, saganaki, and everything else we have tried has been tasty. The space is small and quaint and sometimes they get carried away with the Mediterranean dance music, but the service is always prompt and courteous and the place is always clean.

I agree with the previous poster that the environment leads a little to be desired- but we still really enjoy this hole in the wall. If your ass is hanging off the bar stool the bar is actually not a bad place to sit. There is one bartender in particular that makes his way into a conversation with everyone and will remember your drink order even a month later. They serve the beer cold and have a decent happy hour- $3.00 drafts and 1/2 off most appetizers.  There is a big variety of fried bar food with a few unique items. The cabbage rolls are surprisingly good (cabbage, corn beef, potatoes, cheese, fried in a wanton wrapper) and the cheese curds help coat the stomach to handle a few extra beers. If you are a karaoke junkie you will have no problem singing your song on their Thurs night karaoke and they have live music on Friday and I believe Saturday too.  Basically if you like hole in the wall drinking establishments- this works.

Silver did what the other bars we went to on the pub crawl did not....they made the purchase of the wrist band worth our while! After getting the stink eye from Jason over at Networks and taking a well shot of vodka at Marjele's, my pub crawl group wandered over to Silver hoping that they indeed were honoring their printed pub crawl special. Our wrist bands saved us a cover charge and allowed us to purchase $1 beer!! The DJ didn't suck, the people watching was prime, and I was able to sit down and just have a good time with friends. The crowd was an interesting mix and some people didn't get the memo that Halloween was Friday, but that aside, this place could have potential. I am not sure if I would love it as much if I had to pay full price for my drink, but I think they used pub crawl the way it was meant to be used, as a marketing tool. Next time I am downtown and looking to dance, Silver will be on the list of places to consider.

I will be honest- I didn't going into La Piazza al Forno with the highest of expectations. Just because a restaurant makes it on TV doesn't necessarily mean it will be an instant winner, but I was pretty impressed with our La Piazza experience.   First thing that left an impression- everything came fast and piping hot. Seriously it seemed like we never had to wait more than 5 minutes for food. The wine list has a variety of reasonable priced bottles- $15 for a decent pino grigio- not shabby. The husband and I shared the toasted ravioli, good,but I could of used a few more (it only comes with 4). The batter was crisp and not greasy. Then we shared the Italian Stallion. My last "Italian Stallion" was a botched attempt to embarrass a friend by getting her a stripper for her birthday- and I must say this was a VAST improvement. Plenty of toppings, HUGE peperoni, and the perfect wood fired taste on the crust. For dessert we did the fried dough dessert after discovering they did not have the Italian Wine cake. Not earth shattering, but good to share. I think it is the same as the pizza dough, just coated in powder sugar.   It is obvious that they have recently done a remodel and for the size of the place they make good use of their space. Friendly staff and a good place to sit and catch up with old friends...we will definitely be back.

This place has really won me over.   We have been back twice since the initial review and I cannot wait to go back. Since our first visit I have now tried the bruchetta which is very good, the almond wine cake- sooo good!, and finally the Mediterranean raviolis which is now on my list of crave worthy dishes. 3 cheese raviolis, with a balsamic sauce and feta sprinkled on top. Unlike anything I have tried other places but I seriously could drench every pasta in that sauce.

I have had much better BBQ, with much better service, for way less money than at Lucille's.  I was excited to try the place because my parents had really talked it up, but maybe I just went in with too high of expectations. The hostess had misplaced a few brain cells and asked our party about 5-6 times what our name was, even though they had one of our numbers to call when the table was ready. Our water was ok, but super slow when it came to the checks and actually checking in on us. I liked the biscuits, but they were not amazing, a nice touch after waiting for so long to get a table though. No one in my party was amazed by their meals but one of the most disappointing was the mac and cheese. It sounded so good, but came out dry and mushy- gross enough to turn you off of mac and cheese for a couple of weeks.  So-so food, extremely loud restaurant- it will take a while before I consider to give it a second shot.

After hearing so many good things about Bountiful Baskets I just had to give it a try, especially with a pick up location just down the street.  While I love the idea of the co-op and I look forward to getting my basket, I really wish they had smaller basket options. Unless I am able to convince my sister to go halves with me and my husband I find that a lot of produce ends up going to waste. I would also love a fruit only option. Despite my minor complaints, the price vs. the amount of produce you get is awesome and a great inspiration for meal planning.

I was part of Kristen's group and for me the Bomberos experience is a good solid four.  Despite the the incident with the log- we were finally sat inside with is a little dark and set up for conversations. The patio was nice but is a little cramped. The live music that was being played was a little loud for the size of the patio. As for the menu, my panini was good, not stellar, but I was just glad to have something of substance. The wine list was unfamiliar and we took the suggestion of the waiter for La Playa and seriously that wine (and the company :) ) made the night. Bomberos has a lot of potential and I will definitely be back, even if just to pick up a bottle of that wine!

Yum!  If you are in the mood for a good, juicy burger exactly the way you like it- Cheeburger Cheeburger is the place for you. Everything is build your own- burgers, shakes, and chicken sandwiches. My husband was a bit more adventurous than me. He had a 1/2 lb burger with pepper jack, sauted mushrooms, black olives, and honey mustard ( I know he is a weirdo) he was in heaven. I played on the safe side with a 1/3lb burger with jack/cheddar cheese, thousand island, and bacon. The burgers were actually cooked to medium, the buns were good, they are just god burgers. It is an al a carte setting so you order the fries separately. Those are also delicious. We spent about $20 for the both of us to have a burger and split an order of fries- not too shabby considering how tasty it was.

Well it is official- Glendale, AZ has a bar. Not a restaurant with a bar in it, or one of the few beyond dive bars that still show up on the side of the road from time to time. Hell's Half Acre is an actual bar, no food. The place itself is not huge but it sits across from Fox's Sports grill at Westgate. They have a patio area in the front and as you enter the place you are greeted with counter height seating and an elevated couch "L" shaped seating area. It has an updated western feel about it without being over the top.Large projection screens line the wall and when we came (9ish) they were showing a variety of music videos(country, Motley Crew, and even Little Kim).  We grabbed a few bar stools at a table near the bar and despite being busy, we had a waitress taking our drink order in less than 5 minutes. The prices are not as high as I thought the would be. They have a special where you can get a shot and a beer for $7, Irish car bobs run about $6-7, a Guinness was $4.50, and a Bud was about $3.50. It is the type of place that encourages their customers to get up on the bar and even built in a step stool on the end of the bar to help with the process.  I can definitely see myself going bar here, and not just because i is the first of it's kind at Westgate, but because they actually seem to know what they are doing. The service was good, the drinks came quick, and despite being crowded everyone was in good spirits and having a good time.

We have always meant to try Amuse Bouche, but the idea of a crowd always turned us away. We stopped in on Sat for a late lunch/early dinner and the place was dead! I had the Cabernet burger. Really tasty and totally different than any other hamburger I have had. The taste of the wine really came through and the onion aoili was a nice touch. I wish the bun was different though, tasted good but pretty much fell apart. The husband had the meatloaf sandwich and really enjoyed it, he did wish that he had fried instead of the side salad though.  The waitress was sweet and excited to find out that we were Surprise residents and asked us to come back, especially during the summer, since the snow bird crowd is now thinning out. It sounds like breakfast they may be packed, but I would love to try it out, and I am curious to see what dinner specials they run.

I am giving them 5 stars for not being a Starbucks.   Bad Ass coffee is another chain but with only 2 locations in Arizona it still has its local charm. While I am not a hardcore coffee drinker I do love my frou frou frozen coffee drinks and Bad Ass has a good selection to please any taste. With flavors like Snickerlicious, Nutty Irishman, and Apple Pie their latte's  give you are great alternative to what we usually see within the city limits. The flavors are not dominated with a bitter coffee after taste but not too overwhelming that you forget what you are drinking alltogether. Another highlight is the fact that the blended drinks are actually blended- no chunks of ice waiting to ater down your last sips here! They are newly opened and even offer a drive through for those on the go. Try it and experiance something other than Starbucks- who knows you might actually like it!

Great New York style pizza and great wings. Good deal and great people with a great sense of humor. You can tell they actually enjoy what they are doing. This has become a quick favoite of ours for takeout and even eat in.

I love Babbo. There are two locations, one at 67the and the 101 and the one out here in Surprise.  Upon sitting down you are greeted with warm bread that has a few onions and a hit of salt on top. It is good alone or dipped in oil and vinegar.   They have a few really good appetizers. The bruchetta romana is amazing! Do yourself a favor and try it. The firecracker rolls are tasty but beware when they say spicy marinara they mean it! The toasted ravioli come in a sausage ragu which is beyond packed with sausage.   All of the pasta I have tried has been good. The bowl o' bolognese is great and one of the best bowls of spaghetti I have had. The sauce is full of meat and is just yummy. Their fresh tomato mozzarella is nice and light with tons of fresh tomatoes and chunks of mozzarella. Their calzones and pizza is also very good.  They have a big menu and everything we have tried we really liked which makes it harder to chose the next time we come. Another great thing is their prices. Expect to pay $5-7 for appetizers, $5-$9 for dinner salads (half or full),  sandwiches, calzones, and pizzas will run you $8-$10, and I think the most pastas are in the $9-$11 range. The portions are a good size and the service is quick.  If you haven't tried this place yet and you are in Surprise, defiantly give it a try!

If you like the Big Bang...you will like the Shout House. Biggest difference is FOOD! That's right as you enjoy your slow service and live entertainment, you can actually nibble on something. I personally prefer it over Big Bang for this fact. I ned somethign to line the stomach as I enjoy a drink, and if I am going to pay to get into a place I like it to be a one stop shop.

I was in desperate need of Happy Hour last week and after running through our regular choices, Kristin and Melissa suggested that we try Maizie's.   I was the first to arrive and scored one of the limited parking spots in the front and was greeted warmly by multiple staff members and escorted to a table in the back. I love how quaint and modern the space was. It is exactly the design aesthetic that I enjoy.   Their menu is large and inviting. It has a ton of sandwiches and burgers, pizzas, and salads- perfect casual cuisine. The Happy Hour was $2 off wine, $5 select appetizers, and $3 draft. Only a few of their standard starters were excluded in the happy hour special which still leaves you with at least 6 choices. We settled on spinach dip, salsa, and pesto bruchetta. The spinach dip came out piping hot which I foolishly burned my tongue on, but all can be forgiven with a cold glass of Riesling. I also tried their soup of the day which was French onion and it was delish, it left me wanting more.   I don't know if it was the three glasses of wine or the fact that Maizie's was that good, but I raved all the way home to my husband and promised to take him there soon.

So Maizie's did not disappoint on my second visit and has now earned a spot on my midtown rotation.   I brought my best friend there last night for some much needed girl's night out. She ordered the salmon and blood orange Cosmo and loved both. I ordered the inside-out feta burger. The burger was stuffed with feta and sun-dried tomatoes and cooked to a perfect medium. The burger was juicy and the side of chipotle hummus served as a nice condiment for it. For dessert we spilt the "Half-Baked," which was amazing for two girls who used to make cookie dough in our college apartment just to eat. It came out piping hot and appeared to be a regular cookie dessert, inside was the surprise when we realized that it was pure cookie dough.   Our waitress took good care of us and was helpful when my friend asked for suggestions.

I have fallen in love with a non chain restaurant less than a mile from my house....In Surprise, AZ I never thought this would happen!  Vogue Bistro is a small place with a lot of style. When you walk in there is a large bar to the right, the kitchen straight back, and a huge black chandelier in the middle of the dining room. Above the bar is a large flat screen TV with an ornate gold frame with old Hollywood movies and fashions shows on loop. There is a large patio with fans and misters and looks very comfortable. The theme is fashion without being over the top and still man friendly, as my husband put it.   They bill themselves as contemporary American with French techniques. The menu is small but reasonably priced. They offer daily specials and on the night we came there where four. Just a warning the menu goes up to about $15 an entree but the specials can be much more. My husband had Alaskan King Salmon with snow crab, he was in heaven, but as you could imagine it was a pricier dish. We started off with wine, they have a pretty decent list, and appetizers. I had the bruchetta ($3) toppings change daily but I had the tomato basil and it was very tasty.  The plate had 3 pieces of bruchetta and it was just enough to start the pallet. My husband had the calamari ($4) once again a perfect portion for one. I had the steak frites ($15) and it was divine. I was surprised by the size of the steak, a lot larger than I have had in similar restaurants and it was served with a huge serving of the shoestring "Vogue" fries. They were crispy and light and tasted really good in the peppercorn sauce that was served with the steak. My husband also tried one of their "designer" martini's and was served from the shaker at table side. We ended dinner with a pineapple tart which was tasty. The menu has panini's and burgers priced around $8-$9 and they all looked good coming from the kitchen.   I am looking forward to trying more things on their menu and exploring the wine list a bit more!

Much better than I thought it was going to be! I guess I was always a little afraid of dinner theater, but the AZ Broadway Theater exceeded my expectations. My father had gotten us tickets as a Christmas present and with the expiration date quickly approaching we decided to give it a shot and catch their presentation of Cabaret. Was it the best version of Cabaret i had ever seen? No, but it was well acted and the set was actually impressive. We sat in the front row (section A) and we had a good view of the stage. The menu had a variety of German inspired dishes and we each had something different, I had a chicken dish, my parent had the beef dish, and Matt had swordfish. Your ticket includes soup or salad, an entree, and the show. At intermission you can chose to participate in dessert and I strongly suggest you do. Our waitress warned us that by then we would have a sweet tooth and she was correct. My mother had the German chocolate torte and it was huge- three people could of easily shared it. I had the apple strudel and it was very good, and my father had the sugar free peach cobbler (he is diabetic) and he was pleasantly surprised. The service was prompt and your glass was always filled. The matanee on Saturday was flooded with Red Hat Society members but honestly growing up in Peoria I have come to expect nothing less of the area. The only downside was the wait. They ask you to arrive between 12 and 12:45 and the show starts at 2 (the matinee showing). We got there at noon and finished our meals with a little more than 30 minutes before show time. The menu changes with each show so it is definitely worth checking out their website and planning your visit around what you like to eat.

So I was starting to feel like I was the last person on the planet to try Pita Jungle and the waalaaa! One pops up conveniently in Glendale. Since the opening I have been there twice and impressed both times.   The first time I had the shwarma wrap- HUGE! I couldn't even eat half that sucker and I'm a big girl. The next time I went I had the chicken Philly pita and it was divine. The portions are huge and the hummus is delicious. We had no problems with service, everyone seemed to be on their toes.  We will definitely be going back...in fact Pita Jungle has moved into the "craving" category.

This place has potential!  Inside there are about 3 different bar areas and the main dining area is open and has access to 2 of the bars. Outside is ample patio space and two more bars. The food was decent. My husband and father had the fish and chips and my mother and I had the Sheppard's pie. We shared a Guinness brownie for dessert which was good because the brownie was not overly sweet.  The thing that excites me most about this place is the large open dining area. It looks like a large drinking hall. Large tables in the middle, cozy wood booths on one wall, pub tables in another. With two separate bar areas in there it makes you feel that at any moment the whole place could erupt in song (at least this is what I am hoping will happen). The grand opening is not for a few weeks so the menu is limited right now, it will be interesting to see what becomes of this place after that.

Last week in an attempt to give Lis Doon Varna another try, I dragged my husband and my best friend in from out of town there. It was a Sunday evening, about 6 o'clock and while the parking lot looked full the actual restaurant had over half of their tables empty. That being said the hostess told us it would be a 10 minute wait. That would of been fine if it hadn't turned into a 25 minute wait and the same hostess kept disappearing. About 5-6 other tables came in after us and were all given the same quote on wait time.   I completely understand on being short of servers or a back up in the kitchen, but management needed to step up and help out the in experienced host staff. A lot of people walked out that evening and I am sorry to say I was one of them.

So this wasn't my first trip to Bj's, but this was the most impressionable. It is close to my sister's house and makes for convenient dinners with the family. Last night was probably the worst experience we have had at BJ's so far and it left a bit of a sour taste in the mouth.   First off, my husband ordered some pasta with lemon butter sauce, feta, chicken, olive oil, and some other stuff in it. He asked for no tomatoes or red peppers because he is a wuss like that. About 10 minutes after we finally ordered (and I mean finally) the waitress came out and informed him that the kitchen said his meal would be bland without the tomatoes and it would not be the same dish at all, then asked him if he wanted to order something else. After the award winning sales pitch he just received he said of course and asked for a menu. The waitress then disappeared, took another table's drink order, then made her way back with a menu.   Secondly, our waitress was spacey, non existent, and never really checked up on us. Typically I would not be a stickler for something like that but one of the people in our party was given entirely the wrong meal. Somehow fettuccine Alfredo with blackened chicken turned into grilled chicken pasta with broccoli. The manager came and apologized but that was 15 minutes after the food runner went back into the kitchen to see about the order. Our waitress passed our table 4-5 times during this time and never once asked why a large plate of food sat untouched and every person in our table was turning to make eye contact. She never even apologized for the mix up later.   Then they brought my niece's food was brought out about 20 minutes before our food. We were a little concerned when our food did not follow and then about 10 minutes later the waitress came to explain that she sent it out early since "kids eat slow." In reality it just lead to my niece being finished with her food before the adults and had plenty of time to frolic in the left over mac and cheese.   Finally, when the bills were brought out she boasted that she did not charge our table for our non alcoholic beverages (an ice tea and sprite) and acted as if she had done us a favor. I would of much rather preferred that I didn't have to flag her down to ask for a beer (which ended up being watered down) and management would of taken some sort of responsibility for the long wait (35-40 minutes for food- pasta and a burger), poor customer service, and total mess up on an order.

It's finally open!    After months of delays the Surprise Kokopelli Winery is finally open. I am a fan of Kokopelli and their wine. The best wine ever, no, but I enjoy sweeter wines on occassion and they have a decent selection to chose from.   The new bistro is huge. It has a separate tasting room that can be reserved, a little gift shop set up behind the hostess stand, and a huge half circle bar that opens up to the two dining areas. The menu is about 3 times bigger than the chandler location, which is nice, everyone needs more variety. My husband has tried the fish and chips (tilapia and sweet potato fries) and enjoyed them. I have had their cordon bleu pasta and their pot roast, both were tasty.  Wine will run you 6-7 dollars a glass, but they do have happy hour 3-4, and 8-close most nights. Live music is offered thursday- saturday.  It is not going to win everyone over, but it is just so nice to have variety in Surprise, that they are going to do well, especially since wine + "active adults"= cash flow.

I have only been to Sens once, but it definitely made its impression.  To my husbands disappointment I am not a huge fan of Asian food. I enjoy it, but I don't live for it. My husband on the other hand could eat it morning noon and night. Another contrast of our relationship is his love for all things seafood, and my resistance to eat anything that didn't grown up on land. Despite these two short comings of my own, I was able to thoroughly enjoy Sens.   I scanned the menu for everything chicken, beef, or pork and made my decisions from that. I ended up with the 5 spiced wings, the spicy wonton, and the sugar cane pork. I have to admit I could of probably eaten about 50 of the spicy wonton. Crispy and delicious, and not to spicy for my pregnant palette.  The five spiced wings did not wow me and I ended up passing them along to the husband who devoured them. The wing itself lacked the crisp in the skin that I was looking for. The sugar can pork was interesting it was like a meat ball formed around a stick of sugar cane.I am not a pro at ordering tapas- I never know how much I really need to order. 3 plates ended up being more than I could handle, thankfully my husband was there to help.   This is a great place to enjoy a drink with friends, order for the table, and settle in to share the experience.

My first visit to Hanny's was on New Years Eve and I have to start off saying that I did not try there food so my review is solely based off of visiting this establishment as a bar.   The interior of Hanny's is amazing. The modern elements and atmosphere is different than any other place I have visited in Phoenix. The bar is large and central and there are plenty of places to sit, lounge, hide, or socialize. The restrooms are upstairs, which could be troublesome as the night progresses, but thankfully they do have an elevator for those of use who are not steady on heels after a few drinks. The service at the bar was slow, but it was busy and having good company helped me forget that I was without drink. The long islands are strong, very strong, 2 day hang over strong- but they did the trick.   Hanny's is the type of place I would take out of town friends to show them that Phoenix is a city on the rise and not just a Hard Rock Cafe and Hooters type of town. I think that with time some of the other reviewers issues will work out and I hope that with the light rail business will continue to flourish for them. Hanny's has potential and I am curious to return and try food.

I loved Side Bar!  The music, the decor, and the ability to get a drink quickly no matter how busy they seemed moves this lounge high up on my list of downtown favorites. I was part of a birthday party and we had reserved a couch area which turned out to be a great thing. While the bar itself was not busy when we got there, the place did eventually fill up and our large party was able to mingle and move about but still had seating as the night progressed and heals became more uncomfortable. My lovely husband served as my waiter throughout the night and despite a full bar, he never had a problem getting a drink or getting the bartenders attention.   Cannot wait to go back!

I really hate this place.   As much as I enjoy wings and think that they have a good selection of sauces, the service is always such a turn off at this location. Every time we are there, regardless if they are busy, we get the slowest service ever. Drinks go unfilled, mistakes are made with the orders, and you start to feel forgotten in general. It really should not take an hour and a half to eat at a place that 99% of their menu is fried and served in paper boats. Not to mention the fact that they charge for ranch dressing ($.40). Last time a mistake was made in our order it almost turned into an argument with the waitress who eventually pulled the manager over. We asked for boneless and got bone in- it should of been a simple fix not a confrontation.   My husband continues to want to go back so I guess I will continue to begrudgingly go back.

I am actually really liked this place. Despite the reviews being a little mixed we decided to stop in and try it for an after work happy hour. During happy hour their aps are half off which was an instant positive in my book. I tried both the corn beef tacos and the Irish quesadilla and enjoyed both. The tacos took my by surprise in a good way and definitely left an impression since I keep thinking about them every time we pass. Their nutella brownie was delicious and overall our service was very friendly.   My only complaint was that as the afternoon progressed our waitress disappeared. She forgot a cider refill and messed up the bill a bit, but it was obvious she was stretched a little thin. Some of the people in my party did not enjoy their apps as much as I did mine so I was glad I made the choices I did. I definitely see us coming back and trying out more of the menu.

The Brookside has 2 very important things:  1) Cold beer served in frosty glasses  2) Huge variety on their menu  Their happy hour is nice, I just wished it went longer for those of us getting off of work around 4 pm.

OK, I would like to first start off by saying if a business is going to put fake reviews up for themselves, at least say something different each time. I do not think a GM has been mentioned this much, ever, within the same day by people with stock Microsoft photo gallery images.   Secondly, I gave Brookside II a chance and it made me miss Brookside I- big time. My beer was still cold (a plus) but the menu is severely limited (compared to the novel and diverse menu of the first Brookside) to whatever they can purchase in bulk and deep fry. I could understand this choice if our food was served quickly and it tasted decent, but they failed in both of those areas. For fried mushrooms, chips and salsa, and chicken tenders the members in my party waited probably about 30 minutes. The advertise fresh made tortillas chips but serve it with pace picante. Their nachos were cheese sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, and jalapenos, served almost 30 minutes after ordered) for $6.99. My friend ordered the fried cod (see the fried theme) and took two bites and decided to be done.   I am not saying that the food at a sports bar should be top notch, but at least good enough to satisfy the need/craving for bar food. Also I think if your menu is going to be largely deep fried based then the food should at least be prompt. Our waitress was the only one on the floor and she was spread too thin and it was obvious.   I might go back to grab a beer if I had to meet someone, but as for making an appearance on my own initiative, probably not.

So Garduno's is now Camarones and from what I can tell the only difference is the name.   The building itself is very nice. Multiple seating areas, a cute patio bar as you enter and even an sun room (where we sat) that looks like you could open the windows and let fresh air in if desired. The menu has the standards on there fajitas, chimis, enchiladas, combination plates, etc. They even have steaks, some seafood options, and the standard hamburger (that all chain Mexican restaurants feel they need to have for our out of town company from the Midwest that is not used to the "spice"). The prices are a bit steep for what you end up getting in my opinion. The portion sizes were large, but the flavor was lacking. I shared a "fiesta platter" with my mom trying to get a feel for the food and other than the red chili pork burrito, ever thing else was bland. The chicken in the quesadilla was just boiled chicken. I would of liked some chile or onion laced within to try and amp up the flavor but no such luck. The rolled tacos were just as bland and not much different from the kind you find in your freezer selection. Was it the best choice off the menu? Probably not but I was feeling cheep and not incredibly hungry so spending 20 bucks on fajitas didn't sound appealing. I thought my meal would be redeemed by service and sophapillas- but our waiter was just OK and my drink sat empty for a while which bugs me and the sophapillas, while hot, lacked cinnamon, sugar or powder sugar, and despite my generous application of honey where still bland in comparison to other places.

It's always a good sign when you want to eat at the same place twice in one week.   Excited for a new Mexican restaurant in Surprise, my husband and I tried Las Fuentes twice this past week. The first time we were lured in with a coupon and I tried the Tostada Grande. It was more like a taco salad lax on the lettuce. It had a fried flour tortilla, a layer of beans, shredded beef, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream. It was indeed "grande" and hit the spot. Fast forward a few nights later and I sent the hubby out to get something to bring back for dinner. We decided to try their "Grande platter for two" and we were not disappointed. Once again the servings were large and the food was tasty. We were particularly impressed with the enchiladas and the chicken tostada.   The salsa tastes very similar to Macayos, but other than that the food definitely has a little bit more love put into it that some of the other choices around town.

Delicious!  I have never been to the Carolina's downtown, so this was my first experience with the place. I had some friends raving about their tortillas and talking about how they are the only ones they will use anymore, so of course my interest was peaked.  This combined with all the rave reviews and me and the husband decided to take the short trip this past Wednesday.  The locations was clean, and the employees were polite. The menu is extensive so I caved and went with the number 9 since it had rave reviews in a previous review. The beans and rice were very tasty and the tacos tasted better than any other "taco stand" joint I have been to and best of all were not loaded with grease. The tortillas used in the tacos were thin and crunchy and boy did the NOT skip on the cheese. The husband ordered a chimichunga and he was pleased to find out  that it was only chicken inside (he has texture issues with onions and chilis) and he was over the moon with the "non chunky" salsa with a good kick to it. We tried a cheese tortilla (once again not super greasy at all) and a buttered tortilla. Next time we would do either a cheese tortilla or the chips, not both. We really did end up over ordering but for under $20 and lunch for the hubs the next day we really couldn't complain.  We will be back, soon I hope. This is definitely on the guilty pleasure list.

Add me to the list of "because of Christine's glowing review..."   Having my house professionally cleaned has been a dream of mine for a few years now. Having company come in from the east coast and a beyond full plate of work and finishing my masters, my husband decided to give in and humor me.   All communications were prompt and professional. The price was great for the piece of mind. Knowing that they had cleaned the house of someone I know was a huge weight off of my shoulders. And most importantly they did a great job! They dealt with my annoying dogs and the muddy mess they had created with no complaints. Even though it has been a few weeks since they were here, we can still see their presence through the polished chrome in the bathroom and the dustless wine bar.

3.5 stars  The overly blue decor did not bug me, as it has some previous reviews, but I will admit the space is lacking a bit. The service was super friendly and attentive, but then again there were only 2 other tables there when we arrived, so a drink never went empty which is always nice.  I love the build your own concept for a burger. I love burgers and it is nice to have creative control. I also really liked that they had sharp cheddar as a cheese option, I really love sharp cheddar on a burger. I went with the standard Angus and the burger was juicy and tender. I asked for medium and I ended up with medium well, but it was still good. The husband went with the Kobe Beef and couldn't pick out a huge difference between his and mine- something to consider if you don't feel like spending $3 more.  My biggest concern are the fries. I went with regular fries, and maybe I am becoming a fry snob, but I wish that they were fresh cut. I knew right off the bat that they were from a freezer bag and while they weren't bad, I would of loved some fresh cut potatoes with a bit of skin- it would of added to the whole experience for me.  Overall tasty burger with a lot of options. I hope they start picking up with business, it is nice to have a good burger place nearby.

I really, really love this office.  Upon having my first pregnancy confirmed by my general practitioner, a call to Advance Care and I had an appointment 10 min later in their office. That day I only met with a nurse (pregnancy test, and basic information) but I left feeling 100% confident in the care I would receive. Since then every experience from the front desk, the ultrasound tech, Sandra (the NP) and Dr. Newman, and I have never left that office without feeling taken care of and educated. Their on staff lab technician is wonderful as well and always finds a vein while other struggle and bruise me. I know the office has gone through the process of loosing 2 doctors, but you would never be able to tell.  Another highlight is the online patient portal where I have access to lab results and the option to email a nurse to ask questions. I have always receive responses within 24hrs and recently even got a phone call in return because :I could tell you needed to hear a voice from all of your questions."  I really cannot say enough good things- for the first time in a long time my experiences with a Dr.'s office has not ended with long wait times, insurance confusions, and that rushed over feeling with unanswered questions. They really go out of their way to take care of you and that is a great feeling.

Total fan here- regular in the making for sure.   A little less than a month after discovering this place we have become weekly visitors. The layout is great and the patio is top notch. Great seating with a fire pit creates multiple opportunities for causal sitting arrangements, great for conversations. The patio even has bar access which is a really nice convenience. The inside is a lot larger than you would think with multiple types of seating including booths, tables, pub tables and ample bar seating.  Beer on draft runs you about $4 and this includes a tall can of Strongbow Cider (love that stuff). The menu has a good variety of Irish fare and burgers. For $9, I can get a really good burger complete with rasher, sauteed leeks and Irish whiskey aioli, chips, and a cup of soup. They have 4 standard soups and the 2 we have sampled have been delicious. The potato leek is my favorite- creamy with potato chunks and rasher bits- so good for a cold day. I really want to try other things on the menu but my love for their burger has prevented me from doing so. The husband get the fish and chips sandwich and sings its praises to everyone we tell about the Wolfhound.  With live entertainment, live trivia, and strategically placed big screens this place satisfies all of our needs for a great local pub- plus the food is awesome.

This has become our go-to spot. With team trivia every Wednesday we are here at least once a week. The servers recognize us and are always friendly. The corn beef/Rubens are delish and I love the laid back environment. They always have full tables which must be a sign that they are doing something right! I encourage anyone in the area to stop in and give them a try!

If you like boneless wings with a million sauce options this is a Buffalo Wild Wings alternative for you.  The husband and i decided to try out Hurricane's a few weeks ago and meh is all I can really say. My husband appreciated the fact that they were able to make a proper buffalo chicken sandwich (chicken breast is completely tossed in wing sauce) but I was left questioning whether or not the chicken in their chicken chili was really chicken- or pressed chicken pieces with chicken flavoring. The service was ok but like the food, nothing to write home about.  If dragged here again I would probably go with the intention to drink- not eat.

Other than the fact that it is not in a diner shaped building- there isn't much difference between 5 & Diner Delux and the regular 5  & Diner.  The menus are pretty much the same with standard diner fare. The big difference is supposed to be that they prep there own food, but I couldn't really feel the extra love in my bacon cheeseburger.  I guess the biggest dissapointment was the fact that my chocolate shake was made with vanilla icecream and chocolate syrup. This produces the same flavor as a fast food shake and the steep price of $4.49. A chocolate shakemade with chocolate ice cream is just more authentic and really what this pregnant lady was craving at the time.

I have mixed feelings on the Mellow Mushroom. The pretzels we tried were really good, the pizza however not so much. The crust was different, but the sauce and the cheese just felt wrong. Maybe I have been spoiled with good pizza lately, but this is not a place I would return to grab a pie.  Their sandwiches and salads sound good, but even more appealing is the happy hour deals. Great beer list and half off? Enough of a pull to get me to return but I will stay away from the pizza on future visits.

Delicious!  Stopped by after hearing raves from my sister and was definitely not disappointed! We had the carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and it was the perfect balance. The cream cheese frosting was not at all overwhelming and the cake was most and rich. I can see getting a Sugar Daddy craving every time I am in the area!

I am usually not a fan of restaurants with gift shops inside of them, but I must admit I am a fan of Saddle Ranch. This is perhaps one of the best people watching locations on the west side simply for the fact that they have a mechanical bull. For some reason this device attracts women with skimpy shirts and fake boobs like bees to honey. While sipping on my ginormous long island ice tea, I could not help but utterly enjoy watching people get tossed from the bull, in many instances it was pure comedy. I have yet to eat here but my parents have on two occasions and have had wonderful experiences. The first time they went there they had to wait for a table and the manager walked them over to the bar and bought them a drink. The manager obviously understood that a free bloody mary was the way to my mother's heart and a sure fire way to win repeat business.

Yum!  We were first introduced to Bueno Burger at The Taste of Glendale. There they served a pulled pork sandwich that stuck in my memory and today I just had to taste it again.  When we arrived I got a little worried because I did not see a pulled pork sandwich on the menu board but to my relief I saw it on a paper menu with "seasonal item" written below it. I asked and sure enough they were able to satisfy my craving. Pulled pork in a mild bbq sauce with cilantro slaw on top. typically I am not a major slaw fan, but the seasoning in this one is a perfect addition to the sandwich. It was as good as I remembered and I can only hope that next  time we go back it will be in "season." The husband had a burger "Glendale Style" which had bacon, mushrooms, horseradish sauce, and swiss cheese. For under 20 bucks we were both stuffed and satisfied walking out the door and felt it was overall a pleasant experience. We will be back :)

Gorgeous!!!  Maricopa County has opened up a new library branch in the west valley and it really puts the other branches to shame. Literally right outside of the park gates for the White Tanks Mountain Preserve this modern building stands out and fits right into the desert surroundings. When you enter the actual library your eyes are immediately drawn to the floor to ceiling windows that line the west wall. you feel like you are in the middle of the desert surrounded by wildflowers and cacti. The facility itself is well laid out with plenty of computers, seating, and study rooms. The major bonus is that since it is a new branch- all the books are new! You still get to hear the binding crack open for the first time and the whole place has a new book smell about it. Special care has been taken to compliment the natural beauty surrounding it and is partially powered by solar panels. It may be a further drive for us (I could walk to the Northwest Branch) but honestly it is worth it.

There is not much I don't like about Windsor. The decor hooked me immediately, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the vibe is just a good one.  I have had the cheddar fondue twice and I love the pretzel bread. The porkwich is amazing. The mac and cheese is ok, not the best, but better than most, and the church potatoes are a nice change of pace.  The fact that you can round out your experience with a trip to Churn makes this a regular on my list of favorites in mid town.

Before a couple of weeks ago, Surprise Animal Hospital was just the place we went to pick up our cat's special food. They had always been pleasant and are open 7 days a week which is a huge convenience.   A few weeks ago, my parents dog fell ill (she was 12 years old). After a trip to the emergency vet we realized her time was nearing the end so I was not surprised when my mom called me on a Sunday morning telling me that it was "that time" for Daisy. My parents hate their vet, with a passion, so they asked me to help them find a place with Sunday hours. I immediately remembered that Surprise AH was open Sunday and we had always had a good experience. Despite the horrible conditions in which we had to go there, I have never had a better experience with a vet. The whole staff was wonderful. We were over 30 minutes early for our appointment but they put us right in a room and the vet was in there within 10 minutes. She examined our sweet Daisy and confirmed that it was indeed time and took the time to explain everything to my mother and I. They allowed us to stay in the room as Daisy was put to rest and the vet tech held my hand and rubbed my back in an effort to comfort me. The vet commented that it seemed that Daisy was a very loved pet, and seriously that was the best possible thing to say after we made such a painful decision. The vet tech offered to make a paw print for us (free of charge) and we were not expecting anything special. When I got the call a few days after that the print was done I was impressed to see that the print was in clay not plaster and they have pressed clay daisies around the print and etched her name in it. It was such a sweet gesture. The final rave was the sympathy card I just received in the mail. It was a personal message from the vet and once again just another extremely thoughtful touch.   Like I said, this was not the most ideal situation to be reviewing this vet, but the care and compassion this office showed us in this difficult time far exceeded any expectations I ever had.
