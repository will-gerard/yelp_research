This place is OK. When I first met my brother here, we were seated right away which is always nice, but i kinda felt rushed to order. We were given maybe 3 minutes to decide what we wanted. As soon as the lady came up we gave her our order and she grabs the menu out of my hand before I could ask her a question. Like she was in a rush..it wasn't even busy, which puzzled me a bit. Anyways, lets get down to the sushi..I for one am a big sushi snob. I know my sushi. From the freshness to the flavor, I know what's good and what isn't. We got our rolls and mackerel. Sadly, the rolls were small and covered in sauce. Not much fish in the rolls (disappointing.)..It was like the rice was choking the fish in the roll..too much of it.  The mackerel was very dry, and didn't really have flavor. Would I come back here?..most likely not. What attracted me to this place was the price, but it goes to show you, you really do get what you pay for. For you sushi lovers out there, I would look else where. This place didn't hit the spot for me.  Kind of funny, I was viewing the photos from other yelpers and my sushi looked nothing like their photos. Maybe it was just a bad night. If my rolls looked like how theirs looked then i might consider going back..

The best carne asada burrito ever! The tamales "enchilada style" melt in your mouth. So good and such quality!

Fresh..Delicious & exceptional customer service! This food truck came to our community. First bite, I almost melted..the tacos I ordered were so goooood! The coleslaw was so fresh, crunchy and full of flavor! The meat was very tender and just all around yum! I hope they come by again!

Definitely has a beautiful atmosphere. I can't comment on the food because I just stopped in for a few drinks at the bar with some friends. So it was my first time there, had a wells rum & diet coke...the coke ended up being flat. Sadly, the bartender replaced it with another, still was flat, but didn't taste as strong as the first one. I then asked for a beer for "cheap sake" and the bartender ended up giving me the largest one? I guess that's automatic when you don't specify. Anywho, I ended up spending about 18 dollars on 2 drinks, which is a little excessive for my liking. I will come back to try the food, but I will not be drinking there ;)
