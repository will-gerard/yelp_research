This place is absolutely wonderful!  I called for an appointment and was scheduled for 30 mins later :) I walked in 10 mins early and was seated for my pedicure right away! I forgot to get the lady's name, but she was great and even managed my request of stars on my big toe :) Suzie did an amazing job with my white tip gel manicure, it's the best I've ever had!  With the 10% off for checking in on yelp it was decently priced. I will be back.

i went to this place because of their good reviews here on yelp... im honestly wondering if i went to the wrong place. i called 15 minutes before me and my mom headed in they said they would be able to take us both right away once we got there we waited 15 minutes before they even started my moms full set then i had to wait another 10 minutes for them to start my manicure why does it seem like all nail places do this? if you cant take me right away when i ask, please dont LIE just to get me to come there. i got white tips and im not too impressed. there are bubbles all through their top coat and the guy couldnt even cut/file my nails evenly i definitely will NOT be back. wish i could give ZERO stars

My favorite chinese place in mesa! The service is great. The food presentation is impressing, and most importantly, it tastes amazing! The price is average for chinese. All in all a great place for your next chinese meal!

me and my boyfriend ate here for the first time last night and all i can say is O!M!G! the food was some of the best Ive ever had and for a Wednesday night the place was pretty busy! from the yummy fresh warm bread, to the salad with the awesome shaved tomato pieces, to my HOMEMADE chicken alfredo which was most definitely the best Ive ever had in my life, and the raspberry cheesecake, everything was just absolutely amazing the service was great and the wine selection was HUGE! they were doing wine tasting for $18 each, i had to work today or i would have been all for it! i joined their E-Mail club so they will notify me next time it happens :) overall this place is a total surprise for being located where it is i cant wait to have an excuse to go back again now time to heat up the leftovers and have some lunch!

this place is ridiculous. ive had pretty mediocre food from here a few times, but its down the street from my house so i think i just keep hoping it will get better. The Carne Asada is totally bland. And their quesadillas are practically inedible. The one good thing is their salsa and bean dip.  So I just called to place a take out order for a side of bean dip. The woman informed me that chips do NOT come with the bean dip and it would be $1.99 extra for them (Do most people eat bean dip WITHOUT chips?). Ok. Fine. I will pay the $1.99. Then i ask if salsa is included with the cost of chips, to which she replies no, salsa is extra as well. I hung up. Everything they were trying to charge me for is FREE if i was going to sit there and eat my bean dip!   I think i have finally given up on this place just go to cheba hut next door ;)

Just ordered Ottos for the first time after finding it here on yelp. The pizza was cheap! and got here fast (under 30 minutes)! most importantly it was AMAZING! this is definitely my new favorite delivery place around campus. I thought it was awesome that they dont charge a delivery fee. i was able to tip $4 and know that the driver was going to get it all! plus $12 for an xlarge cheese pizza is a great deal!  Ottos has definitely found a repeat customer in me  *edited 1/23/11* i just moved to texas and the one thing i havent been able to find is pizza as good as this places was!  i must have ordered from them at least 30 times after writing my 1st review before leaving the state!

I absolutely love this place!  I've been there twice this week!  The jerk chicken is absolutely yummy! But honestly everything on the menu that I've tried so far is great!  Ordering for first timers is a little confusing, but if you go up to the guy at the counter on the left he will help u out and give u some samples :) By my second visit I knew the deal and was able to get in and out a lot faster. The snickerdoodle cookie was the bomb, and I tried a special cookie yesterday that was chocolatey and soooo gooooood!  I can't wait to be back in AZ so I can go back to this place!

Wish I could give zero stars. This place sucks. My sandwich was horrible, there was sauce all over it even though I ordered no sauce, there was a tiny sliver of avocado even though I paid extra for avocado on my sandwich.  They were busy and I understand that, but as a new customer, I will not be back due to this mess up.

This was literally the worst Mexican food I've ever had in Arizona. We walked in and ordered two burritos to go, one of them was just a simple bean and cheese. It took 45 minutes to get our food and the staff didn't seem apologetic at all. To make matters worse once we got home and took our first bite I was not impressed. Overall it was edible, but not good at all. Just to go filibertos...

Wish i could give ZERO stars I took the previous yelpers advice and scored a groupon for this place for dinner tonight From the second we walked in the door I know this was not going to be a good experience. We walked in and there was no staff in sight, we decided to seat ourselves. 5 minutes later the girl came over with some water, with no ice, and said she would be right back. no hello and she didnt even bother to ask us if we wanted anything else to drink besides water. 10 mins later she finally came back over and took our order.  it took 14 minutes from the time we ordered for us to receive our crab wontons which came out extremely greasy and seemed to be missing the crab.  22 minutes after ordering my drunken noodles came out, and after having to ask for silverware to eat i noticed they were seriously lacking some veggies... the worst part of this meal is probably the fact that my boyfriends green curry did not come out until 14 minutes after i had received my entree! i was almost done eating when it did come out! then to top everything off, the eggrolls we had ordered came out LAST, 42 minutes after first placing the order...and were full of grease and burnt to a crisp! now if all that wasnt bad enough, this next part is what really gets me... i used a $30 groupon tonight...everything we had totaled to around $30... then she comes over with a bill saying we still owe $8 for gratuity. I tell her I'm not paying a penny more than that groupon and tell her that if i hadnt had that groupon, which was only good tonight, i wouldnt have even bothered staying for the whole meal. She even tried to get the ONLY other customer in the place involved in our argument! then she proceeds to follow us out the door, screaming at me telling me im cheap, and throws the dish with the sweet and sour sauce out the door in front of me!! i will NEVER be back and will be telling everyone i know about this horrific and somewhat comical experience... No wonder this place has to offer groupons all the time, they wouldnt have ANY customers anywise!  AFTER POSTING THIS REVIEW I RECEIVED THESE MESSAGES FROM THEM: "i \you horrible cheap person ....you know we are busy and you not kindness we have all night nice people ,except you  if you don t want to wait just go ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,e kewewwwwww why you dont tell everyone  how you cheap   e kkkk"  and  "i will put  your pic. in front my door and tell everyone you not  pay money ok"  super professional!

We took our second trip to this place today and i was a little disappointed with the service so i had to take away a star. Besides the lack of urgency I got from every employee in the place their food always tastes great. Unfortunately today they served me sunny side up eggs instead of over hard so i had to wait an additional 5 minutes while everyone else at my table ate, but once my food did come, cooked properly, it was tasty! overall this is a great place to grab some breakfast until 4pm any day of the week! i havent tried anything on their lunch or dinner menu, but i plan to go back soon so i can!

Everytime I'm in town I find an excuse to use this company. So far they've provided amazing service for a bachelorette party, a holiday light tour, and a birthday party. Every experience outdoes the last! The vehicles are always beautiful, fully stocked and our driver is always well prepared, very professional and extremely attentive to our needs. I can't wait to be back in September to head out and have some fun in the hummer limo again!
