Absolutely HORRIBLE experience!!! Refusing to take 3 separate orders over the phone because it's an inconvenience to their walk in customers! What's the difference if 3 separate people call in??? I will never order from this place again! Completely rude individuals working here that have no common sense and do not understand what customer service is!!!! I dont even give this place the one star this review forced me to give!!!!
