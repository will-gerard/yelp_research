This vet treats you with personal service. They are reasonably priced. For example, another vet wanted over$800 for a dental cleaning for my Dane and they this vet was only about $200. We have been going for years. They have fit me in on an emergency before. Most of my friends with Danes go here too. My visit today for a checkup and rabies shot was $25. The staff is always very friendly and treat your dog like it was their own. The best thing about them too is that they will allow you in the back to be with your dog during a procedure if you desire. When my girl was having her hips x-rayed for breeding purposes, they asked me to come back and be with her while they put her under, they let  E watch everything and explained what was going to happen and then let me stay with her while she was coming out of anestesia. All around great vet.

Owners are very nice. Place is clean. Way cheaper than water delivery. My kids like to go get Thrifty ice cream here.

Can't get more authentic than this. Polish family runs the place and makes all their own meats and sausage. They carry many crackers, condiments, and other imported goods from Poland, etc. They also make a decent sandwich for 5 or 6 bucks. Warning! Cash only.

The owners are very nice. They've been here for over 10 years. The shop is clean and they can always get me in without an appointment. They do good work and they always remember me even after years. The only thing I wish is that they would remove more of the dry rough skin on the heals. I still have to do it myself at home.

Been going here for years. Always get the same thing for my husband when kids and I have eaten already. I bring him the mojarra frita and it's always been consistently delicious. People are friendly too.

Got a gel mani & pedi and it turned out great. The best thing about this place is the girls are sweet and kind, and give you a lot of attention, time, and detail. It's like they really care about your nails and you, not like some salons that get you in and out as fast as possible while they talk among themselves while doing your nails. Also, I didn't have an appointment but they were able to get me back in minutes. Price was fair and competitive too. I will be back!

Was it the best ever? Maybe not but we were hungry and everything was extremely hot and fresh. I could barely finish my burger. It was also nice to eat outside near the fountain at night and bring our dog out. So will definitely be back. Not too often though. It is fast food! They lost one star for service mainly because of lack of English knowledge by counter person. Not friendly either.

Located in a very nice spot in the plaza, right next to a fountain, we enjoyed our pedicure on a beautiful day with the french doors open and the sun shining in. It smelled very pretty in the spa, and the girls were very nice. They did a nice job for a fair price.

I will start off telling you I'm a chef, so I expect good food, and I know when food is prepared properly. I am very critical of freshness. I'm used to cooking at home with freshly prepared everything so when I go out, I want something better than I could have made myself. This fell short in many ways. For example, the fresh tomato salsa served with my fajitas was spent. The flavors were all muted and the tomatoes had been chopped at least a day ago, possibly more. You could see they were dark, and breaking down into mush. The fajita meat had a good grilled flavor, but dry and overcooked. I ordered them with chiles for an extra dollar expecting to have them on the sizzling plate with my fajita meat, especially since they advertise their fresh roasted Hatch chiles on site, but instead they were brought a few minutes later after my meal was served, in a separate dish, cold, mushy, looking like they just came out of a can. I asked for fresh lime to squeeze over my meat and overcooked onions, and got brown dry, lime wheels served on the side of my margarita glass instead. And the margaritas! Okay the first one was .99 cents so I'm not going to complain. But the next one was a very large overpriced one that just tasted like watered down cheap margarita mix. My rice was precooked, dry and old, and way too salty. My husband's chimichanga was basically a big burrito covered in some massive amount of sauce, but it was not deep fried as I thought a chimichanga is supposed to be. Or if it was, it wasn't cooked enough because it was mushy. My kids cheese crisp was... lame. My other kid's mini chimis looked appetizing and he liked them, but they ruined the dish by putting this brightly artificially colored red mini tostada bowl on the plate filled with sour cream that had been sitting in the refrigerator either uncovered, or at the wrong temperature because it had a yellowish brown layer of old cream on the top that was just gross. Apparently they make those up ahead of time too with no quality control. Also it was very hot inside the restaurant which worried me about the safety and sanitation of the kitchen. I agree with others that the service was friendly, when they were actually there. I think it's a bit overpriced, for the quality. We spent $115 with tip, but that was two margaritas and one desert, 3 entrees, one app, one kids meal. I'd rather of had Taco Bell. And the chips were no big deal. If you've made chips at home and experienced what they taste like you would never want restaurant ones again. The texture, freshness, flavor can't be beat. I know what you are all thinking. Stay home then and cook. I usually do for just this reason. Oh and one more thing. The apple sopapilla desert was terrible. The pastry dough was chewy, and lacked salt. Tasted like chewy dish rag.

Server not overly friendly but efficient. Chips and salsa complimentary. Not bad salsa but I think it was made from canned tomatoes. Hot day-airconditioning not very cold but I actually prefer that. Warning-the place is small so either come early for dinner or be prepared to wait. The food was good. Authentic, large portions, not bad for the price. For kids, a chicken empanada was perfect at $2. Nicely presented dishes. Service began to slack when the place filled up with one waiter handling the dining room. Would have had a second beer but too late by the time the server came back. Would have had dessert too but again we waited for our check long after we were done. Would definitely come back again and try more dishes just because it's so nice to go somewhere out if the corporate chain world for a change. But if you're looking for super attentive service and can't handle waiting and just relaxing, then be warned. Do not come during their busiest times.

The atmosphere was really nice. Love the outdoor patio with the metal art and concrete/bottle table. Nice change from the chain coffee shop. Customers very friendly and talkative. My drink tasted yummy but it wasn't frozen enough otherwise I'd give them 5 stars.

It's pretty here at night by the fountain and the fire. Restaurants are open a little later than most. And the biggest thrill of all now is that dogs are allowed. That was not the case in past years. And on weekend nights it is better now that Tweens are not allowed unsupervised. I did see some x-rated behavior here before that policy. I'm a mom so most of the stores don't appeal to me but we enjoyed meandering around letting people pet the dog.

Friendly staff. Repeat your order though as English is 2nd language to avoid miscommunication. Food was ok. Pad Thai too clumpy though. But it was easy to find and nice people and food was pretty good.

I have two Great Danes and only wish I had know about this place sooner. Now the hair and mess stays there and somebody else gets to mop up all the water on the floor. I love the constant flow of water/soap like a car wash where I can soap and scrub them all in one. It gets them way cleaner than I could ever do at home. They come home smelling great and hair free until they go out in the backyard a dig a hole and come back in the house with their faces covered in dirt. Oh well, we'll be back next week.

The thing I hate about them is that I can never just get stuff done. They always want to talk to me about more services. One time I took them up on it and it turned out to be the biggest mistake ever. All my accounts were mixed up and I started getting all these service charges. It took over an hour or my time and nothing I was told held up to be true.  Additionally, during the holidays, there were two fraudulent charges made on my account totalling around $200. I filed a claim, they temporarily credited my account, only to take back their credit without notice, causing my bank account to be overdrawn. They refused to believe me that I did not buy insurance from a company I have no policy with, nor did I purchase prescription drugs from some middle eastern county.  On the other hand, they have lots of locations.

I could have made it better myself. It was so generic. The fried rice seemed like days old. The hot and sour soup lacked depth. I would not waste my money again on this place.

The good is that they were able to do the job I needed done, right away. I took in my son's new scout shirts and needed about 12 little patches sewn on for that evening's meeting. They were able to do it, and I was glad to pay the $20 to get it done quickly which gave me a little bit more of my life back. The only bad was that a couple of the award patches were not put on exactly as I had showed the lady, but heck, I don't think she'd ever seen a cub scout shirt before and I didn't pin those last pieces where they were suppsoed to go so she had to go by her memory of where I showed her they went. I will use them again when I gather enough awards to be sewn on to the shirt again, and at that point, I'll just nicely ask her if she can move those couple items over where they belong. No big deal.

The only reason I go here now is to get my power walk in because it's getting too hot outside. It's kind of entertaining to look in the shop windows as I walk by. I get to see weird looking people getting their fortunes told at the psychic shop. Or watch this eyebrow threading thing in progress. There's a store with creepy little child mannequins wearing Indian clothing. How about an indoor glow-golf, or monster bubbles you can run around in? Then there's a convenient store. What? Basically, all the chain stores are dying out and being replaced by weird Chinese knock-off shops, massage services, strange entertainment/amusement stores, and just stuff the general public has no need for.   Then there's the kiosks in the middle. I hate these! The way I deal with them is to wear my big headphones on my head and avoid eye-contact completely and just keep walking by fast. I can see them approaching me out of the corner of my eye, and I can see their lips moving but I just keep walking and ignore them. I know they're talking about me and laughing behind my back to each other when I walk by and ignore them but who cares? They have to stay in this depressing dungeon mall all day. I get to go enjoy my life outside in the world when I'm done.

First of all, there is this one employee there that I can't believe they haven't fired her yet. You have to ask her for a box even though you just purchased 5 or 6 bottles of liquor totalling $200 or more. Ya think??? What an attitude this girl has.  Next, we stopped here yesterday to pick of a bottle of the 1.75 liter Milagro Silver Tequila and to our surprise it was $63 and some odd cents. I thought at first that maybe I was just comparing to Costco's price of $39. But then we went to Total Wine and More at Desert Ridge and found it for $38!!! Geesh! Don't you think that's a bit of a mark-up?  So we won't be going back anytime soon. I'd rather not get ripped off thank you.

I love them too much. Try to limit my visits to once a month because they are just so darn good. Fresh! I have never gotten bad food here. I have always had friendly, fast efficient service. The prices are right, the food is fresh non nonsense straight forward good. I know there's probably 5000 calories in the meal, but plan for the occasion and splurge once in awhile. It's better than McDonalds with a bunch of frozen chemicals.

I do like their food. I like how the kid meals come with something educational instead of some piece of plastic junk. The only thing I would say is for the price, I think their portions could be a little bigger. I am always wanting just a couple more waffle fries.

The food is standard fare, nothing amazing, but not disgusting either. But, I give them four stars because of two reasons. First, the employees are extremely friendly and real. I forgot his name now, but the bald guy with tattoos was so nice. He loved my Great Dane who he said made his day better since he was having a stressful day at work.  So he gave me and my boys a nice discount. I so appreciated that because I had to drive a long way to get there, so it really helped balance out the expense. I noticed the beautiful exposed brick of the historic downtown Mea building too, and it captured my heart and made me wish I lived out there since everything in north east Phoenix is pretty "big box" corporate owned generic strip mall land.  I would definitely go back again because even though it took literally over an hour for our food, I am a patient person and was just hanging out with my dog, friends and family.

Pretty boring sandwich, unless you just really like meat. Service was downright rude. Overheard the server talking smack about us because we were disappointed with our meal. Pricey. Wont be back. Used to go there all the time when they were more authentic.

I would definitely give them a try. I got the large shrimp po'boy and I was stuffed. The fries were hot and fresh and the sandwich was tasty. I tried my aunt's rice and beans and they were really good unlike what I expected from the other reviews I read. The people were very nice and the lunch prices were good. Dinner is more money but maybe they increase the portion size. I'm not sure. Also they give a 20% military discount on the whole order and my aunt has a military I.d. So that worked out. I'd go again for sure.

It is not a Wal-Mart Supercenter such as the one on Northsight, but it does have groceries. I would describe it as a Wal-Mart Mini Supercenter. It has all the departments of the supercenter except the tires, garden center, optical department, and a McDonald's. In some cases I find they carry less inventory or selection. It is only 2 miles from my house, so I go there almost every day. This I feel qualifies my review. The employees know us. If we come without our children, they always ask where they are. They remember our purchases! They ask my kids how their new "whatever" is working out. They ask if you found everything alright, and when you say no, they actually take note of what it was you couldn't find. How do I know this? Because the next day I went back to that same checker and told her I couldn't find Nori sheets and she let me know that she was going to let them know upstairs so they could add it to the request for wasabi powder I asked for yesterday. And the greatest thing that not many people know because they don't advertise it is their ad matching. I bring in the current grocery store ads from the other stores and tell them at the checkout what price the item is on sale for at "Fry's" or "Sprouts" etc, and they give it to me for that price. So, I do the majority of my shopping there. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because I have to buy my seafood elsewhere. All of theirs is frozen except for a small counter, but I don't like the quality level. I find it difficult to find good seafood here in the desert unless I want to pay for it at Whole Foods. There are sometimes special items that I can't find there, so I must go to Food City for a special Mexican herb or spice, or Trader Joe's for a $2.99 basil plant, but for the generic staple items, I think it's my best bet. I can buy groceries, camping supplies, shampoo, school supplies, and clothes all in one stop.

What a great experience! Cori was great! Everyone was "out of their way" friendly. Price was amazing for how long Cori spent with my son's hair! Probably about an hour or more. She listened to what he wanted even though he didn't even really know what he wanted. My sons are a mixture of black & white. I have been trying to cut my kid's hair since they were little and now they are teenagers and need a proper "man" cut. I didn't know where to go because every time I go to a salon or barber in my neighborhood, we are literally turned away. Every one refused to cut their hair because it is thick, long, and curly. I had one woman tell me it would take her about 5 hours to comb it out and she'd have to charge like $300. I tried an upscale barber at Scottsdale Quarter. 2 different stylists came over, assessed the situation and said they were not equipped to handle it and sent us on our way. One of them was a black man so I was sure he'd know what to do. So I gave up for years.   But today my son had reached his tolerance limit with his messed up "mommy cut" hair so I did a search for black + hair + Phoenix and found Lefty's. I went to their website and watched Lefty's story and knew I wanted to go there. I called and they told me to come right in, no appointment necessary. It's a 45 minute drive but worth it! We got in and were greeted by several stylists/barbers. No wait. Place was super crowded, they let me come back with my son and just hang out. Got to enjoy little children and their cuteness, the latest gossip about "Empire", and some laughter. Finally a place that doesn't freak out when I bring my curly-headed sons for a haircut. I'll be going back to have Cori cut my hair too. I have straight caucasian hair but they are great at all hair types.

I found Jonathan and Julie over a year ago because they were the only ones that stocked a particular brand of dog food near me. I loved the fact that I was supporting a local business. They have been great in every way. They are full of integrity and only carry products that they have personal knowledge of. They have gone out of their way to deliver dog food for me once a week, and now they have opened up their store! I love going to visit them and bringing one of my dogs with me to play about that store as I visit and talk over products for them. Today was a real "treat" because I have been looking for a rawhide product or something similar that would last a long time with my 3 big dogs, two of them being Danes. I had all but given up. But today one of my Danes found a "SUPER RAWHIDE" hiding in the corner and chewed on it for like 45 minutes and it held up! No chunks were bitten off, no choking, no puking up the pieces. I was so happy when Jonathan told me these were special rawhides that he decided to carry after learning that they were the only ones made in the U.S., and they don't tear apart like the others do. And it was reasonably priced. I bought it and they have all been playing with the entire evening and it is still intact, with just the end chewed up like a nub. This a a wonderful couple who love animals and are just great caring people all around. They will help you with whatever you need and only carry the very best for your pet.

Exceptionally friendly owners. Great homemade authentic food. I had a Cuban sandwich that was perfect. He even makes the guacamole. Latte was great too. The outdoor seating area was spacious and clean. Wish it was closer to my house. I'd go everyday.

I agree with the previous reviewer. It seems like a great concept but not executed well. It seemed barely surviving when I went in there with a few token scrawny pieces of organic produce, but the rest was pretty much stuff I could find at any grocery store. Cans of Coca Cola? Really?

I see absolutely nothing wrong with this place. It is more expensive than McDonald's but have you compared the price of organic ground beef to multi-cow chubs at your local grocery store lately? And wait, isn't Five Guys about the same price?   I found the taste to be very good actually. I love the brioche bun. I tasted every bit of coal/wood fire in my burger. I do prefer mine a bit less done, but I didn't ask if it could be cooked to a different temp. I love the bib lettuce instead of iceburg. My salad was tasty with a very good basil avocado dressing and nicely appointed with deseeded and peeled cucumbers and grape tomatoes. And not overly dressed. I tasted my husband's french fries. They were hot and fresh, I agree nothing unique, but good quality. The soda fountain is unique in that it serves cane sugar sweetened soda. Much better than HFCS. And yes I'm sure more expensive.  The service was very attentive, the place was clean, and very "green" feeling. They even use L.E.D. lighting.  In summary, if you're looking for somewhere to eat cheap, and gorge yourself silly, and could care less about your carbon footprint, then this may not be your thing. But if you're concerned about the quality of your ground beef and want a great tasting burger that fits into your healthy diet, then I think you'll appreciate what they are offering here.

I've been holding back on my review until now because I wanted to give it some time to see how it was going to work for me. After 5.5 weeks, I can say that I have achieved darn good results considering my profile. I'm a 44 yr. old mom of three who just finished CULINARY school of all things for God's sake. Needless to say, I gained a bit of weight from eating my schoolwoork and late night studying.  I had a minimum total of at least 90 lbs to shed and have absolutely no muscle. I hate exercise and I love to eat good food. I've never liked lifting weights and though the treadmill was my only option.  So here I am just a little over a month over joining, and turns out I actually like lifting weights now. The machine is better than a human personal trainer because it never forgets a single move. It knows how well or not you did last time. It knows how much weight to give you, how many reps are just right for you, and detects your range of motion which is saved for you on your little USB drive. And the best thing is that at the end of your workout, you see how many Weight Watchers points you just earned, and your KOKO score! It's like a little kid working hard for those stickers. I can't wait to reach 50,000 points to get my new orange lanyard to hold my USB drive.  End results: Total weight loss since beginning the program is 9 lbs, strength gain 22%. I'm impressed. It's obviously working and I had all but given up hope that anything would ever work for me.   If you're worried about the price, don't be. There are no big sign up fees except the cost of your special USB card and your security card to get in after hours. The club is small and personal. It's clean, and smells new. The owners are really nice and motivating when you need it. And if you'd rather work out late night when it's nice and quiet, you have access up until 11pm when it feels like you have your own private gym. I also like the fact that you stay one machine and just change out the attachments a bit instead of moving from station to station. It's so easy! You have to stop in and see for yourself. I recommend it wholeheartedly.

I will start out by admitting I judge harshly. That being said, the main reason I give it such a low rating is the mussels were spoiled! I love mussels with a nice piece of bread to soak up the juice. But if the cooks didn't smell the fowl smell these dead mussels were giving off, then they should not be in the kitchen. I'm not the one who ordered them, so it wasn't my place to send them back or complain, and didn't want to cause a scene in front of my husband and his business associates, but oh my. It was bad. I spit it out and wiped my tongue with a napkin.   My husband ordered scallops. 3 scallops with a swoosh of cauliflower puree, $25??? And they were undercooked!  My spaghetti and meatballs? Well, I think the meatballs were premade, frozen, then microwaved to reheat. They were hard and rubbery. I could not cut them with the fork.  The server was nice. But I don't see why anyone would want to spend so much money for this food when you could make it so much better yourself. Well maybe you hate cooking. I understand. Call me. I'll make it for you, fresh, in your home.

Wish we would have tried this place a long time ago. I had never heard of it before. But it sure is nice to have a fast casual fish place to go to in our own neighborhood. Love the fried coconut shrimp and fish and chips, but they also have some healthier options of grilled fish sandwiches which I will try next time we go. The service has always been excellent and friendly, and the food is hot fresh and delicious. I also love the outdoor seating in the whole place is spotless.

This place is the best bike shop we've ever been too. One, they're open pretty late. Two, they spend all the time in the world with you even if you're not spending the big bucks. They were so nice to my son and got him the parts he really needed. Three, They let my big great dane come in the store. Four, the place is beautiful. Five, they have some really nice merchandise in stock and can pretty much get you whatever you want. And lastly, I was impressed as heck at the young kid that was taking care of us. He was so polite. He knew how to handle himself professionally and spoke very confidently, He was knowledgeable, personable and thorough. I see some not so good reviews here saying the opposite of what I said. Who knows why some have had bad experiences and others have had good ones. But the things I said were good are some of the same exact things that the other good reviews have said so you know there must be some truth to it.

Good: They were very friendly and the store is new and clean with a nice raised outdoor patio and it's next to Starbucks.   Not good: $5 for a BLT. Nothing else. Not what I was expecting at all. Basically a burger without the burger. Cold dry bun. 1 slice of tomato. Iceberg lettuce. Old tasting crumbly hard bacon. No mayo. No condiments of any kind. Dry, boring, overpriced, unsatisfying. Felt like they just figured out a way to throw together their leftover ingredients without a burger and make it sound like something good and make a huge profit off ingredients that cost them a quarter.

Wow! Impressive for a Denny's. Best one I've ever gone too. It's brand new, spotless, modern and retro, the customer service and professionalism was spot on, which is not what I've come to expect at Denny's but admittedly, that's always been part of the fun of going there.   The food was hot, fresh, and tasty and nicely presented. You can get the mix and match soda pop flavors here. My son had a great strawberry shake. The server was happy to accommodate his request of no eggs, extra French toast. And our late night family is happy to have a 24 hour place to eat that's not a bar or in a neighborhood where you might get mugged or worse.    Wish my onion ring portion would have been just a bit larger, not that I need them or anything, but they were really good and I think I only got five.

It's just so...big. And most of what's in here is not even food! And all I wanted was some apples and eggs. I had to walk a mile to get back to the eggs. And no free range selection? The apples were all stacked beautifully, but maybe that's why they were all like $1.49 /lb. I know this is one of the most popular grocery stores, but I also see why most people eat so poorly if this is what's put in front of them. The store was clean and neat though.
