Over $10 for a pint of beer (at least it's Goose Island?). I guess that $4 shot they try to add to every round might be a steal after all.   They don't serve food and apparently don't clean the tables either, and yet this place is hopping, probably because it's the only place that serves alcohol at this end of the Southwest gates.   Not gonna lie, though. It's entertaining sitting at the bar, watching the bartender Gary work the crowd as people realize they're going to get charged nearly $11 for a beer, or better yet, $34 for two Jäger bombs. That's gotta hurt.

Note to self: GO HERE the next time I'm peckish and waiting out a hellish Phoenix layover. La Grande Orange offers fresh food, lots of veggie options, and a friendly, efficient staff. There's also great seating for people watching, and a fantastic beer list that offers various local choices.

It's hard to fail at nachos, and I had the blandest nachos I've ever had, despite the beans, cheese, jalapeños, guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo piled on top. I'm not even sure which topping it was that tasted like cardboard because it ALL kinda tasted like variations of paper.   The space is small, and you order and then stand around blocking everybody else while you wait for your number to be called so then you can nudge your way back to the front.   I'm only adding a star because they seemed to have a decent beer variety on tap, although I didn't get any because there was no place to eat inside the premises.
