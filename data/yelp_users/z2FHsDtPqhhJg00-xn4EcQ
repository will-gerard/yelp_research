So I gues I will start out with what occupies by mind so with that being said ... on the yelp page for Ihop I noticed the red box which says Today is a national holiday.... wow I must not be in the know about this that and the other but I'm pretty sure Valentines Day is for sure not a national holiday but I could be wrong. Just had to mention this because its left me right and then left .... right and left... more left me thinking I need a serious update with the ever changing world we live in or have I been asleep at times when I really should have been awake.... hummmm so this location is centrally located in central Phoenix a lovely hotspot I call home... this particular location is conveintly located just north of Downtown Phoenix.... nice! Lots of parking and friendly staff always clean!!

I have been consigning for more than 2 decades and most recently here and my experience has not been the best. From items being dropped off never making it on my account to items being priced at pennies to the dollar is unacceptable.  I have to add how rude the manager is I don't know her name but I just tried to cash out the remainder of my account and was told they are closed and the door shut on my face. Well bitch I know this but maybe if I was able to cash out on the men's side I would not have to even have contact with your rude ass. I will be visiting the store tomorrow just to give her an ear full... very inconvenient and definitely not how you treat shoppers nor consigners.

I LOVE THIS PLACE !! They have anything and EVERYTHING you could possibly need for cooking baking and anything that has to do with preparation of foods. Its a little on the $$Pricey side of where your coins might be at the time but chances are well worth the money. They have spices, unique brands, imports, gadgets, scrubbers...... I could go on but I am sure I missed a few items, but once you go and check it out for yourself,  what I may have missed could be your new surprise !! PS THEY GIFT WRAP FOR FREE !! BONUS ! (and its the professional shrink wrap style too)

Cheapest auto parts in the valley for sure. Been buying parts here for about 7 years after switching from Autozone and wrecking yards... never have I run into any problems with anything I have purchased.... however I have returned a few items that I ended up not needing and its pretty fast service and no issues at all. Open until 7 and gets really crowded. Parking is the most complicated situation and chances are you will end up with marks on your car because of all the cars piled in the spaces and over crowded. The gamble with this is you should not worry if you have full coverage insurance because chances are the locals in a 10 mile radius don't. . . . . Jez sayn

This is either the best or one of the best savers in all of ARIZONA. They have a wide variety of different items... lots of vintage high end designer merchandise and after being told that savers PAYS for all of their donations by the pound... unlike other competitors like goodwill. Savers buys all merchandise so this location has items from other states and loctations hence items that are super good finds. I love this location its kinda in a rough area but it adds character.

One of the best if not the best mexican food in arizona. Authentic as it gets and clearly explains why its always busy. If your looking for quality service and good food, then be patient of you have to wait because its definitely worth it.

OK no one likes to have to come into the Motor Vehicles but this location by far is the best location if you need to come to a mvd office to handle your beezkneez !! Usually clean sometimes there are lots of kids running like their parents have decided to just leave them behind but that's really the only CON when your weighing out your options for choosing this location overall. Always busy but this location is quick so that tells you the employees know what they are doing... best to come early and the only other bad issue with this location is during the summer it tends to be super muggy and hot inside with the amount of people in the building so wear deodorant and at times I really wish I had traveled with mine to help everyone out eveyone in the building... just sayn .... PS good luck

This is the best TJMAXX in the whole state of AZ. I have been shopping at this location for 20+ years and I have been to just about every location. Helpful tip from experience if your any size like myself which is smaller, the selections go quick so its kinda a pain having to frequent so often but if you want what your  after you will be on top of it and get them while they are out on the shelf because they go fast. GREAT selection of watches, under garment and the professional styling tools are some amazing finds. LOVE THE fragrance selection too... I love this location... Yes the Paradise Valley is my #2 hotspot if Scottsdale does not have what I am looking for. STAFF members are always nice and friendly even when I go in after working and my eyes are suuuuper bloood shot red form working with chemicals .... thanks guys.

WAXING QUEEN HANDS DOWN ... If your looking for a new esthetician to do your waxing look no further. D'lisa is AMAZING !! Not only does she wax women but she offers services to MEN TOO ! Not very many offer such luxury for men. I have super sensitive, thick corse hair and home shaving was a never ending battle with ingrown hairs... Battle OVER  ... It hurt at first but I have no bumps no irritation  and my skin looks amazing. ( PS I got a manzilian in case you were wondering)   THANKS D'LISA xxoo Janmichael

I have been storing at this location and it has changed employees a few times but honestly this is one of the nicest facilities in the city of Phoenix. Every staff member has been on point and always ready to help. Going above and beyond to make sure I'm helped and no problems.  My girl is Cindy!! She needs to be the facility manager and the only reason she is not is maybe she is over qualified?? Dunno but she would seriously complete this property.  She delivers 100% customer service always goes above and beyond to make anything work. She is the person to talk to if your looking to rent a unit. THANK YOU CINDY FOR ALWAYS HELPING ME I APPRECIATE YOU!! JANMICHAEL

Well can I say my first experience was a bad one because I hit a jackpot for 900 doll hairs .... Yes doll hairs no too bad for starting off with 5.00. . . . .pure luck im sure but however the food here was pretty decent but cant say too much about the locals, very nice nonetheless but definitely not the same as casino arizona in scottsdale... In conclusion its probably safe to say i most likely will be back.

WINCO IS THE NEW COSTCO!! Cheap prices no matter how cold it is!! This is your grocery store ... Always clean... Never crying babies or kids running all over the store without parents, super clean, always stocked with everything, great selection of spices, produce, every kind of cheese you could be looking for. The only thing missing is a section on rare imported foods like trader joes and ajs offer,if they add that ... They conquer all for sure!! Unicorns and glitter!!

This location is just , ..........OK. To add to the 24hr drive thru comment everyone is leaving , they sinply forgot to say its only open 24hr on Fri,Sat and Sundays. So its really not open 24hr a day ... Just the three days which im not sure why but all the other bertos are open 24hr 7days a week 365 year. Not the best when it comes to getting orders right either i think its because the drive thru person taking orders and working the window sinply does not pay attention probably because they are too busy with the young children as workers. Im sorry when you are at work please stop texting on your phone and work ,Its called your on the clock for a reason and its called a job .... Anyhow they just opened this location and its progressively getting better i might add... And yes i live in the area of melrose and glad to have a location super close.

Hit or miss , but definitely fun sometimes to come in and just kind of search I guess that this whole addiction is more looking for the find and sometimes you find it and sometimes you don't. You never know what you may find. Happy hunting !
