I read great things about this place and their vegan options so I was excited to give this place a try. But I wasn't impressed. The service wasn't that great (slow, uneven and he didn't even bother to open my beer for me). I arrived with 3 other people and we all received our food at different times. And about the food: I can't speak for the entire menu as I've only been there once but the vegan sandwich I ordered was just ok and the fries were terrible (frozen, cheap???). The owner did come over and speak with us and she was very nice and the entertainment was good but I was disappointed when I left as I read such good things about this place. May give them another try though....

Went to this place on a recommendation. To be honest, I always thought this was more of barber shop than a salon. Boy, was I wrong! It's def. a salon albeit nothing fancy but the staff is really nice, the prices are great and Dave, Sr does great hair. I hear Chuck does great hair as well. Very impressed with this place and look forward to my next appointment!

I wish I read the reviews of this place before coming here. Place is awful....was hoping to "spruce up" a pair of wedge sandals that really didn't cost that much but was hoping to get one more season out of them. The guy (owner???) (who, by the way,  is extremely unlikable...ugh) tries to way overcharge me and then when I balk, he finally came down in price. Then his repair guy did the exact opposite of what they said they would do to my shoes and ended up ruining them. Then they tried to "fix" what they did and after seeing that, can't understand how this place stays in business. What a joke!   Again, they weren't the most expensive shoes so don't care about that but this experience is a sign that they are a terrible business who will tell you ANYTHING just to get your business. And to top if off, they can't even repair shoes!

First time customer here. Stopped in and got a pedicure; no waiting. David did my nails and I ordered "The Works" which cost $32.00. Worth.Every.Penny. David did a fantastic job; it was sooo relaxing....would have been perfect if I didn't have to listen to a girl yapping on her cell phone for most of the time but other than that, I was very impressed. The only regret is that I didn't give him a bigger tip (I did tip 20% but he deserved more!!!) Very attentive service, very relaxing, affordable and a nice, clean salon. Highly recommend!!!!

I'm all about supporting your local farms but this place is a joke. Cashier has no clue what good customer service is and the owner makes no apologies for nickel-and-diming their customers. And their not smart enough to post a sign that they charge $1.00 for debit/credit cards so not only do you not get my $1, you do not get my business.  Also, read through the reviews...you will see other customers feel the same about their terrible customer service and the owner's reply is always rude. I'll gladly take my business elsewhere!

7/2/15 Update: Went last weekend and man, not only did they raise their drink prices, but to the point of serious price-gouging! And to add insult to injury, the drinks they did make hardly had any booze in them. I understand you need to raise prices from time to time but this is b.s. I'll never go back....  Original Review: Great spot to see killer, live comedy. I"ve been about 4x and it's always a blast! Great location (downtown Scottsdale), cheap tickets, funny MC's and always the best comedians. Full bar service tops off a great night of comedy....highly recommend!!!!

My boss and I decided to stop in for lunch and give this place a try....I wish we kept on going down the road....we waiting about 5 minutes before we were finally seated. Our waiter was good at first, brought us hot, fresh bread that was pretty good but when he brought our appetizers of grilled mixed veggies, my boss practically choked on a staple! How the hell does a staple end up in an appetizer??? When we showed him, he argued with us that it wasn't a staple but part of the metal scrub brush his dishwasher uses....like that makes it better!! The little Italian lady at the front acted like she could care less, the waiter continued to argue with us on what the piece of metal REALLY was...I really think these people either have sh*t for brains or just don't care....either way, EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!

Met a group of people here for Happy Hour and it was so worth it! Servers are friendly and efficient, food is excellent (try the pumpkin soup!!!!) and their HH prices can't be beat!  Even thought the place was 3/4's filled (it was Halloween night), the place isn't noisy at all and you can carry on a conversation. Highly recommend!

I've  been to several of their locations throughout the Valley and hands down, one of the best pies around! I haven't tried their other food but why would I when this place is known for their pizza? Pizza's are on the smaller side but their pizza menu is fantastic...highly recommend the mushroom & pancetta pizza! Service is spotty depending on which location and time of day you go but overall very good dining experience!

I used to go to them for eyebrow waxes and their techs really do a great job but am seriously tired of trying to be upsold every time I go there. I just want my eyebrows waxed from time to time; do not feel the need to pay them hundreds of dollars up front  just to prepay for a years' worth of waxes. I've decided to take my business elsewhere.

Ann is great! She gives very personalized skin care advice, her peels are the best and very affordable too! While there, you can get a quick eyebrow wax while the service is being performed. She offers a hosts of services: facials, peels, dermaplaning, Botox, massages. She is your one-stop shop for great skin! She also carries SkinScript, a great line of skin care products that is manufactured in Tempe. Her salon is very relaxing and nicely decorated/furnished.I highly recommend Ann and her staff for a bit of pampering we all need and deserve.

Food is good; however, they skimp so much on ingredients, you feel like you're getting totally ripped off. The nickel and dime you for everything....not worth the price and won't be back.

Pizza is out of this world! Ordered it several times for the office and it has quickly become everyone's favorite! Only done take out so can't comment on the actual place but can say dealing with their employee's is easy, quick and they always get the order right. Highly recommend!

Been going to this place for pedicures, manicures and fills and they always do a great job....I used to live down the street from the salon but have since moved further away. Tried other places but they don't compete with this place so I'll drive out of my way to come here.   Your best bet is to make an appointment as the salon gets busy.

Tons of other medspa's to go so no need to waste your time and money here. Bought a Groupon and used the dollar amount towards Photofacials for broken capillaries. Well, they don't even bother to tell you that Photofacials won't work on red area's (only brown) so wasted my time and money going there.

Stay away from these "movers". They could care less about your stuff! 1/2 my stuff has some form of damage that I didn't catch until after they left. Cheap, yes. On time, yes. But worth the damage to my stuff? NO!!! Run, don't walk away from this joke of a company!

Michele is the best...she takes the time to listen to your skin concerns and her prices are fair. There is a reason why she has a ton of 5-star reviews! She offers a host of skin care treatments/products. If you have any skin care concerns, Michele has a solution for it. Highly recommend!!!!

Mom and I stopped in for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and the place was packed (which is a good sign!). We only waited a few minutes before being seated at the counter (which we were glad as the dining room was packed and noisy). The food was great (had the cheese omelet with mushrooms-excellent!) However the exception was the home fries, which came in a large block, were greasy and tasted like they were previously frozen. Other than that, the service was great, coffee was good and they kept the refills coming. I'll def be back but will choose the homestyle potatoes instead.

Incompetent service? Check! Overworked employees while other employees stand around? Check! Giving you a screwed up order? Check! If you love having your time wasted, then by all means frequent this location as much as possible! If you want good, competent service and accurate orders, visit the many other JJ's in the area.  After attempting to send a complaint through JJ's main website, I received an error message (more time wasted!) and my complaint couldn't go through. How convenient for an error message to pop up when filing a complaint!  JJ's food is OK....I consider them ok sandwiches for when your too lazy/busy to drive out and grab lunch (even though they seriously skimp on ingredients!)...I can seriously live without it and will do just that. My office usually orders delivery from them about 3-4 times a month but I told them if they want JJ's in the future, to go order it themselves as I'm done with them. Too many other sandwich places out there to waste my time with JJ's.

Found this place as a vendor at the Willo District Home Tour (actually I saw a sign that said DESSERTS and made a beeline for it!) and I was glad I did! Bought and tried their salted caramel cookies, the Kitchen Sink cookies (which have potato chips in them) and their apple pie. I'm pretty sure I gained a few pounds but it was SO. WORTH. IT. Everything was soooo good and I'll def. hit their store to try their other items!!!

Disgusting, gross, unedible.....I've never been so disgusted by food in my life. Ordered a simple tuna roll, the roll had a really fishy smell and the avocado was hard. One bite, threw the rest away, wasted my money but at least I didn't get sick!   The staff was very nice and friendly but I'm not going there for that!
