Great airport.  I will do my connection through this airport if I have a cost effective option to do so, and i don't mind doing longer layovers here.   Clean airport, attendants in bathrooms, good selection of food establishments, decent prices, sufficient places to sit, with seating also near outlets to charge your devices.

Young lady that served me was busy chatting (about nothing related to work) with another male coworker, so i had to wait to order til she was done chatting. She kept talking to him as she took my order, barely acknowledging i was standing there. I asked her for honey mustard, she didnt even hear me. She handed my receipt and card back without even looking at me or saying thank you,  still talking to the coworker.  I still wanted honey mustard, so finally I said Excuse me, to which she replied, Huh? I repeated myself and she says they will help you with sauces down there when you pick up your order.  I went to the other end, they threw my chicken fingers in a bag and folded it, never asking me if i wanted any sauce at all. And no thanks or nothing.   I was hoping the chicken fingers would at least be good, but no such luck - they were dry/hard and not good at all. Buyers remorse set in, but it was now 10pm and everything else in the airport was closed.   Not going back to this place.

Loved this place!!!    My husband and I were in the area attending my family reunion, and this restaurant was recommended by a staff member at the Hyatt Place.   It was a short walk from our hotel.  We went around 1 pm for lunch on a Monday. There was no wait at all for inside seating and 1/2 hour for outdoor seating (we were in a rush so we sat inside).  It was a nice atmosphere both indoor and outdoor, and their bathrooms were also very clean and cool looking.  Our waiter was friendly and gave us good recommendations.  We started with the bread with pesto. This was the best pesto I've ever tasted.  I think maybe it had more cheese than most I've tried.    I ordered the butternut squash and spinach cannollini (sp).  It was absolutely delicious! I LOVED the different flavors I tasted with each bite, a sweet and salty taste - almond slivers, spinach, mushrooms, squash, butter sauce, etc.   My husband is a basic kind of guy when it comes to food, so he ordered the burger on toasted wheat bread (he does not like ciabatta and all of the other fluffy 'foo foo' type of bread).  He said the burger tasted fresh and it had arugula on it, not your standard burger.  The fries were also good.  My husband had a peach bellini which was delicious, and I had a red sangria which was also great.  When we were done, I decided to walk through the area with the gelato.  I ended up with 1 scoop of Oreo cookie and cheesecake gelato and another of blueberry cheesecake gelato.  Both were creamy and delicious.  This was our last dining experience before leaving AZ.  We had a great time in AZ and this was the icing on the cake.  I am SOOO glad we decided to come here!

I am a Hyatt Gold Passport member and I have frequently stayed at Hyatt Place when I travel.  Under the recommendation of me and my cousin, our family decided to stay at this hotel for our family reunion (approx 25-30 people).   Things I liked about this hotel: -Convenience to Old Town area and cart drivers -Hotel grounds were nice/clean and safe -Comfortable beds -Hotel staff was generally friendly and very accommodating to our group (special kudos to Erik, Evi and Rick) -Seating in the hotel was adequate and comfortable -Nice Pool area - sizable shaded area, comfortable lounge chairs, towels provided near pool, periodic misting -Above average breakfast included with stay- decent options, hot and cold, good taste (except the fruit) -Free wireless  Things that could be improved: -Check in was painful.  For some reason they could not find my name quickly, and they never did get my parent's reservation correct after several calls prior to arrival and even after checking in.  It took them a long time and several people to get them checked in, and my mom's last name was still incorrect when she received the checkout bill. -Husband's key kept getting disabled throughout the stay (he was not putting it next to his phone or anything). He had to get a new key each day.  -Elevators were extremely slow -Small bathroom -Gym was small/lacking equipment (1 bike, 2 treadmills and an elliptical).  No weights/weight machine or anything else. But they did have a water cooler and towels there. -Drinks were expensive ($7 or $7.50 for a 1-shot drink) -Would have been nice if there were more condiments put out so we can take them to the table - had to keep getting up to add ketchup, salt, pepper, etc  -Would have liked to have flavored coffee creamers, only half and half was available  My biggest issue was the rate and some random issues while booking the rooms and changing over the credit cards. For a group with 25-30 people, I was not pleased at all with the various/higher room rate(s) we received. We went through the sales group as directed and booked together, but everyone had different rates ranging from something like $103 to $193 per night, plus taxes which are somewhere in the range of $25-40 per night extra). One family member who booked at the last minute ended up having a lower rate than others who booked as part of the group. This seemed somewhat shady. I didn't want this to mess up my weekend with the family, so I decided to speak with the Assistant Manager about it upon checkout.  Basically she she was unapologetic, stating she cannot go back and change the rate, she said that everyone had different rates and that we should have gone through sales to book (umm, we did!).

I received a box of about 6-8 brownies (variety pack) from a friend / business associate about a year ago - and I haven't stopped thinking about them since!  Did they put crack in these things?  I LOVE LOVE LOVE these brownies!    These brownies are as good as it gets.  Nice and moist on the inside.. slightly crispy on the outside...perfectly sugary sweet and fudgy...and rich...OMG I'm drooling just thinking about them!  They are just sooo sooooo good!    I'm reading the other reviews saying the brownies were dry...What???  Were they eating the same thing I was eating?  Maybe they left them sitting around too long?  But I had my box of brownies around for a while and they were fine, they never got hard.  I even put them in the freezer eventually so they wouldn't go bad...and even when I took them out and warmed them up a bit in the microwave, they were still delicious.  I see they have Sprites (individually wrapped half portions of a brownie) - this is even better!  Since they are so rich (and so many calories), I don't eat the whole thing in one sitting.  Not that I couldn't because I CAN and I WILL, but it makes it easier for portion control being packaged in half portion sizes.  I still have a bag of chocolate coffee that came with the brownies.  I will have to try that very soon, I bet that's delicious too.  A word of advice...don't look at the nutritional info.  Just don't.  Have a big glass of milk nearby.  Since they are so rich, they go great with milk.  My husband will be ordering me some soon - I made him a bet on something that I knew the answer and I bet these brownies.  Whoo hoo, I can't wait!!!

Maybe I'm missing something, but I found nothing good about dried up chicken fingers and a overcookrd biscuit that tasted like old grease.    I will definitely stick to popeyes for my chicken.

I was with a group of family members and we initially planned to go to Montagu's, but they were serving only appetizers on Sunday at the time we went (2 pm).  So I found this place nearby on Yelp and we walked there.  We were provided the Sunday brunch menu which had a choice of breakfast or lunch options.  When we first looked at the menu we thought we had made a mistake coming here.  But once we got our food, everything we ended up ordering was absolutely delicious!  Things we ordered:  -Eggs, bacon and toast (my dad is a basic kind of guy)  -Kobe Burger bacon + brie + apple-jicama-watercress slaw + smashed fingerlings + crisp fired sage + smoky blue cheese (My husband ordered this on toasted wheat bread since he doesn't like ciabatta or other fluffy breads. He didn't care for the fingerling potatoes served with it because he prefers regular fries. But the burger was nice and fresh)  -Grapefruit and sugar charred salmon: snap peas + fennel + blackberries + pistachio + orange + charred onion + black quinoa + snow pea shoots  -Lentil cauliflower bowl: organic cauliflower + rainbow quinoa + organic black lentils + pickled red grapes + crispy brussels sprouts + honeycup dijon + aioli   (I know this doesn't sound great, but it was -  I added the grapefruit and sugar charred salmon with it, delicious!)  -Sangria - it was mixed with a drier red wine, with just enough sweetness (my mom and I liked it)  We were only in town for a limited time and I'm glad we decided to come here.  I didn't end up eating another meal for the rest of the day.

We had a family reunion in Scottsdale AZ, and one of our events was going to the Grand Canyon.  We took the 2 1/2 to 3 hour drive from Scottsdale to the Grand Canyon Railway station. There was plenty of parking available at the station.  We were in the Pullman car. The train was clean and it was a comfortable ride.  I loved seeing the country as we took the ride there and back.  The train staff was very friendly and helpful, answered our questions, and we enjoyed the narrative and events aboard the train (live music, jokes, train robbery). They announced our family reunion over the intercom which was nice of them.  The staff was also attentive to the kids, giving them crayons for coloring and also allowed them to come up to the mic and sing or tell a joke or two. We made sure to tip the staff.  My only complaint would be the shops at the train station.  Everything was super expensive (a pair of sunglasses for $24, a warm shirt for $50) and the staff was not very pleasant or helpful.  Overall our family had a great and memorable trip.

Was in Scottsdale for a family reunion, and a group of us decided to do the party bike.  We had a really nice time.    Our driver was awesome and friendly and very easygoing.  He had a nice selection of music on his tablet, however I would have liked if there was a wider variety of options.  We were allowed to have alcohol on board the bike and he had a cooler for us to keep drinks in.   We rode around Old Town for a while, singing along with the music and pedaling and waving at everyone as they watched and smiled.   Our first stop was at a bar. The only problem is that we were not allowed to purchase and take any open drinks outside of the establishment, only closed beer could be purchased and taken back to the bike.  I am not a beer drinker, so that left me no options. I wished we had pre-purchased a bottle or two of wine or sangria to bring.  We did not have to pedal, but I did to get exercise.  The bike seats are a tad uncomfortable if you aren't a routine biker.  As for the seat belt, it only strapped across my legs (not my waist)...false sense of security lol.  I was a little worried about my mom falling off because she was not holding on to the grips. I am glad we did not bring my younger cousin, she is very bouncy/animated and there's a good chance she would have fallen off.  The party bike driver stopped us off at a restaurant where we had lunch.  I forgot the name of the restaurant but it was a nice atmosphere.  We sat at the bar, the bartenders were very pleasant and attentive and the food was good.  My butt was kind of sore the next day, but overall the party bike was a great experience - something different and fun, exercise and sightseeing all in one.
