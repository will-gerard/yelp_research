I had a wonderful sunset birthday dinner. They served only the best farm-fresh-to-table ingredients. Everything was very seasonal (heirloom tomatoes, melon, beets). I had sashimi grade nairagi with mango kimchi. It was excellent, all of my favorite flavors in one dish! The lemongrass lychee semifreddo was fantastic as well. Excellent atmosphere, service, and food. I will be back.

The food was good but the terrible way I was treated far overshadows this. I purchased a Groupon for New India Bazaar. I paid $12 for a $24 Groupon as advertised in the headline but it comes as 2 Groupons at $6 for $12.  Unfortunately, it expired and I went to the business to redeem my Groupons at the original amount paid today. I had a horrible experience. At first I was told by the waitress it was expired and no good. I explained Groupon's policy and she claimed to not know what I was talking about. I asked to speak to the manager and I was told to go find him on the other side of the store where he was sitting with his feet propped up (he would not come to me). He said he did not think I could use them for the original price and he did not think his account was active. When I objected, he finally checked and reluctantly and let me use only one of them for the original $6. I was treated very poorly and everyone was quite rude. I have absolutely no desire to go back to the business to make another purchase in order to redeem the other $6 I have already paid!  I was not even asking to get the discount, just to get the money back I already spent!  Needless to say, I am not going back.

I took a trip to Long Beach recently and tried Cambodian food for the first time in Cambodia town. I came back home to Phoenix and had to get some more! Reathrey Sekong satisfies the longing!  I always get the katheaw noodle soup and one of their amazing boba drinks.  I'm so glad I found this place!

Very fun place!  Vegan ice cream is such a novel idea, and they do it well.  I had the chai tiramisu tSoynami and my sister had the almond oy vey.  It was my birthday, so she let me swap with her because I liked hers a lot better!

Very tasty!  If you are in the mood for comfort food, this is the place. I enjoyed brunch there a few weeks ago with my mom. We both something sweet with a side of savory meat. I had the Johnnycakes which is like a corn pancake with prickly pear syrup. Mom had the boxty which is apple and potato pancake with mascarpone.  We were full for the entire rest of the day I believe.  So satisfying!  There weren't too many healthy things on the menu, but I don't think that's what we were looking for.  Excellent cappuccino too!

I cannot believe I've been living in Phoenix a year and just now discovered this place!  I have been looking all over for a place like this!  This past weekend I hiked Camelback thanks to the energy I acquired from the wonderful acai bowl and cappuccino I enjoyed at Chop Shop!  This is healthy living at its best and most delicious!  I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu, it all looks fabulous.
