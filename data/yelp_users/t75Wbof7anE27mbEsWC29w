I usually use uber but because no drivers were available and my boyfriend and I were in a hurry we got in one of the aaa cabs. We had flown all day and were exhausted . The driver chose to sit in all lanes that would be the slowest and drive 5 mph under the speed limit, I swear to get money out of a very short trip since my boyfriend lived less than ten mins from the airport. As soon as we got home the driver rushed us out of the car without giving me a chance to grab my things which of course I left my phone in the car. I called the dispatcher who had to transfer me to a man who deals with the drivers. This man got very rude rude with me and hung up twice. I did get my phone and belongings back but I will never use a cab again from these money hungry scammers. Uber will always be worth the wait!

My boyfriend and I visit this location at least once a week. We love how close it is to home and it's nice environment to just relax and have late night drinks. I would love to give this review 5 stars because many times the service is just that, but unfortunately the female staff are a bunch of snobby brats. They are extremely rude and have a very careless attitude. My boyfriend came in with friends yesterday and said his server was great but the second I showed up with my son she changed her attitude and was really rude the rest of the time. I just wish the females took some guidance from their male staff. It's sad that it even has to come down to male or female. But we do love The Vig!!!

I have never had a bad experience at this location. Every person I work with whether it be in person or on the phone is extremely helpful and kind. Every aspect of your time spent there is great and each staff member makes spending time there easy. Thanks discount I appreciate the service!

I am usually a huge fan of Wildflower, but not of this location. The coffee was old and the food was cold. When I asked to get cooked potatoes they were very sweet but still gave me cold food. Disappointed!

I have been to this location a few times and haven't been super impressed, but my most recent visit was by far the worst. There was a wait which I didn't mind seeing as it was a Saturday night in Scottsdale. After we out our names on the list my boyfriend went to the bar to get drinks. The bartender didn't say more than 2 words to my boyfriend and just stared at him as if he was wasting his time. My boyfriend asked the guy what they had on tap and the rude reply given was "beer" as the bartender walked away. After throwing a menu at my boyfriend he stood there not saying a word. We ordered drinks and my boyfriend asked how much he owed and the rude bartender said "'more than 5 less than ten, but I'll print you a receipt since you can't seem to figure it out". We paid and walked away. It was by far the rudest behavior I have ever had from a bartender.  Our server was ok, but the wait was not worth the first impression of the night and the mediocre food.

Delicious!! Quick and easy! I got the big toasty and added avocado and it was a great way to start the morning. Staff was a little awkward, would have liked a little more help with menu seeing as it was out first time there. But still will be back!

Would have loved to try the coffee and see if it was worth the drive after reading all the great reviews, but the second we walk in this man behind the counter screamed at my sister for parking her car poorly and that she needed to move it. Wouldn't want to waste my money on someone who thinks its ok to speak to his customers that way.

The food was actually decent but the not worth the experience of waiting for over 30 mins. I understand that they were having their lunch time rush but the employees were not working smart or time efficient. I think their management should be over the age of 18. Never going back again
