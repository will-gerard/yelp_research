This is a fantastic little discovery. Incredible array of sandwiches and dishes, not the same old sandwhich shop... and the owner is a wonderful guy worth supporting. Highly recommended!

I am so glad I found Dr. Mansell's practice.  Having recently moved to Scottsdale, I was looking for a dentist I could actually trust to do the 'right thing'.  There's a lot of promotions and bait and switch offers out there from other dentists.  Dr. Mansell's practice is focused on patient care and integrity.  After reading several reviews that were raving about her, I gave it a try.  I've found a great practice from someone who is really truly passionate about patient care first.

I was pretty stoked to try this out, everyone recommended them as authentic good Thai food.  The Laab Chicken I ordered was anything but authentic, and not tasty.  I may give them another chance, but it seems that they (maybe shrewdly) accommodate to the American tongue: and if you know your Thai food truly, you probably will not be psyched.  If you are looking for a first entry into Thai food, possibly an OK place.

I have enjoyed Tottie's excellent Asian fusion for many years. She has now just opened up this new location focused on take out and delivery for the North Scottsdale area. Same excellent food as the other places. Can't recommend the Pad Se Ew enough- enjoy!

Looking for your standard Pho and Vietnamese fair?  This place does it just right.  I spoke with the owner and length and he was very proud of the freshness of ingredients they use, and that everything is done on sight, they are not using premade ingredients.  The effort shows in the food that is served- excellent!

Takeda Thai is very good at interior decorating, but not actually preparing well made Thai food. If you really know authentic Thai food you will not be happy here. Those that don't know better may be OK with the food here.   The Thai Beef Salad was very disappointing.  Very salty, overly seasoned, and not tasty.  The beef itself was hard and chewy. This can be such a wonderful dish when prepared correctly.   The Tom Yum chicken soup I ordered 2/4 stars on the spice level, was incredibly spicy- focusing on hot spice rather than balanced flavor.    We walked out with a $35 bill and still very hungry, as we barely ate 1/4 of our feed before just giving up and leaving.  Truly an expensive and greatly disappointing dining experience.

Thank God (or the Buddha!)  this place exists-  prices are great, as is the selection.  You want authentic asian ingredients, this is the place.  Lots of good restaurants in adjacent mall as well.

I worked with Josh Hill, and I feel fortunate that he was recommended to me by a coworker.  As a Yankee transplant new to the area, Josh was incredibly patient and helpful in allowing us to first learn the area, show us tons of options, and provide a fair and balanced view on our choices. His follow up was perfect, and he went way beyond the call of duty.  He is also incredibly knowledgeable about the area and the real estate market.   Highly recommended!

Lincoln Air came out originally to help with a NEST thermostat install after another installer said it could not be done- they got it working no problem. A year later when it was time to replace my entire HVAC system they responded to my RFP and against several other companies won my business with the best price offer. Their service during and after the install has been simply excellent. They continue to provide seasonal maintenance checks per the contract and proactively reach out to schedule these and remind me. Curtis, the technician who has worked with us, is really good, and a man of his word. Highly recommended.

Jeff Lawson showed up right on time and got the job done quickly and the right way.  He was very cordial, and fair with his pricing.  I would recommend him to anyone.
