I do not have enough great things to say about this practice! I have been a patient for years and Dr. Deka just delivered my first son a few weeks ago! Each and every office visit the front office staff greeted me by name and asked how I was doing, all of my questions were answered by Dr. Deka at each visit and she prepared my husband and I for delivery ! She has AMAZING bed side manner and is so encouraging about everything. During the delivery she was so positive and explained exactly what was going on.  I felt 110 percent comfortable with her and I so appreciated her helping to make my first pregnancy so awesome! I definitely recommend this practice and Dr. Deka! She is amazing and AWESOME at her job!

I LOVE steak and Ruth's chris WAS my favorite place to eat until......my boyfriend called in early January to make reservations for Valentine's day. I was super excited in the month leading up to Valentine's day so he called to confirm our reservation a few days before. When he called, he was told they didn't have a record of his reservation. Since Ruth's Chris is an upscale restaurant he assumed he wouldn't need to get the girl's name he made the reservation with and when he spoke with the manager he basically told him he was out of luck because he had didn't have the name of the girl he made the reservation with. I have been to Ruth's Chris many times in the past, but after this experience, I will not be going back. I understand mistakes being made, but you'd think with this type of a restaurant they would have  a more efficient way to track reservations. We ended up having a great Valentine's day and he was able to get a reservation at a much better steak place (cooler atmosphere, better food and he received an email confirmation of our reservation with a reservation number!)

I have been to both other Grimaldi's locations in Scottsdale and I have no complaints. We decided to make reservations for mother's day because my mom loves Grimaldi's. The "waiting area" is more like a closet space. We had reservations and still waited fifteen minutes to be seated although there were at least 20 visible open tables. . We ordered a salad to start which was decent...but very small, and then we ordered a pretty standard half pepperoni and half cheese pizza and waited, waited some more, and waited even longer. Forty five minutes later (after everyone around us had been served) my dad grabbed a manager. He said he'd check on it and within three minutes our "pizza" was brought to us. The crust was stiffer than cardboard and I could have cooked a better tasting frozen pizza in my oven. We grabbed the manager and explained to him that the pizza was definitely not up to Grimaldi's standards.....he told us the oven was broken and that it normally runs at about 1200 degrees but tonight it was running at 500. My family and I are pretty laid back and understanding and we get that things are going to break or not work properly and the manager did comp us our pizza which was cool.  This location was confusing, seemed to be run by eighteen year olds, took FOREVER and this was definitely not a typical Grimaldi's experience. I understand things do happen and things break but between the poor service, horrible pizza, length of time we waited and the lack of "hustle" to serve us our food......we will definitely be sticking to the Scottsdale Quarter and Old town locations. And to top off the evening, myself, my brother in law and my mom all got sick.

After a non-typical Grimaldi's experience, the manager tracked me down from my yelp review and sent us a gift card. My family and I returned to celebrate a birthday and we were all blown away. COMPLETE turn around from our first experience. Our waitress, Sara was attentive, quick, and friendly. Our food came out quickly, fresh and delicious! I appreciate the initiative that was taken by the manager to ensure a second visit back and we will FOR SURE be back to this location again! YUM!

Courtney took our engagement pictures and will also be photographing our wedding in February. From the moment we sat down with her, we felt at ease. She is totally honest, funny, confident and professional. She is so great about catching spontaneous moments, and is up for anything. The pictures from the shoot turned out better than i ever could have imagined and i CANNOT wait for her to shoot our wedding. She is  easy to work with, accommodating, and an amazing photographer. You will not be disappointed!

SO GOOD! my husband loves diners, drive in's and dives and when we saw this place reviewed and realized it's five minutes from where we live, we decided to go there today for lunch. I'm not a super adventurous eater, but this was AMAZING! Awesome service.......our servers were attentive, helpful and helped us order!  We will FOR SURE be back!

THE BEST PIZZA i've ever had in Arizona! Everything about this place is amazing! We were looking for a place to grab some food before we went out and it's BYOB during certain hours (which my husband and his buddy were ecstatic about)! The restaurant is super clean and has a nice set-up. THe staff were amazing and although we ordered a specialty pizza, one of the guys gave us a sample of the pepperoni which is also AWESOME! All of the guys answered our questions and were very friendly. The prices are great and they have some deals that are available throughout the day. We tried the sweet jalepeno fig pizza and nothing I've ever tasted has even come close! It was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy and the slices were HUGE! I loved the crust too! I definitely recommend this place and we will definitely be back! They deliver and I will never eat at a chain restaurant again! LOVE this place!

My husband and I just moved into a new house and NEEDED to do something about our backyard. We had contacted a few places, one was a no show after we set up three different meeting times and one place never bothered to call us back. We came home one day and found the Brother Gonzalez Landscaping card on our door. We decided to give them a call because they do a free estimate. They arrived earlier then they told us they would and spoke to us about our backyard. After we agreed on a design we set up another appointment to look at samples. They again showed up when they said they would and brought the samples. They are incredibly reasonable, polite, honest and hard working. They showed up on Monday morning and worked until Thursday afternoon and our backyard looks amazing! I could not be happier with the work and with their attention to detail. After reading some reviews on here, I realize that not all people in this industry are reliable. If you are looking for reliability, great work and reasonable prices I suggest you give them a call! I don't think you'll be disappointed! We live in Scottsdale, and they were more than happy to do the work for us although they are based in Chandler.

such a great place! cool atmosphere, GREAT food and GREAT service! I'm not a huge beer drinker.....so I was super happy that in addition to their plentiful craft beer list, they also had craft wine! My husband and I will definitely be back!

Husband and I went there last night......AWESOME EXPERIENCE! Food was amazing.....i got the hamburger and he go the chili cheese hot dog and a sausage. We also got the fries! Even though it was SUPER crowded, our food was out quick! I can't believe how clean the place was with the amount of people that were there. Every employee was busy and positive. We had a great experience with an employee. Her name was Stephanie. After we finished, my husband and I were just talking. SHe approached us and asked how our meal was, gave us some suggestions for next time and was just chatting with us. We were sitting over by the shake/cake counter and I told her how I was debating getting a piece of chocolate cake. She told us how she helped make it from scratch that morning and that we had to try it. Convincing me to eat any type of sweet is not hard, so needless to say I ordered a piece. IT WAS UN-REAL! super moist and the frosting was the best I've ever had! Between the service, the food and the employees....we had a great experience. We will for sure be back!
