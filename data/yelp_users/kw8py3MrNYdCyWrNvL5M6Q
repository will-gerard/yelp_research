This place is AMAZING! I was greeted when I came in the door.  I was allowed to pick my seat, inside or out.  I asked for a specific table- NO PROBLEM!!!! The waitress, Beth, was so nice and informative.   I ordered dessert first....Chocolate cake-yum!  For dinner, the Blue Cheese Burger and Mac-n-cheese.   As you can see from the pics, hot and juicy.  I almost got the steak but I'll save that for another time because I will be back, w/friends!

I came down looking for a vehicle that was listed online.  The photo they used was a "stock" photo of an amazing blue extra cab toyota truck.  When I got down here, it was a white regular cab tacoma that had been used as a work truck.  Very beat up.    When I asked about the picture,  Joel stated an advertising company posts stock photos (which they are not responsable for, lol) and there is a disclaimer stating the pictures may not be real.  They did mention on the phone the color was white, not blue but seriously,  these are two different trucks.    My only thought is if they are less than honest with their advertising to bring in customers, what other issues would there have been?  Looking at other Yelp reviews, looks like it saved me a great deal of $$ and only wasted my time.

We started out with the tour.  You can do it before or after lunch.  You have a choice of two lunch options.  A one course lunch for $25.00 or 3 course lunch for $35.00.  Wine, beer, or cocktails are optional.  They have a First tier somiere (sp?)for wine so they have a phenomenal wine list, if you are into that.  We got the 3 course meal.  Two sections have multiple choices to choose from.  Desert had one choice.  Everything was excellent and tasty.    Service was spot on and very classy.  Some people come here dressy, like going to church.  Others are quite casual.  Its all good.  Inside is air conditioned.  You can walk around sell paced after your lunch, if you wish.  Was definitely a must see attraction and well worth the $$.  Also, people have formal events here like weddings and such.  So awesome.

I went here for a Bachelorette pre-party.  We dressed up in tutus, fairy wings, and tiaras.  I'm a plus size girl who not only kept up to the easy to follow instructions, but the instructors made it fun, looked like they were having a blast, and how much I wish I didn't live so far away....I would come here daily.  I just loved it!!!  I hope I can find a class near me just like this. , It was so much fun, not like exercise....although the sweat pouring off me would bely that statement, lol.

If your a veteran, avoid this place.  The franchise owner doesn't give the Veteran's discount.  Every other Ace's I have been to does honor Veterans but not this one.  Guess he loves the freedom the US gives him to own his own business, but not the people who actually fight for it.

Quick efficient waiter but he was so fast he forgot our bread plates (not that we ever use them anyways) lol.  Just stopped by fast enough to drop off food and off he went.  It was ok.  We were starved and just wanted our food anyways. ;)  I just loved it.  Great food.  Awesome time.

We were seated as soon as we got here at 6:45 PM on a Friday night.  That was surprising to me considering how packed the parking lot was.  The atmosphere was AMAZING! !!!  The waitress was nice and efficient but not too overly friendly.  She wasn't one who stood by the table and chatted.  Being that this is the first time here, I'm not sure if that is a requirement of the establishment.  It didn't seem to be a "noisy" place.  She checked on us promptly so she gets high marks for service. :)  The food tasted good.  It came out promptly and was cooked correctly but was nothing to write home over.  It was a nice change of pace and overall,  we had a nice dinner but I couldn't help wishing we had went to Texas or Piggley's.  It just wasn't for me.

What an AWESOME florist!!!!!!! I called them up on an emergency situation. My daughter called me needing a boutonniere for her prom date. I called these ladies up and they gave me a price, made the boutonniere within half an hour, and for $9. The other florists I called........what a hassle. These ladies, by far, are the nicest florists in the area.  I didn't even know what it was I needed.  Just told them the colors in my daughters' prom date's clothes and the flowers in her corsage and they made a BEAUTIFUL boutonniere.  They didn't charge me extra for late notice.  They didn't make it an issue that I called past a deadline.  They know how to make a customer feel great.  They will be my first stop for any of my floral needs in the future.

I came in w/ a coupon for the works (oil change, fluids check/filled/tires rotated) for $39.99.  They weren't busy at all and they got me right in.  They didn't try to up - sell the coupon, which I was expecting.  They didn't charge extra for this oil or that oil.  They didn't charge extra because I had a larger engine than a smaller vehicle.   They didn't charge extra to take off "the plate" (whatever that is....but I hear that a lot w/my oil changes, lol!)  They were super nice.  I know NOTHING about cars and I dread oil changes because they always ask questions where I go....."there's my vehicle" and point......and I get "the look." I am happy to say that they were super cool and just asked for my keys.  I didn't even have to drive my car around to the bay.  Once everything was done, they explained everything they did. I was really impressed. This is how these coupons should work.  :)  I will definitely use this company again.

My order:2 Eggs breakfast with bacon and oatmeal.....  I ordered the Basted Eggs medium and they came out runny.  It's a good thing THAT doesn't bother me.  A cook who doesn't know the difference between "Easy", Medium", "Hard", is bad.....in my book.  Just saying.  My bacon came out burned.  Funny, I didn't even ask for it crispy.  It was OK.  My SO took the burned bacon and gave me his. . Everything else was excellent and super fast.  My S/O Order: All Star Breakfast special:  His came out perfect.  How do you mess up scrambled eggs, hash browns, and toast, lol?  The service was great.  Very nice and friendly staff.  Would go again.

We ordered a variety of things and price was, $8.95 a dish...wasn't bad.  Shrimp with lobster sauce.  My daughter said it was delicious/she loved it and I have to trust her.   (The smell, if you don't like seafood, will put you off eatting dinner-esp if you are just trying to get a pic for Yelp, lol.)  Chicken Fried rice.  I I ordered this with no vegetables. It came out with no vegetables. I loved it. The chicken was moist and the rice came out perfectly cooked. Can't ask for more than that.  Mongolian beef. This is relatively spicy. I love spicy and for me this was a little more spicy than I was prepared for. It was still good.  General Tao chicken. This was a little on the burned side. Even so it still tasted OK. I love the sauce that it came in. It was not breaded which was a nice surprise.  Cheese rangoons these were absolutely fantastic. They went so fast I forgot to get a picture of them. The orange sauce that came with them was really thick like gelatin. I'm not sure why and I'm not used to that.  Potstickers.... These came out on the burnt side, as the pic shows. They weren't that tasty. I wouldn't let it stop me from going ordering them a second time though. But if this was something that is normal,  I might reconsider.  White rice, it's rice and cooked correctly.   The bag was packed with all the necessary supplies.  The diner is clean and the staff is really great.  The order came out quickly. This was my first time here and I ordered takeout.  Will definitely come again.

Interesting concept here at Johnny Rockets.  Send out the fries and onions rings as an appetizer instead of as the side dish to your burger and then send the burgers out 30 minutes after that.  I'm not sure how it's possible to burn half an order of onion rings while the other half comes out raw but they managed it here (as the pic shows).  Then, the minute one clears the last fry off one's plate, the waiter appears to whisk the plate away. I was thinking....."hey, what if I wanted to like the grease and salt off of that plate?!?!?!" (Not really, lol)  If they were as quick to serve their burgers as they were to clear the plates, this place would be awesome.  The only redeeming quality to this visit was the waiter.  As it was, we won't come back.  We arrived hungry and just wanted a "quick" bite while shopping and a wide cushy seat to rest my weary.....wallet!   Not an hour long meal, then when the burgers did arrived, to be rushed out the door so we can't even enjoy the burger.  Seriously, they were trying to box up burgers while my kids were halfway done.  NOT COOL!!!!  Next time we are at this mall, I'll skip round two and go for a truly quick bite at the food court where no one rushes your kids to eat their food.  Back to school shopping isn't the funnest chore but Johnny Rockets made this mama bear even crankier by pulling that crap.  I want the burger and fries together.  I want the food cooked correctly.  And I don't want my food boxed up while I'm still eatting it.  Pretty simple requests, right?

Fourth trip here.  VERY impressed w/their knowledge.   They have been fixing my daughter attempt to home bleach her dark brown hair to platinum blonde.   I was so impressed w/how they handled that situation,  I got my hair done here, my boyfriend got his hair cut here, and now my daughter's hair is finally ready to be set back to brown.  While here, I watched them fix other hair color boo-boo's from other salons.  They know what they are doing and aren't looking to do something to damage your hair just to make the rent.....that means a lot to me.  The do keep the place on the cold side, so dress accordingly.  ;)  Prices are reasonable.     Adult cut $15, Cut/style $25, kids cut$10, Color $40& up, perms $40 and up and they do waxing.

First time here.  Went between the lunch rush and the dinner rush so it wasn't crowded. We ordered an appetizer... The chicken wings. The waitress told us it would be about 20 minutes for the wings, which we thought was unusual but ok.....we can wait. They actually came out in about 8 minutes, along with our lunch.  Didn't like that.  Would have liked to enjoy some conversation with the appetizers. THEN bring out the food instead of mixing that flavor with our lunch.  Made it feel rushed and as a business, they should maybe wait to put in the meal maybe 15 minutes after the appetizers have been ordered.....not at the same time.  Overall, the food was good.  The service was good and we had a really nice waitress. Will go again.

Second time here.  This time for my daughter's 16th birthday dinner....her choice.  She picked the appetizer, pizza, and dessert.  I have to say that our second trip to this establishment far surpassed our first.    Our waiter was awesome and checked on us often, making sure our meal was correct and drinks were filled.  He even acknowledged my daughter's birthday in an appropriate way,  which was nice.  The Bruchetta was so good.  Our pizza was their version of the meat lovers w/thin crust.  My daughter's choice and everyone but me loved it.  I'm a pan pizza lover so it wasn't an issue of food quality,  just food preferences. When they say "thin", they mean cracker thin, lol.....but hey, it's healthier, right?!? He-he-he. Let's just say that there were no left overs to take home - it was that good! And a free birthday Pa'zookie for the birthday girl to round out the night......A home run, in our book.

No card needed for sales!  That's so cool.  If they don't have an item you are looking for, let the cashier know and they will write it down on an order form and give it to the manager.  They explained the receipt to us to verify we got our sales items!  $60 worth of steaks do $20.  12 bottles of large gatoraides for 58 cents ea.  So awesome!    Staff was so helpful and friendly.  We were asked numerous times if we needed assistance finding things.  I am really impressed with this store and the way it's run, the variety of things here that I can't find elsewhere.   This just may become my "go-to" store because it has so many hard to find things all in one place.

This is the best place to get money orders.   That line is NEVER busy.   I chose this Walmart over the Super Center every time.   The staff is always friendly and helpful.   They always know where to find stuff and will walk you to where it is vs point you and say which aisle it is at.     I wish they had more options in the vegetable section.   Just try to find non-organic zucchini!!!   Overall,  this is an awesome  neighborhood market to pick up little items here and there.

This place is amazing!     Very friendly staff.   Very informative  on what was available. Allowed this picky eater to order according to taste and it came out correctly!!!!   I ordered the pasta.   It was delicious.   Noodles cooked just right and hot.   The sauce was so delicate and light tasting.   Not overpowering of one ingredient over another.   The pizza is New York style and paper thin.....just the way it's suppose to be. Very foldable.   I'm so jealous  that I didn't  order that!!! (Next time!!!)   Will definitely  come again.   Best $5.00 lunch special!!!

I found this place thru a tech at the hospital.   Once I tried the meats here, I can't bring myself to buy meats at a grocery store.  I buy groupon deals when they are available.  They are more than willing to substitute pork for chicken in the packages. :)  (You don't have to buy in packages, if you dont want to.) They have great tips for cooking meats and they are knowledgeable about foreign meats verses domestic meats.  This is important...if you've never eaten game meat, the first time you eat meat not fed by corn or hay, you're in for a shock, lol.  So that truly impressed me.  Weekends during lunch are busy.  You can get deli sandwhiches, hamburgers, tri-tip.  You get your choice of side and a drink for $6.00+ tax.  Sides include macaroni salad, potato salad, baked beans, french fries, or cole slaw.  If you don't like cheese, make sure you ask them to leave it off or like me, you will be trying to pick it off your sandwich, lol.  Condiments and fixings are on a side table so you can put as much on (like Dagwood) as you like.  So, grab a groupon, try it out some weekend during lunch.  Win-win. :)  If you love it like I do, you can go back for more.

First time at this location.  It's a great deal smaller than the Gilbert location but by the looks of it, a lot busier.  I have been taking my children to Coury Family Medicine in Gilbert  for over 2 and a half years.  It occurred to me as I read the reviews that I don't think I have ever met the illustrious Dr. Coury.  Just the PAs'. (Who have all been great.)   I have been pleased by all the facilities they have.  The front desk staff is always polite.  The ability to test on site for things.  They always check up on my kids, when sick and even mail out a letter, if needed to follow up. I can't sing high enough praises for the way Dr. Coury runs his practice.

Its a small place.  Dancing upstairs with a bar.  Good drink prices till 11PM.  I wish they had an industrial fan up there to move the air (tucked in the corner,out of the way, would be awrsome), Casualwear to lingerie-it's all good.  21-45ish seems to be the age range.  Skinny to heavyset mix well.  There wasn't a clique-ish feel to the place, very friendly, or maybe that's just my mindset.  I got there at 9:30 Sat night....no line but there was one at midnight, when I left.  The bars on either sides had lines at 9:30.  Are they more popular bars....don't know.  Will check out another time.  Was here for a bachelorette party.    Overall, the staff was friendly and well trained.  The lines to get drinks moved fast.  Security was evident.  I didn't see any fights or guests get out of hand.  I had a pleasant evening and would recommended the bar.  They do need take care of the roof top.  If it is the only location to really let loose for dancing and it's over 100 degrees outside, they need misters or a fan to cool off a roof that's been cooking under the hot AZ sun all day.

I liked the mac and cheese that I ordered.  I got it with chicken added.  It's a huge bowl and I could only eat a portion and took the rest home.   They left a water pitcher on the table to refill water, as needed which was soooo nice.  :D  The area is good for groups and there is a bar and outdoor patio area.  Nice for a variety of moods.  The prices are reasonable.  The wait staff is excellent and very thorough.    The menu is varied so there are things for every mood.  Overall, this was a very nice place to eat.

Look at my reviews.  It's hard for me to give 2 stars.  This place was HORRIBLE!!!!  This place is EXPENSIVE!!!!!! For a family of 4 playing 3 games with shoe rental, plan on spending $100.  Pizza and a pitcher of soda- add in another $30.  The only thing "Cosmic" about the experience is the prices.  The cosmic bowling (or maybe its just this business that sucks) in California is so different!  In CA, they have stickers on the pins and if the stickered pins are the head pins, one wins prizes. There are contests that win prizes. The pins are glow in the dark.  There is no country music playing.  The do dancing between "rounds".  It's DJ'd. At this place, it's boring.  Just lights off and spinning lights. . Nothing special about it.  As for the staff!!!  4 people assisting with "shoes" and 1 person ringing people up.  Shoe people can't ring up CUSTOMERS even if there are 4 of them lounging around, eating popcorn, doing absolutely NOTHING!  No waitress in sight so I went to the cafe to order food myself.  THEN, after having my first experience with a great employee in the cafe, she brought my food order to my table (it wasn't even her job.) My waitress appeared.  (WHAT?  I don't need anything "NOW!")  We did have fun bowling but it's bowling.  We could have went on $2 Tues for the same thing.  I thought Cosmic bowling would be more "interactive", more fun-like how they do it in California/more games/contests along with the "cosmic bowling." This is just bowling with the lights off.  Hopefully another bowling alley has true "Cosmic" bowling.

First time here.  Nice salon.  I came in for a hair cut, hair color, and highlights.  Normally, I go to Fantastic Sam's but all my favorite stylists left.  I tracked one down here to White Lotus....woo-hoo. ;) (hint: follow them on socia media and you can follow them if the change shop)   When you walk in, one sees just a reception area.  The work in progress is hidden behind the wall.  Trust me, few women want joe public to see them in an unflattering light. ;)   They do a variety of things here. Nails, pedicures, eyelashes, tanning, etc.    It can be pricey but it's relative.  My SO thinks $15 is too much for a haircut.  I wouldn't trust a place who charges $15 to touch my long hair.  Reminds me of the sign my old salon had outside their store in California, "We fix $8.00 haircuts!" You truly get what you pay for here.  Hair washed, cut, scalp massaged, styled, and dried.  Totally worth the price.  You want to forgo the pampering and walk out of the salon like you walked out of the shower, go to a salon that charges $15.00!  My stylist Andrea came here from Fantastic Sam's to grow into a better stylist.  I definitely like the cheaper prices at FS but the new stylists there could not get my hair the way Andrea did.  I look at it like this....I would rather pay more and follow the stylist I trust than to be less than happy with shop-hopping trying to find a stylist that can maintain my exacting standards with my long hair.  Most stylist try to cut "dead ends" off and my hair ends up 3 inches shorter....a huge no-no for those of us with long hair.  Andrea "listened." Andrea fixed my color and cut.  I made an Appt for my next hair fix and hopefully, my hair will return to butt length very soon.  I highly recommended Andrea.  She's a keeper!

I love this store.  I have yet to have any issues here.  They have great stock.  They employees are friendly.  The food has been good.  We joke that just take the art of items you buy and multiple it by $10 and you have your total you spend for the day, lol.  We go there for the bulk items mostly and the munchies venders, lol.  It's like meals on wheels or a picnic while we shop. :)  Good Deals, too.

I didn't eat here but my idea of "comfort" food is different.   I couldn't sit where I wanted "because we get really busy"  and was stuck by a utility door because I made the mistake of coming here alone and didn't want to sit at the bar.  They kept getting into the door, which wasn't pleasant.  I looked at the menu and not a burger in sight and some crazy prices. I kid you not.  $12 for mac-n-cheese, $35 for steak, and $20 for chicken and waffles.  The steak sounded awesome, though!  If I could have sat at a nice table, maybe the prices wouldn't be an issue but to charge them and not even being "comfortable" and made to feel like coming there as a single person gets me the crappy table.....well, I got up and left.  I can get a better table, gorganzola steak, and not made to feel that being a single diner is an imposition at another restaurant.

The $10 coupon is no longer valid.     It redirects to the website and wants you to sign up for their mailing list. :(.  I liked the Chicken soup.  I didn't care for the bread with the oil/spice mix.  Toss some butter at me, please.  My meal was ok.  I loved the chicken but picked out the tomato chucks from my sauce on the noodles.    I would have preferred a blended sauce, I think over the large chunks.  Overall, I will try here again.  It's not Olive Garden (my favorite) but the soup will bring me back to try another entree.. :)

This place is AMAZING!!!!!  I have had problems w/ my previous dental provider and they addressed all my concerns.  They walked me thru every step and at my first appt was able to begin the first step of a much needed treatment.   No need to make a followup for weeks down the line, like I was expecting.   They even know how to bill a Health Savings card correctly!!!!!  I was able to download forms ahead of time and get all my insurance info processed prior to my first appt. They billed it correctly!!!!!! They confirmed my appt via text....A must in this day and age.  I was able to easily add all my kids to their service easily enough.  One of the things I like is the "the buck stops here!"  The owner of the business addressed every concern.  No corporate runaround trying to get answers.  People here do not ignore your concerns and offer empty promises!   They don't ignore your calls.  I wish Precision Dental had been my choice 2 years ago and I wouldn't be dealing with the "other" provider who is still giving me a hard time when I try to pay my bill and won't bill my insurance correctly and won't bill my health savings card correctly.  I should have done my homework then!!!!  Precision Dental reviews speak for themselves.  My first appt confirmed it so I am bringing my kids and telling my family and friends.

I like this place.   Forms are online.   One can have it filled out previous to the visit.   Reminder texts for appts-very nice.   Nice tour prior to appt. In house exrays so no having to go elsewhere to get them taken or anything.  Very friendly staff.   Greeted patients by name and it had a "Welcome new patients"  sign with my name on it-very thoughtful and it made me feel like I wasn't just a number.

Good food.  Fast service.  They used to have coupons on their take-out menus but they stopped doing that. :(

I reviewed the wrong restaurant.   I can't give it a glowing review just yet.  I'll have to check this place out....eventually.

Nice little place tucked away in a shopping center.  A real hidden Oasis.  The patio is surrounded with greenery and masters which help hide the shopping center.  As for the coke.... $1.25 for a can of coke is a little pricey.  I was expecting unlimited refills on my soda, thinking it was a fountain soda.  Lesson learned.  Ice Chai tea had the perfect blend of ingredients. Definitely not completely homemade but delicious, nevertheless.   The feta, olive, tomato, & pepperoni night bruschetta was pretty good but a little on the dry side.  We asked for a little olive oil to drizzle over it to give it that little extra pop.  Outstanding.  Salami, pesto, tomato bruschetta was a little odd.  Large slices of meat and tomatoes, like one would put on a sandwich.   Still tasted yummy but everything slide all over the place.  Would get it again. ;)  Service was outstanding.   I liked that the waiter gave suggestions and variations to the menu.  Couldn't have had a better experience.   :)

They must use a call center to place orders.  I missed placing an order by their cut off time by 8 minutes.   Refused to take an order but I can drive down to the store and risk them not being able to fill order.  If I had time to drive store to store looking for what I needed, I wouldn't have bothered calling in the first place.  If a business is going to use a call center to take orders and the cut off is done, then we should be able to reach the business to be able to find out if they can fill an order.  If you don't have time to answer my call, you don't have time for my money!

Considering you are commenting on this six months later, you OBVIOUSLY do not remember the conversation.   I was looking to order a boutonniere to pick up.  I was not tooking for a large order for delivery during the weekend.  A single rose, some baby's breathe, heck, I wasn't even picky.  It's not ok to use the "excuse" of being a small family owned busy business on a holiday weekend. But the point still stands!  That is what the phone is for. These are the facts. I called your business.  I reached an order-taker....who refused to connect me to your actual store.  I was not able to find out if you could provide the service I needed by phone.  I was told to drive to your location and make an inquiry, that I might get lucky but no guarantees. Sounds more like a call center who takes an order, not family owned.  A family member can always reach family. Seriously!!!!  If you have an "ORDER CUT-OFF deadline" where you dont take any more orders, WHY waste peoples' time sending them to your store?  Because you don't want to lose out on $$$. It's ok because I did find another "small, family-owned florist" by phone who managed to take care of my needs beautifully on the same busy day and she was in the same boat as you....only she had no trouble taking 5 minutes to answer my call AND make the boutonniere.  They got 5 stars, you get 1.

Blue cheese burger was good, standard fare.  Fries were good.  I asked for the combo .  $10.  Pretty standard pricing.    I wished the tables were cleaner.  I had to do that myself.  Teenager employees were super nice and friendly.  Liked that!  Great place to stop on my way to the movies.    Would stop again.

Every time I have come here, it's been packed and this time I got here at opening.  It was no different.  Within 30 mins, the place was noisy with customers-midweek.  That says something about the food, the service, the prices, etc.  Started out with the boneless chicken wings as an appetizers.  There are a variety of sauces to choose from to suit everyone's tastes, from mild, tangy, to suicide hot.  The spinach dip was perfect.  Hot and cheesy.  The pizza burger is no longer on the menu and with a quick check with the kitchen, they made it for me....how cool is that!!!  I didn't even ask the waitress to ask...she volunteered.  SERIOUSLY!  It is THAT kind of customer service that keeps people coming back!  The burgers were huge and messy-get all over your face variety.  We ended up talking them home,lol.  Overall, a really nice lunch.  Service was great but I will say this, don't plan on coming here if your limited on your lunch hour.  If it's busy, your meal will come out as your leaving to head back to work.  That's OK. A quick stop at the gas station was the answer.

First time here.    I asked to be seated in an area without ceiling fans and they accommodated me.   I asked for water w/o lemons and they bring a water pitcher to the table....so AWESOME!  I got the biscuits and gravy meal.  I asked for the eggs: basted/medium.  They didn't come out that way, as the pic shows.  It's OK because I stole bread off my boyfriends' plate and gave him one of my HUGE biscuits/gravy,lol.  The meal was still delicious. We got a side of bacon.  The bacon is thick, long, and extra salty.  Think beef jerky.  My boyfriend loved it and I didn't.  I think next time, I will ask for the bacon not to be cooked well done.  My boyfriend got a ham and cheese omelet.  It was fabulous.  Coffee was great.  He also loved the biscuits and gravy off my order, lol.  Service was great.  'A little too "happy"  for so early in the morning,' said Mr. Grumpy Pants but that was before he had his first cup of coffee in the morning.  I thought the waiter's happiness level was appropriate (I don't need coffee to wake up) and he made sure to check in regularly.  I thought the staff went out of their way to make sure everyone was happily satisfied.  I watched them and they seemed to be quick to make sure turnover kept the wait reasonable.    This would have been 5 stars if my food had came out correctly.  Maybe next time!

I have been taking my children to Coury Family Medicine in Gilbert  for over 2 and a half years.  It occurred to me as I read the reviews that I don't think I have ever met the illustrious Dr. Coury.  Just the PAs'. (Who have all been great.)   I have been pleased by all the facilities they have.  The front desk staff is always polite.  The ability to test on site for things.  They always check up on my kids, when sick and even mail out a letter, if needed to follow up. I can't sing high enough praises for the way Dr. Coury runs his practice.

You have to come for happy hour!  The deviled eggs are smooth as silk.  Creamy. Melt in your mouth.  I didnt want to stop,lol.  There are 4 on a plate, easy enough to share....if you want. ;)  The honey rosemary fried chicken has 2 large nuggets and a buttermilk bisquit in a puddle of delicious honey sauce.  We were seated right away and our orders were taken swiftly.  Our waitress was very nice and checked on us often.  There is a loud bell that ends "Happy Hour."  All and all, I am very please with my experience  here and will come again.

I had a Carne Asada Taco and had them add cheese. They forgot that and I had to send it back. :(   It was a good taco.   My friend had the chicken enchilada with 2 different sauces.  I took a bite and I liked the green sauce better.  They were both delicious but it was just preference.   I had so many people coming to my table, it was confusing who my actual "waitress" was.  I just grabbed the nearest staff member when I needed something.  They have a nice happy hour but the drinks were on the weak side.  I would like that for my drinks, lol but my friend did not.  Again, that would be preferences.  ;)    The ambience is casual and friendly.  I liked the staff.  I would definitely go again.

UPDATE: I had the Carne Asada Taco again.  Very good.  The cheese y mas was absolutely yummy.  The chips were on the burned side and hard, mixed in with a fresh batch.  We asked the staff and the whole batch was that way.  :(  I feel at that point, they should have made a fresh batch and not mixed the bad batch in them.  I got a watermelon Margareta.   If you like Solbe Life water w/tequila, you would like this drink. ;)  very light tasting.  I will give them a third  try because some of this was very pleasant and yummy and I am hoping it was an off day.....plus the staff is really awesome.

Great food.  Nice and hot.  I'm a very picky eatter and they followed directions to a "T."  Called in order and was ready in 10 minutes.  I can't even say that I want to find another fast food Chinese food location to eat at.  Not to mention, there are other fast food locations nearby for my kids who don't like Chinese food, lol.  Very convenient!

The chicken and fries are OK but my kids go for the bread and the dipping sauce, lol.  I don't care for it at all.  The chicken is on the bland side and needs the sauce to make it yummy.    The staff is always nice.  The restaurant is casual.

Great company.  So fast.  Reasonable prices.  Awesome customer service.  3% fee for credit or debit cards so bring cash.    They said it would be an hour wait and they were done in about 35 minutes.  There is a gas station nearby for drinks/snacks but they do offer free water to drink.    AC'ed  building.  Don't let the outside worry you.  This is a great, honest company.

Wait staff was good but young-underage so could not answer questions about drink specials and didn't offer to find out.  They should at least understand the menu. No biggie there really since menu lists main ingredients in drinks....just sit at the bar if your going for happy hour.  TVs are playing sports but they don't interfere with the rest of the atmosphere.   Music playing softly in the background but doesn't drown out conversation.   Food was awesome all around and reasonably priced.  I didn't care for my drink, though.....very bitter.    Will definitely go again!

Ok, I came here a few days ago to get my nails done.  Gel Polish.  One peeled right off.  I came to see if they could fix it an hour before closing.  They refused to polish 1 nail.  I didn't even ask for it to be free or anything... .just could they paint the nail so I didnt look all homespun for 4th of July.  First, if the product you sell FAILS, you should do all you can to fix it TODAY.  I see salons so willing to take a cpl minutes to fix their stuff.  2nd, if you cant stay 5 minutes past closing to fix a bad polish, your in the wrong business.  Word of mouth is everything and I will tell everyone of my experience and avoid a business that sells faulty work.

I have been here numerous times.  Sometimes with my daughter and sometimes, I bring friends for a girl's day out treat.  I have had no problem using coupons.  I just follow the guidelines.  (No buisness can be expected to run in the red, after all) I have received gift certificates for bringing so many different people to this establishment and have had no issue using those either. They have a reward card for when you purchase so many services, you get one free.  Waxing services have been great and super fast without any problems.  $15.00 for lips and eyebrows so very reasonable, price-wise.  For pedicures, they offer various packages for the budget conscience to the extremely pampered package.  For manicures, they have a variety to meet different tastes.  They do French, can paint designs, glitter, etc.  They are quick to meet the customer with their design ideas and offer substitution ideas.  They also do eyelash extensions but I have not used them for that.

You know it's a bad place when the cashier says he's not going to be working there much longer.  My friend ordered the teriyaki bowl.  They forgot the broccoli.  When she asked about it, she said they don't put it on.  When she complained, they pulled broccoli out and threw it on the grill for 30 seconds and tossed it on top.  It was cold/charred at the same time....NICE!!!!! I got broth and asked for nothing in it.  It came full of soggy veggies.  I had to pick them out.  The man handled the noodles with his bare hands and had a band-aid on....health code violation!!!!  They don't clean the grill between grilling chicken and shrimp.  God forbid your allergic to seafood.  Maybe people like their shrimp tasting like chicken.   MY daughter went next door to Far East Asian Fire ran by the same company.  Let's just say we got our money back at both places.  And let me say this.....the food has to be really, really bad for me to give 1 star and for me to ask for my money back.

Love the food.  My son devoured his burger so fast I'm not sure he even tasted it, lol.   Next time, I will get the dressing on the side.  Way too much was poured on my salad leaving the bottom looking like a bowl of soup but that was my fault.  I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side.  Will definitely come again.      Don't let the name fool you.  They have salads, shakes/malts, chicken sandwiches,  grilled cheese, hot dogs, chicken nuggets.  Black bean burgers.  Definitely well rounded.

The steak sandwich was awesome.   They cooked it exactly how I liked it.  The bread was crusty and I asked that they make it into garlic bread.   They said no problem.   They couldn't be more accommodating with changing up their menu to adjust to different tastes.  Very nice staff.

I have been here twice.  Both times, the food has been fine but the customer service has been below par.  I ordered the orange chicken with the chow mein and she asks what type of entree do I want.  Ummmm....Orange chicken, I repeat.  What kind of side.....ummm....."chow mein" I repeat.   Not a "thank you".  Not a "Please come again."  Takes the payment, shoves the food out the window, window closes.  I won't  be back either.

I'm a female who walked in this store.  Not a "hello", not a "welcome to my shop." NOTHING!!!!  I walked over and sat down.  My S/O was nice enough to drop me off since there was no close parking spots and went to park.  When "HE" walked in, he got a nice welcome. He was called "Sir."  Personally, at that point, I would have walked out and went elsewhere simply because a business should be respectful to everyone who walks thru the door.  Hence the 4 Stars vs 5 right off the bat.  As I was watching them cut hair, they were very slow and thorough.  This is definitely a man's world.  I like how they use shaving cream and a straight razor vs. an electric razor to clean up the neck.  The hot towels, I bet felt awesome. A little neck massage.  $16 for a haircut seems a little pricey until one sees the extra detail they take in doing such a nice job.  Will go again.

Family owned....used to be an OrangeLeaf but now is this great place for yogurt.  Get as much or as little as you want, top with fixings and weigh.  Good to go.  Variety of flavors to choose from.  Try it out!  Love it.  Even has Sugar free options!
