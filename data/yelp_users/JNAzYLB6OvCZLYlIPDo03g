This place could be really great, but unfortunately as of now it sucks.  First of all, I've never been to a concert venue like this with no bar...  Call me an alcoholic, but I like my beer in hand when I'm nodding my head to some obscure hipster band I've never heard of.  The outside is kind of cool- but the inside is awful!  The walls are stark white and look like those cheap walls people use to divide up apartments into more bedrooms.  There were no decorations or paintings on the wall when I went even though I thought it was supposed to be some sort of gallery.  Maybe I went on a night that they were between showings.  The space is small, but if they hired a better interior designer they could have made it work.  Unforch, it didn't.  The sound system seemed cheap also.  This place could be great if they just put in a bar, and hired a decorator.

I'm not really one to write a review on a dinky little sandwich shop in a strip mall, but I have had so many negative experiences at this place that I felt I needed to share them.  The people that work here have been beyond rude every time I have visited this Cousin's Subs.  The first time I came in I used a coupon, which seemed to piss the old guy working the counter off.  I asked to substitute one ingredient for another and was rudely told "No Substitutions!"  The workers are always impatient with the customers and always act as if I'm inconveniencing them by being in their store and giving them business.  And to top all off, their sandwiches aren't all that good!  They skimp on all of the ingredients and try to charge you extra when you ask for more.  Avoid this place and just go to Subway.  You'll get a better sandwich without the attitude.

BEST sushi and one of the best happy hours in the Phoenix area! Definitely come for happy hour as the deals cannot be beat.  My favorites are the RAckin' Shrimp and the Las Vegas roll. Both are unbelievably delicious.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it....

I never thought I would write a review about a car dealership- especially a 5 star review, but I had such a positive experience with Hyundai of Tempe that I felt inclined to do so!    I started my search for a new car at Showcase Honda, and had a truly horrible experience.  I test drove a 2012 Civic, and I liked it and wanted to see what kind of deal they would offer.  The sales men were so pushy, basically saying that if I didn't pull the trigger on their offer (which was way over MSRP) then the car wouldn't be for sale tomorrow (like they had the only Honda Civic for sale in the entire Phoenix area?).  Anyway, it left a truly bad taste in my mouth regarding car dealerships and sales people.    The next day I decided I wanted to test drive an Elantra, and a friend suggested Chapman Hyundai so I went up there, loved the Elantra, but unfortunately they only had it in a color I wasn't interested in.  On a whim I headed down to Hyundai of Tempe.  Upon arriving I saw the new 2012 Hyundai Veloster and basically fell in love with it.  I worked with sales consultant Dan Lopez who made the whole car buying experience completely stress free.  He was so easy to work with, was knowledgeable about the product, and I never felt pressured like I did at the Honda dealership.  He got me a great deal on the car, a good price for my trade, and didn't try to sell me any gimmicky dealer packages.  After reading the excellent reviews on the service department, I'm feeling confident I made the right decision in buying my car here.    I HIGHLY recommend Dan Lopez and Hyundai of Tempe!  Oh, and the car is pretty sweet too. :)

Came here for dinner based on the many positive Yelp reviews and I'm sorry to say this was the worst sushi I have ever had.  The portions were TINY and the sushi was, well, fishy. It didn't taste like the high quality sushi that I was expecting.  Plus the prices were extremely high for the quality and quantity of food received.  I guess RA and Kabuki are the only decent sushi restaurants in the Phoenix metro area.  Avoid this place and go to either of those instead!

I lived in an apartment at Legacy Bungalows for an 8 month period in 2010/2011.  The apartments themselves are nice.  Our apartment was very large for a one bedroom and it had a nice open floor plan and high ceilings.  The grounds and pool area was always well maintained.  The location is convenient to downtown, once you walk past a few blocks of sketchiness.  The management was always very friendly and was quick to repair maintenance issues.  And to top it all off the rent was dirt cheap!  So why would I not recommend the Legacy Bungalows?  Well that would be because of our fellow neighbors.  Many of the apartments are rented out as section 8/low income apartments, and it shows.  I should have been tipped off when I was signing my lease and I had to sign several documents saying I would not commit a crime or sell drugs in the apartment complex.  Some of the things I experienced while living there include being awoken at 6 am on a Sunday by someone trying to beat in my neighbors door with a baseball bat screaming, "I'm going to f-ing kill you b*tch!", people inside the dumpster rummaging through our trash several times a week, parking my car next to the most dumpy cars I've ever seen in my life, being asked several times if I "smoked" and if I wanted to buy some "weed", and having my door checked if it was unlocked by people who seem to be checking every door in the complex presumably to break in and steal things.  The door checking thing happens several times a week, making me paranoid that my door be locked at all times.    Until they stop renting to low income families and the surrounding area cleans up a little, I would avoid living here.

The food here is awful.  I live next door so I thought I would give it a try.  When I was given a menu I was told that the prices were incorrect.  I ordered a combination plate and was charged $4 more dollars than what the menu price was making it $10.  Not sure if they tell that to everyone or just me?  Thought it was a little steep for a hole in the wall Chinese place.  I would have been ok with the price if the food was good, but this was the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted.  Everything was bland.  And I wasn't sure what the meat was (chicken, pork, pigeon, rat).  Even the fried rice was bad.  Avoid this place and go to Pei Wei up the street.  The food is a million times better and less expensive!

I want to love this place.  I really do.  But time and time again my experience at this hotel is a disappointment.  Let me start with the good:  Zumanity!  Love this Circ de Soleil show located at NYNY.  Such a fun show with amazing energy by some awesome performers.  Definitely a must see if you're in Vegas.  Plus it's one of the only Circ shows you can find some great discounts for if you look around.  The Theme: As a former Manhattan resident I love the New York theme from the hotel shaped like NY skyscrapers, to the little Greenwich village inside the casino with restaurants and shops.  Location: Great location on the strip with easy access to MGM, Mandalay Bay, and City Center.  Now on to the not so good  The room: The rooms here are tiny and drab.  Plus because of the layout of the hotel it's usually a hike from the elevator to your room.  The air conditioner in our room seemed pretty weak, which left our room HOT, even with it running on "high."  In the middle of summer in Las Vegas you do not want to be sleeping on top of the sheets and blankets still sweating balls.  Also the walls are extremely THIN.  Every morning at 5:00 am I could hear the lady in the room next door talking on the phone.  And I mean, I could hear her entire conversations.  Not very conducive to sleep when you were out late.  The Pool: The pool is way to small for the size of the resort.  Also there are not enough chairs around so you usually end up without one.  And it's a BORING pool.  Nothing exciting about it.  The drinks are overpriced which is to be expected, but they are also extremely WEAK.  Prices: The rooms are about on par with the Excalibur in my mind, but the prices are usually double.  You're better off staying there than at NYNY.  The $12.95 resort fee is ridiculous, as is $14 for one ride on the roller-coaster, and $5 for a hot dog at Nathans.  I have never tried any of the other restaurants here so can't comment on them.  Bottom line: definitely check out the NYNY while you're in Las Vegas, but spend your money elsewhere.

Phoenix needs more great restaurants like FEZ!!  The inside is cute and decorated very stylishly.  The drinks were good.  The food was delicious.  The music was great.  And the service was awesome!  Highly recommended!

Love this place!! It's by far my favorite bar in the Phoenix area.  The drinks are always cheap- especially if you come on a Wednesday or Saturday when everything is 2-4-1.  They always play great music, and show the music videos on the wall as your favorite songs are playing.  Even my straight girl friends agree that this is the most fun bar in town!

2 stars because many of the people and the dogs that I've met here have been awesome and super friendly.  However, I would give the actual dog park zero stars.  There is no shade whatsoever here, so the only times I can come are at dawn, dusk, or if it happens to be cloudy.  Otherwise my dog overheats!  Plus there are no lights here so I can't bring him after dark when it's cool.  It's not landscaped so it's basically just a big fenced off field.  There are 2 areas, one for small dogs, and one for large dogs, however people bring their large dogs into the small dog area.  Even if they're not aggressive, if they are a big dog I think they should be in the big dog area. My poor little dog gets scared with these giant dogs running around him.  I'll probably continue to go here since I live so close, but definitely don't go out of your way to bring your dog here.

AVOID this place at all costs.  I've never been treated so disrespectful in my entire life.   Came here last night with 3 friends after having dinner at Squid Ink since it's the only bar in the area.  Ordered a beer for myself and 2 of my friends and was promptly told that in order to get the drinks I would need to surrender my keys.  Ok... I told them and I gave them my keys even though I didn't even bring my car here.  My friends and I ordered shots, then went on the dance floor and goofed around having a good time.  When I went to order another drink I was told by the waitress that I was "too drunk."  "Excuse me?" I asked her, "I've had 2 drinks!"  When I asked for my keys back she just flatly told me, "No." I went to find a manager and a burly doorman asked me what was my "problem." I told him my problem was I was being refused service and I just wanted to get my keys and get out of this crappy bar.  He told me I would get my keys as soon as a cab got here. I told him a cab was on the way, and that never in my life had I been treated like a common criminal for doing nothing wrong!  I told him obviously you people don't want my business and I won't ever return.  That's when the doorman told me, "That's fine, fags like you aren't welcome here." That's when I completely lost my shit.  After the cab arrived I asked for my keys back. I was told, "you're just planning on taking the cab to your car." I told him my car was at home and I needed my keys to get into my house! He finally thew the keys at me and I got the heck out of there.  I have no idea where the people come off treating someone like that.  I did nothing wrong and was called a hateful word and was treated like a common criminal. And my tab came to around $25 for 3 beers. Definitely avoid this place.

This place is like the 99 cent store of dog groomers.  Probably the cheapest dog groomer in town, but the quality and the service is definitely the worst.  I've taken my dog here twice and both times the hair is uneven all over and spots were missed.  They're either super lazy or just try to get the job done as quickly as possible.  Other grooming places let my dog run around and play with other dogs until I'm ready to pick them up, but at Dog Town they keep them all in tiny metal cages.  The reason I will never return is after getting my dog home I noticed a large cut under his arm that I know wasn't there before I took them.  Nobody said anything or apologized for cutting him.  Do your little guy or girl a favor and take him or her somewhere else!
