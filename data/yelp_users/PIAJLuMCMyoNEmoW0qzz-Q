This place is a  good , fun minded bar/restaurant . I have gone in there enough to find it consistent ,  the bar staff is super friendly and very attentive ,  The place is laid out effectively to accommodate a pretty large crowd , and by design with a high occupancy it does not feel cramped ... They have a fun version of sexual trivia on Saturday nights , good times !

I thought this place was great , First off it is extremely nice and clean inside and the atmosphere makes you feel right at home , The wait staff is polite , courteous and extremely friendly .   The menu is very well rounded .     I would recommend it .  I also appreciate that it has an extremely large patio area with outdoor bar that is also cigar friendly  as well.        I really cannot validate the negative reviews and I feel kinda sorry for those  negative minded women  , anyways I will return.  This place is great !    slainte

We went in on a week day night around 7 or so , walked directly to the bar , a young female bartender was working there and she was relatively pleasant to me , but not so much to my girlfriend Michelle ,  Michelle ordered a Shandy and after some clarification she received one , I ordered a Coord  light which were on special for 2.00 , all good , we ordered some calamari as an appetizer , it showed up , mediocre ,,, we then ordered another drink , myself another Coors Light , Michelle then opted to have a Bud Light , and proceeded to order dinner , she chose the Veal , I opted for a salad , a couple of minutes passed and the waitress returned to tell Michelle they had no Veal ,,, which was the sole reason we went there , the waitress apologized and said that they had other options but no Veal , she then said to just cancel everything and we would take the check , the bartender said she would not charge us for the Bud Light and grabbed the almost full glass and poured it down the sink .  I was somewhat taken back , and Michelle was stunned ,,, why offer to buy a drink to just take it away ??? Ultimately ,,, "One and Done for me with this place ....

This place is close to my office so I go there for lunch periodically,  The food is prepared in front of you and is always fresh and tasty.  The portions are a good size for the money , the staff is also good ,  they also offer a frequent eater card for a free entree ,
