I have been in the industry and Training myself with occasional training partners for yrs,  Then I met Craig Tinn-Man Tinnelle.   Craig has changed and hardened me more in our short time together than yrs of trying to push myself, I am prepping for a show soon but I highly Recommend Craig and Physiques Gym to anyone that is ready to take there training and conditioning to a New level. Craig knows his stuff and knows Just how to pull your best out of your Heart and Soul. Just dont give up, Get in and talk to Craig He will change your Perspective and your life.

I have never had a single billing issue, Josh and Bella are quick to fix any issue I have ever had. Not a clean place, 1 or 2 pieces of Equipment that needs fixing, Music can be to loud at times. Most will enjoy this Quote version of Hard core but I have trained in other Hardcore gyms before that were kept clean, that had toilet paper and paper towels stocked regularly and did not leave trash piled up till it was spilling over before emptying the cans. Personally I am happy to buy out my contract and go to fitness 1 or another close gym
