Love this place...ive taken about 3 cars to Niles and he never fails. I rather not have had to spend as much money as I have on repairs but he has always fixed the problem at a reasonable price! Definitely would recommend!

I went here with my wife...we ordered the new sushi they were advertising, edamame, sesame chicken and drinks. I received the sushi and it was ROTTEN!!! It tasted like it had been pre made and sat in the cooler for a few days to spoil. I notified the manager and told him that it looked like it had been sitting for a few days...THE MANAGER TOLD ME "YES, IT ACTUALLY WAS MADE A FEW DAYS AGO" OMG!!!! Are you trying to kill me? Needless to say..I will not go back...

We used to shop at this Fry's pretty much every week. The last several times we have been in it has been awful. On a few occasions the produce is sub par. On another occasion they were completely out of chicken breast...none in the store what so ever how does that happen????  On another occasion there were flys, like not 2 flys but like 50+ flys swarming the rotisserie chicken. I brought it to the attention of an employee in the selfie and I was told..."it's Arizona, it's hot and we are located next to farm land...we can't help it". OMG!!!!! REALLY!!!!  We have since started shopping at Target and Basha's.

Got this as a gift from Groupon....it was actually alot of fun...we knew we would get our butt kicked by a bunch of 12 year olds....but with that being said....they give you a 10 minute orentation about the rules which all make sense. the people managing the field do nto pay attention and inforce these safety rules. teams are not matched fairly....a bunch of 12 year olds agains a pro team....a guy on the other team stuck the barrell of his fully auto paitball gun under my face mask after he was shot out and shot me in the face. after i was out i proceeded to leave the field with my hands in the air ( as instructed) and the same guy unloaded about 15-20 rounds on me within 5 feet which again is against the rules. i questioned the guy on why he did it and he grabbed me by the shirt and proceeded to instigate a fight.  ALL OF THIS HAPPENED IN FRONT OF A YOUNG BLONDE FEMALE STAFF MEMBER WHO DID NOTHING! the staff didnt do much about this other than appologize and offer me a free visit. they contunued to let the violent gentelman stay and play when he should of been kicked out. there was also a dad and his 3 kids that  questioned the staff about the rules not being followed and they ended up leaving due to carelessness from the staff. needless to say....it would of been a ton of fun if the rules given were monotored. WILL GO TO ANOTHER PAINTBALL FACILITY NEXT TIME.

I have to eat my words....The first time we went to cheddars it was AMAZING!!!!! The last 3 times has not been good...we have waiting for over 30 minutes for food....received wrong orders...food not consistent, the food overall has not been good. Each time we go in everything tastes different..Not sure whats going on but not the Cheddars we complimented about previously, and definitely not the same Cheddars as we have experienced in other locations....
