Really Upsetting! Ive have been a loyal customers of Joe's for years now as its in our neighborhood and have always had such good service and amazing pizza...I ordered their pizza weekly! Ive always loved their greasy large super cheesy pizza. Ive noticed the last few times i have ordered the pizza was horrible, cheese was falling off everywhere, so much sauce or its not even NY Style. Tonight just really ruined it for me. I ordered my pizza and left in the comments to add ranch and buffalo. Our pizza arrived almost an hour later after the delivery man who didn't speak such good english called me 20 minutes prior to arriving asking where my exact place of residence was, i literally live 7 minutes at most from the store. When he got here, even though it stated on the receipt when delivered about the sauces the driver looked at me clueless when i asked where the sauces were. He just said its not on the receipt when it clearly states so. I sit down to eat and open up the box and the pizza is ICE COLD. Literally stale at this point. I called them to complain and was HUNG UP ON 4 TIMES IN A ROW. Horrible customer service. After calling back the woman who has an accent had a rude tone. I was transferred to the store after 20 minutes of being hung up on and being on hold numerous times. I was told the manager was to contact me tomorrow to resolve this. Its just really disappointing to see how downhill Joe's has gone in the last few months, it almost seems like its under new ownership or management because instead of calling the store directly your sent to an outbound office. I definitely wont be spending anymore money here and sadly have to find a new neighborhood pizza spot of my liking.

My boyfriend introduced me to here after moving to Scottsdale. I have seriously been missing out my entire life. My favorites are the calzone and antipasto salad. On top of it, every time I come im remembered and all the staff is so friendly and helpful. Never disappoints!

Great Service and food. Bartenders/servers are very tentative and there is never a wait. Food is out withing 10-15 minutes of ordering. One of my favorite neighborhood restaurants to grab a bite to eat and a drink.

I came here with my car extremely dirty inside and out. I have black interior and I tend to take my dog everywhere with me and she's white. So you can imagine what a mess my car looked. I wanted to get a good detail but without paying an outrageous amount. I came here and told exactly what I wanted and how much I'd pay. I got a super interior clean along with an exterior clean and wax said it would take an hour or so. $70! They did a phenomenal job, my car had absolutely no trace of dog hair and it looked like I just drove it off a car dealership lot brand new. Very impressed with these guys and they do a great job :)

Butter has always been the breakfast spot and we enjoy the amazing pancakes.  Sadly was not the greatest experience. Today we Ordered food to go and it was ready within 15 minutes. Mind you this order was $40+. We were waiting for our coffee and smoothie. My husband simply asked the lady at the counter if they had a simple syrup they would throw in the coffee for him and she continues to point to the chocolate syrup. He was Trying to explain what simple syrup was and she as was still confused. The manager instantly storms out in a hostile manner without even being prompted by your confused staff and raises his voice in front of 15 + customers(families, children, elders) as my husband is Trying to explain the situation. He REFUSED to even listen and literally pushed my husband out of the door raising his first at my husband as well as making physical threats, including "oh I would do something you wouldn't come back from" My husband was even holding open the door for two woman entering who thanked my husband for holding to the door right in front of the manager. I even asked the girl if I had called her an idiot and because the manager was literally screaming, she looked completely terrified to even answer.   I have worked many years into the restaurant industry in management and I have NEVER seen a manager treat a customer in this matter.   Especially to do this on a Sunday the busiest time of day. I am a regular weekend patron that  attended with family and business associates. Before I called into the establishment I was meeting with associates of mine.   To be completely HUMILIATED, DISRESPECTED, and EMBARRASSED in front of such a wonderful establishment is just beyond my words .....   The manager also refused to give us his name or any other employee involved. This is the shittiest customer service. They lost a regularly customer because of a power hungry manger that wants to humiliate PAYING customers. Not one time does he give the common curtesy to listen to the other end of the sorry.    Absolute pathetic. He should be reprimanded for his actions or clearly retrained on how to deal with issues that arise that may have been mis understood or some general professionalism that he seems to be purely lacking . Just so disappointing that a place held to such high standard condones poor management.  We will NEVER Be returning.

I was extremely pleased about the food,service and atmosphere! Talk about top notch customer experience. We were promptly seated in a cozy booth next to the kitchen. Jennifer our friendly server was AMAZING! She was tentative but not over baring and would always check on us at the perfect time.  All the employees were prompt to help us out weather it was a food runner, server or buser. We started off with the Italian Farm salad, grilled artichoke and a bottle of Pinot Nero. The salad was DELICIOUS, i couldn't eat it fast enough. The grilled artichoke tasted wonderful but was on the messier side to eat (super juicy) For our entree we ordered the diver scallops.... SO GOOOOOD!  They were the biggest most tender scallops I've ever had, i have been craving them ever since we left! We had the donuts and a cappuccino for dessert..... again nothing but perfect! We regularly visit the Fox Concept Restaurants but North is by far our favorite. They go above and beyond the customer experience and the food has always been incredible.

First time here today!  Henry our server was phenomenal! He is defiantly an asset to Zinburger. He made the experience wonderful and was extremely friendly. He was always on top of where our food and drinks were at all times.   I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the breakfast burger. The buffalo chicken was tasted good but the piece of chicken was huge, too big. It was a little on the harder side to eat. The breakfast burger was on point. The meat was juicy and cooked to perfection and the fried egg takes it to a whole other level of deliciousness!   The prickly pear margarita was my favorite! The make it just right, that way you dont get a straight taste of tequila. I wish i could have gotten it togo :)  Great experience and good food! we will definitely be back.

AMAZING! My boyfriend saw an interview on Fox 10 for VIVO, he decided to take me here for my birthday this weekend. We were extremely impressed with the meals, service and establishment. Our server was Luciano, he was wonderful. He really made us feel very welcomed and he was very informative on the menu. We got the antipasto board and Mozzarella tasting for an appetizer. Both were simply perfect, hands down the best mozzarella, Fior De Latte just melts in your mouth. So fresh and devine!! The meats on the antipasto board were savory and very flavorful!! For an entree we shared the Best Ever Lasagna, It was the BEST! So full of flavor, not to filling and went perfectly with our red wine. I would give VIVO 100 stars if i could. We will definitely make VIVO a date night ritual. Hands down best authentic Italian food in Arizona.

First off Qt is AMAZING! I've seriously struggled for so long to find someone that actually knows what they are doing. My nails have never looked this beautiful and I couldn't be any happier. I was referred her by my sister and I finally made an appointment. Q did EXACTLY what I asked for! He spent his time and is such a perfectionist, I love it! I've gotten nothing but complements and I cannot wait to come back

Fatty Daddy's is the new ice cream spot in my neighborhood so i had to give it a try. DANGEROUSLY GOOD! Ive been craving a cookie cup since Friday!! After trying every single flavor (because they have so many) I got a vanilla macaroon with the coffee ice cream. The cookies are soft but so chewy at the same time and the ice cream has so much flavors. The marshmallow on top is what makes the entire cookie cup. Everyone who works there is so nice and helpful. Hands down best dessert stop in Scottsdale!

These donuts are simple but incredible! I got the luxury of trying almost every single donut and not did one disappoint. Bringing these home was a nice refreshing reminder to my boyfriend who lived in Breckinridge and said daylight donuts was pretty much the only breakfast place in town! I'm glad they brought them out here, we will def be regulars.
