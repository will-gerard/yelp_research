This place is busy on the weekends. Expect a 30 minute wait. I didn't mind, but some other patrons seemed to.   Cherryblossom is very cozy, and the waiter who served us was very nice. He updated us on our orders. Service was a little on the slow side, but given the wait to get a table, I wasn't surprised.  The chicken yakisoba noodles were great, not too much sauce and plenty of chicken; the philly roll was all right--tastes just like any other. My boyfriend was disappointed that the tempura roll was rolled into tempura flakes instead of flash fried. But overall, I enjoyed the food and would like to come back.

I have flown to and from here multiple times. This place is thousands of times better than ORD (old home airport). There is free WiFi and plenty of outlets to charge your electronics in the U.S. Airways terminal. The workers are friendly and seem to enjoy what they do. The security line is actually not a pain in the neck.  The only downside is the car rental center is significantly far from the airport. The bus system to get to it is efficient though.

The reviews are so glowing. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't so great. It might have been because my emotions were all over the place that day.  The veterinarian was good; she was told me ahead of time how much the x-rays would cost for my cat. I obliged to the cost as well as set up a payment plan for them. It turned out my cat had broken his leg, and the surgery to fix it would cost $2500+. She gave me time to think. I just sat there and cried. I couldn't afford to do this, even with payments.  The vet tech came in with my cat's prescriptions. She didn't ask, "What's wrong?" even if it's obvious I'm upset over something. Instead, she just went through the motions of telling me how to give my cat pain medicine and demonstrated how to draw it up in a syringe. She left the room without saying anything else. I cried even more. I'm sure the staff has seen these kinds of situations many times, but wow; she never even looked at me.  I went to pay at the front desk, and the vet tech came out, said "He will be OK", looked down at the cat carrier, and then walked away. No, my cat didn't end up OK. I had to give him up to the humane society because I couldn't afford to give him the help he needed.   I'm in healthcare; when I see someone upset or crying, I at least acknowledge their feelings. I can't always do anything about it, but even an open-ended "I'm sorry" would have helped some.   The surgeon spoke to me over the phone, telling me my options. He sounded like he cared, and he never even saw my cat like the other staff did.   The staff is competent; but aside from the surgeon, they lack basic customer service and compassion.

I have been to Sprouts twice, and I'm liking it more and more as I go. I like it a whole lot better than Whole Foods; there is no hot food bar, sushi station, or grill to distract me from what my main purpose is--to go grocery shopping. There is a deli, but I'm cool with that.  Most items are easy to find, and prices are reasonable. The sales are decent on certain items like olive oil, juice, vegetables, etc. Now, I'm not one of those gluten-free, vegan, quinoa-eating type of people; I'm just trying to steer away from corn syrup, MSG, and preservatives. Sprouts is the perfect place to embark on such a task.

I went here to buy a gift for a family member. I have to say that this place is very upscale to the point I feel guilty even being here, like I don't belong or something. But nonetheless, the workers were friendly and helpful. The store is beautiful; even the produce aisle looks cute with everything so artfully decorated in certain patterns.   I agree that some of the prices for run of the mill items were marked up at ridiculous prices. I guess the store can justify the cost the imported items.   It's a very nice place to find gourmet gifts or that certain ingredient you need for a nice meal...but I couldn't imagine anyone going here to buy a full grocery list's worth of items.

I had a very good experience here. Prices are very reasonable; I think I paid $35 for a shampoo, dry, cut, and style. I have a phobia of hair cuts or trims, but I chose to have my hair chopped off 8 inches. The stylist was very sweet and made my hair "fit" my round face. Appointment was on time, and even though another client came early and was expecting to see my stylist right then and there, the stylist did not rush to finish. I will for sure come back.

I brought my boyfriend here for a belated birthday celebration. We went on a Monday and were able to get discount tickets through Amazon Local. Coming from the Chicago suburbs, I was pleasantly surprised how easy of a drive it was to get there and how quiet the zoo was. Brookfield or Lincoln Park Zoo is usually busy with some class trip or tourists visiting the area. But we got a clear view of all the animals and weren't being run over by agitated moms and their strollers.   I like how some of the habitats mix various animals together instead of separating them. There is some construction going on, and the zoo appears to be making some nicer exhibits for the panthers and sea lions. It's also cool to see the baby animals in the nursery because a lot of zoos usually keep them out of sight until they are ready to be put in the habitats.   There are some zoo animals you can pet if you get close enough and don't have to pay extra to do so. You do pay extra for rides, a train, or the lift that goes above the park, but those are all optional and you can get around find without them.

This is my favorite antique mall to go to. It is immaculate in cleanliness for a store of its kind. There are helpful staff scattered throughout.  I agree with Lauren A that you don't just browse quickly; you have to set a good chunk of your day aside if you want to check everything out. This place kind of reminds me of a museum, the way sections are divided up and all. I found found some sweet Pyrex on the cheap; but you really need to glean the store because some people inflate the prices to ridiculous heights ($300 for a used set? Really?). I don't blame the mall though; just the sellers who have unreasonable expectations.  There are promotions for holidays, some weekends, etc for 10-15% off; or individual sellers might offer a discount at their own discretion.

It's a shame my experience sucked, but to be honest we didn't come during any events at the restaurant, and we came in a large group. Also I didn't choose to eat here; we were here for a celebration.  No one sat us; we arranged tables ourselves outside. A waiter eventually came 10 minutes later to get our drink orders.  Prices for the food are too high, especially since the quality is bad. I had the BBQ burger, and there was a dot of barbecue sauce imprinted in the bun, none on the burger. The sauteed onions sat in a pool of grease on top of the burger. The sweet potato waffle fries ($2 extra) were soaked in oil, so bad that it took 2-3 napkins just to soak up some of the grease off of one piece. I ate the burger because I was very hungry, but it wasn't any good. My friend ordered chicken fingers, and for $8 she got 4 measly-looking pieces.   I don't know where all the good reviews are coming from. Maybe they have good bands play or good drinks that I don't know about; but the food is absolutely terrible.

Yes, I am writing a review on Home Depot. My life is very boring and at a slow point at the moment. I'm also dumb as a sack of bricks when it comes to big home improvement stores and hate going to them. I worked at an Ace Hardware and loved it---so I'm biased.   I went here to buy a water dispenser because 1) I didn't want to sign up for a water delivery service and 2) I also didn't want to order one online and wait for that to be delivered.  I asked the guys in the appliance department where I could find them, since the website said there were 4 of the type I wanted. One of the guys said, "We are a smaller store and don't usually carry those, but you could ask the service desk". I did, and the girl there said, "Uhhh, I don't know what he was talking about, they're in aisle 13, I'll send someone to help you". The kid that was supposed to help me didn't show up. So I stood there like an idiot for a while and then finally someone else arrived and threw the dispenser in my cart.  Oh, and rarely didn't anyone make eye contact with me. Four or five employees passed me by before anyone asked if I needed help with anything. The store wasn't that busy at all.

Bagels are delicious. Cookies are yummy. Cheesecake is amazing. It's on the way to work and a great little shop to stop in for a quick bakery run for coworkers or a little gift for the nurses at Banner Boswell (wink wink, nudge nudge).

What a little Asian gem among these parts. I didn't have much of a chance to try different pho joints back in Illinois, and I imagine there aren't too many here. But nonetheless, Little Saigon has great pho. We had the beef pho; broth was flavorful, and the option to put in as many or little veggies as you want was nice. My boyfriend said the combination fried rice was possibly the best he ever had. We had enough leftovers for two more meals.

This location is g-h-e-t-t-o. The clientele are like people of Walmart; I saw four people shopping in pajamas and slippers. The selection is not as good as the one on Grand or the one on 67th Ave. Of all things, the alcohol section has the most variety.

Maybe it's because I am weary and finally at the end of my moving journey. This La Quinta location was the best of the 4 locations we have stayed at. Marissa was very helpful at the desk despite it being a busy evening for her. The room was very clean and spacious for our pets. Also I didn't hear any nearby traffic.  The elevator is either nonexistent or hard to find, but I can overlook that...not sure if handicapped people would.

It's been well over a year since I have been here, but I sure miss it.  My boyfriend and I have been here several times and it became our spot when we were in AZ. Our favorite dish is the trio of tempura, teriyaki salmon, and California rolls. Also the tempura rolls are yummy and I cannot find anything that comes close to them in Illinois. Service was quick, but I don't recall anyone being that friendly. Prices were reasonable too, portions ample.

I've been here a handful of times. It's great coffee and a nice space to hang out in. They feature certain flavors or roasts occasionally (current one is coconut caramel sandies). The staff is laid back and friendly; they actually look like they enjoy what they do. I didn't notice anything ripped, broken, or taped down inside the shop.  I like the blended white chocolate mocha and caramel iced coffee. Neither were too sweet and the coffee is smooth, not bitter.

My boyfriend's mom ordered some Barro's Pizza for us one time, and I ordered again at our place. It pretty much tastes like Jet's Pizza from back home, and I love it. Lots of cheese and the crust is nice and soft. The prices are very reasonable too--there is always specials and coupons floating around.

It was all right. My boyfriend had a craving for fish and chips, but we were too lazy to drive anywhere. This place delivered, and it delivered fast; about half an hour. The fries were too salty, and the dinner came with three small pieces of fish. I would like to try a pizza off their menu sometime, since those sound good.

As advertised, I was able to have my tire repaired for free. My tires are fairly new (8 months old) and they didn't try to convince me to replace the bad one. I did get my tires rotated, and the price was reasonable.  Despite being very busy, they finished my car in about an hour.

I've ordered delivery from Sardella's three times. I've given them chances to hopefully not have this problem over and over. But I have to post about it.  Every time my boyfriend and I order wings, the sause sloshes out of the boxes and all over the bag. Each time, the delivery guy said "Oh wow, lots of sauce in that one". No apology for how screwed up and messy everything was.   Next time, I'm either picking up or not ordering at all. It sucks because the cheesy bread and wings are really good. But delivery is terrible.

So, after my negative feedback, it looks like wing delivery has improved greatly. The sauce no longer gets all over the delivery bag. The garlic cheesy bread continues to be delicious. Thanks for listening to me, Sardella's.

I was craving some Filipino food without having to make it myself. I assumed that there wouldn't be many Filipino places near me; but a two-second search through Yelp proved me wrong.   I ordered a variety of stuff to get a general feel of what this place has to offer (no, I didn't eat it all---I have lots of leftovers to enjoy later). I ordered the chicken adobo, pancit palabok, and 3 types rolls--guava with cheese, ube, and plain cheese fillings.  I agree that the food has a home-cooked feel, so do not expect some fancy or gastro-pub meal. The adobo tasted great, just like how my mom makes it. There were sides of pancit and rice; both tasted fresh. I wasn't particularly fond of the pancit palabok; there was too much egg in it, but I'm real picky when it comes to preparing the dish.  I ate a third of the roll with the guava and cheese filling. It was delicious! There is a sweet cheese and guava jelly that melts together well with the flaky crust. I imagine if I had this when it was freshly baked or even heated up, I would have enjoyed it more. I have yet to try the other two, but I think I will like them too.   The two people who took my order and packaged everything up were really nice. Then there was the one remark 99.9% Filipinos say to me, "But you're so tall!" One of them told me to come to karaoke on Fridays to make friends; haha, cute. The restaurant looks like a Filipino home that happens to have a couple of bakery displays. So again, nothing fancy but I'm OK with that.

I ordered off of PapaJohns.com (worldwide). I ordered cheesy bread and wings. It all arrived in 30 minutes. The bread was decent; not as good as Sardella's though. The Honey Chipotle wings were hot, slightly crispy, and pretty much what I expected from wings. I made sure I gave the driver a big tip.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1ElpE-THkRE  Papa bless.

I sometimes miss Portillo's of the Chicagoland area. I was more a fan of the fries, shakes, and burgers--not so much the hot dogs or Italian beef. However, Lenny's fills that gap in my life. It is not to say this is a dupe of Portillo's; yes, it has similar decor and menu, but Lenny's carries its own weight.  The shakes come in the usual flavors; but my favorite is the horchata shake. I've had others, but Lenny's figured a way so it doesn't taste like a cinnamon vanilla candle.  Burgers are great and ample-sized; I really can't tell the difference between regular mayo and their ranch mayo though. Toppings are plenty, but they use shredded lettuce. The fries are nice and crispy; I think they use beer-battered ones, but don't quote me on that.  They charge an extra 30 cents to use a debit or credit card. It's better to carry cash when you go here.

Recommendations:  1) fried alligator--you have to try it at least once in your life 2) gulf coast oysters--shucked right at the bar 3) cajun bloody mary 4) stuffed shrimp montage  Pass: 1) cheesecake --it wasn't bad; but it is probably better to try one of the other unique desserts like the praline bread or banana wafer puddings 2) cedar plank salmon--my friend's salmon came out mostly raw, even when reheated  This place was pretty frickin' sweet. I haven't enjoyed a dining experience quite like this one in a long time. I savored our meal and had a great time. Our server Rich went above and beyond to make sure things went right.

An elderly woman with a back hump in the handicapped spot and smoking a cigarette gave me the old stink eye...I did not feel welcome here. But the inside staff was inviting, warm, and friendly to the point my worries melted away. Food is pretty good so I can't complain. I recommend the chicken-fried steak with biscuits and gravy. That'll put you in a nice coma for your afternoon nap. 4/5 would eat here again.

I gave this place a try because I was fed up with LF Oriental Market's disorganized aisles.  Lee Lee's is huuuuuge, and very...spacious. The aisles are triple width and there is a corner of the store that is empty. I feel like I'm in a convention center.  There is a boba stand that also makes sushi (?? random) and banh mi sandwiches. the boba I had was good. There is also a restaurant but I didn't really look at it other than seeing a bunch of booths as I passed by.   The prices are reasonable and slightly lower than LF's.

CAFEPINO is becoming one of my favorite restaurants.  You can come here for any full sit-down meal, a quick lunch, or just enjoy a coffee and pastry. Both the indoor and outdoor seating areas are lovely.   Everything I have tried here is great: creme brulee, the drinks (both alcoholic and non), and the pizza. The salmon topped pizza has fresh salmon on it; none of that canned business. Service is top notch; people are quick to refill drinks, check on how we're doing, and make great suggestions from the menu.   As Victoria mentioned, there are gluten-free options, and the staff was very accommodating to any variations to the meals.

Food is generally good. You get ginormous portions and I noticed people tend to share plates because of that. They serve four peaks 8th street ale.  I like what I had (curry chicken salad), but if you're not open to trying vegetarian/vegan options or Mediterranean inspired food, then you probably won't like this place.

My sister and I ended up here after trying to find a restaurant that was open during the Super Bowl (ahh, America...your restaurants and shops are open on almost all holidays but not Super Bowl Sunday). Arrowhead Grill was quiet, but that was expected. The staff was very nice and didn't rush us even though we were there past closing time. We ordered some light food because we weren't in the mood for a heavy meal. Even the simple things we ordered were presented in a cool manner. I got the s'mores dessert which came me with a teeny tiny fire pit on the plate and homemade marshmallows. I would love to come back for another special occasion.

I was walking around the area and stumbled upon this place. I was planning a trip to a French bakery in the next month or so for macarons, but I didn't have to after finding KAK. I bought 2 of each of the Nutella, vanilla, and strawberry. So far, the vanilla is my favorite. I didn't find them stale or dry at all; they were perfect and the filling was soft and smooth.   I would love to order a cake from here someday--maybe for someone's birthday. The pictures look yummy.

I had an appointment that was pushed back 45 min utes. I was famished and needed something filling and quick. I saw a Burger King, a couple of grocery stores, a Chipotle (I think), and this place. I beelined for Cafe China. Chinese food would fill my empty stomach tank just fine.  I was seated right away and the server (maybe owner) was very kind. She got my order right after getting my drink. The soup came out in less than a minute, sesame chicken lunch special in about five. I chowed down on piping hot, seemingly fresh food. The sesame chicken had the same "base battered meat" as sweet and sour chicken, so I was a little disappointed in that. But the portions were perfect--enoguh to fill me up, not put me in a food coma like most Chinese food does.   I was done eating within 20 minutes and made it back to the appointment with no problems. I hope to try this place again.

I have ordered from here twice. First time was our first night in Arizona; my boyfriend and I were tired, starving, and smelly. I ordered the sesame chicken dinner special and crab puffs. Boy, they both hit the spot and it all was the right amount of food--not too much, not too little.  The second time I ordered the same thing, but the quality sucked. The breading was soggy, and the container was barely full. Also the eggrolls are nasty but they gave me one instead of the drink that I asked for on the phone. When I asked, "may I have my drink?" the girl (who didn't take the order) said, "You can only have an eggroll or a drink. You got an eggroll" *points to bag*. And that was that.    I'm not going back except in a time of desperation or intoxication.

I was really hoping this place would be great, based on the good reviews.   Our group did go a little on the later side, about 8:30 p.m. We waited almost an hour for our dinner to arrive. We did get drinks and appetizers to pass the time. The stuffed mushrooms and bruschetta were very good. A lot of the things we ordered weren't really what we expected though--the wine ordered was not the correct red wine; I got a salad when I asked for soup; we didn't get bread, the pasta was very al dente, almost hard; and I asked for linguine in my dish (spaghetti Vesuvani) but they used spaghetti anyway. I don't like to complain much, but there was a whole lot of wrong that went into that meal.   The restaurant is not very easy to find; unless you know exactly where you are going, it is easily missed. The only sign is among a group of other names like most plazas/strip malls.

I went here for an open house type event with my boyfriend and family. I had  fun and it was therapeutic painting some pottery. I've only been to two pottery places in my life, this one and another one in Illinois. The condition of the building was pretty awful. There was dust everywhere; it was so thick that I had to go outside a few times due to coughing fits. Maybe this is typical of a pottery joint, but the one I went to before was way cleaner than this place. The outside area looks like a junkyard of pottery pieces scattered throughout the property.  We told one of the workers multiple times we were done and ready to pay...she pretty much ignored us or said "OK" for over half an hour and was busy cleaning up tables.   I liked how my mug turned out, but the paint cracked all over despite that I put on 3-4 coats. My boyfriend's turned out fine.

I had been interested to try El Pollo Loco for some time, as it looked like a better alternative to Taco Bell. Nope, this was not the case.  I went through the drive- through. Even though it was only 11:15, the order taker said, "We're out of fajitas". How is that even possible? I asked for a little time so I could think of what to order, and then someone a different person took my order. Based on the way he dressed, I think he was the manager. I watched him put a container of macaroni and cheese with a moderate amount of sauce dripping down the side in the bag. So all containers, napkins, and foil wraps in the bag were covered in sauce while he handed it to me; I could SEE it all through the bag. I just grabbed everything and left. How can I complain to the manager when he is the one who did it?  As far as the food goes...the beef torta was super soggy; I only ate 1/4 of it. The macaroni and cheese was ok, but I couldn't differentiate between this and Chinese buffet Mac n cheese.

I rather enjoyed trying this place with the company of my friend and her family.  They ordered everything for us so I don't know the names of everything we had; but everything I tasted was great. We had a mix of meat and vegetarian dishes. I typically don't like bacon-wrapped things, but there were bacon-wrapped dates which was my favorite tapa. Too bad it's not on the menu, but I might have luck asking for it in the future.  The staff was very accommodating as we ate a late dinner (after 8:45 pm). Dishes came out quickly and at a steady pace. I will gladly come back.

I went here last week with my boyfriend and his family. The prices are a steal. Half off rolls--I was sold. But it was very easy to order a lot and fill up quickly. I was a bit trigger happy and the bill still ended up the same as the places I order back home. Nonetheless, I left full and stayed full for a long time.  We ordered the dragon, Philadelphia, California, rainbow, thunder, and crunchy rolls. They were way more than enough for 2 people.   Only thing that sucked was we asked the waitress to change the channel on the TV, and she had no clue what we were asking. So she just changed the channel to a random basketball game. Other than that, I'd go back in a heartbeat.

I find it laughable what one of the reviewers below said. $8.99 is nothing in comparison to the prices at Stir Crazy in Illinois and other similar concepts, but I guess ignorance is bliss. Not to mention piling up a bowl like that with the raw meat on top cheats the restaurant as it is technically another meal. But I digress.  Genghis Grill is a casual Mongolian stir fry joint, similar to Pei Wei or the hibachi station at an Asian buffet. There are a good variety of meats and veggies to choose from. I understand why the sauces have to be attended; I wouldn't put it past a stupid customer to dip a finger in a sauce otherwise. Not to mention if you put too much sauce, the amount of sugar in certain sauces can burn and screw up the meal.  I pieced together a meal of udon noodles with chicken, veggies, and honey soy sauce. I enjoyed it and can't complain--a regular size bowl left me stuffed.  The waitress was nice and prompt with our requests, although another one came by later and kept saying "K" after the two things we asked for.   Overall, I like the place since you can control the amounts of which ingredients go into your meal. Despite it being Friday evening, there wasn't a terribly long wait and our food came back cooked quickly.

After two hours of sleep and a flight from Chicago back to Arizona, I was very hungry and wanted breakfast within a 5 miles radius of the airport. I found this place off of Mill St, right by a Valley Metro stop.   The interior is a mix of IKEA and Chipotle. You order at the counter, get a metal letter placard for your table so the staff can bring out your food, and you fill your own drinks. I don't mind that at all; but it seemed like 75% of the college students coming in were confused about the concept. They would huddle around the registers looking at the menu brochures, look up bewildered at the menu on the upper wall, and then look down at their brochures again. The workers would get frustrated by this and ask over and over, "I can take someone's order here when they are ready" to get these kids moving.   Anyway, that's not a point against the restaurant at all--just warning you what to expect.  I ordered the strawberry pancakes and grilled potatoes. I wolfed down as much as I could--everything tasted fresh, and you can tell the potatoes weren't frozen. I didn't find anything bland--the pancakes didn't need any zest to them.The prices are a little on the higher end compared to a diner, but you are getting really good, really fresh food; not frozen, unpredictable crud from a Denny's.

Nice little Mexican joint within a hotel. The menu is limited, but my group enjoyed everything we ordered. The street tacos were pretty good. The mezcal mule wasn't; too sweet, but I didn't say anything so I could have asked for another. Parking is limited, but that's just how it is in Old Town. It is conveniently located by all the shops and bars.

I was a dumb butt and couldn't put two and two together that this is an Asian coffee shop until I saw Boba tea on the menu, a Balikbayan box in the corner, and a huge picture with a Jeepney in it. But anyway, I wanted some caffeine that wasn't Starbuck's so I went here. The barista did a great job handling the 10 or so orders that came after mine. I ordered the Red Velvet Frost, which I assumed had espresso in it because it was under the espresso category. I drank it; it was pretty much tasted a piece of red velvet cake blended into icy goodness without lumpy, soggy crumbs. I loved it, but there was no joe in the cup. For that, I have to take away a star. But dang, that was one yummy drink.

Yes, there is a "eat at your own risk" type warning for the smoked salmon. I unfortunately developed food poisoning after eating the honey-glazed smoked salmon sandwich last month. I was chained to the porcelain throne from 4 pm to 4 am and had to miss a day of work. It was pretty much a bagel with pieces of smoked salmon and chopped onion/tomato on top of a bagel. No cream cheese was put on it (which would probably help anchor down the ingredients), and the whole thing fell apart on first bite.   The workers are friendly and the drinks are fine; but I'm never coming back here.

I noticed the quality, quantity, and service have gone down significantly since I started going here six months ago.  The last time I went, the burrito my boyfriend ordered was half the size it typically is. Mine fell apart while the girl was making it, but she kept going so when I opened the foil, all the ingredients fell out of the tortilla.The cashier was quick to take my money, but she ignored our burritos waiting to be bagged. Four burritos piled up, waiting to be bagged, while she stood there blankly staring into space.   No one says a simple "hi" anymore, just "burrito or bowl?" and no "have a nice day". It appears the workers don't care about their job.

I'm another one of those who didn't like bundt cakes until I tried these. My boyfriend's aunt was kind enough to give me some slices back around Super Bowl weekend.   I went in today  to get 3 bundtlets, two in cinnamon swirl and one in red velvet. The people working there were very friendly and glad to help. There is a seasonal flavor, peanut butter chocolate, which I sampled. I like how the bundtlets come in a convenient, resealable container. It's way less messier than eating a cupcake or regular piece of cake.  @DaniJ, when you are on a cell phone the same time that you're trying to order something, chances are you messed up what you said, and that's why you ended up with what you got. I can't tell you how many times I've seen that same situation. :P

The service wasn't great because of a lot of mixups. Our waitress tried very hard though. Three different waitresses brought out our appetizer, entree, and dessert. A  different one came to us with an artichoke dip that we didn't order; later, she walked around with our dessert, looking for the right table to deliver it and walked right past us. We received the wrong bill. The waitress didn't put our dessert on the bill, then added it and charged for it afterwards. I ended up with three different receipts. My boyfriend said the wings are not as good as they used to be; too much breading. I had a chicken apple walnut salad which was decent, but not for over $12. The dessert cookie was really good; no complaints on that. Oh, and there was a fruit fly in my water at the very beginning. I didn't say anything because I figured that was the worst of it, but the rest of the night wasn't redeeming.  I really like supporting local companies and brands, but next time I'm going to Buffalo Wild Wings.

Man, people are picky with the prices! I don't know what day you all went, but I went midweek and scored some good deals.  I got a like new computer chair for $20 and a small file cabinet with no dings in it for $10. I also purchased some smaller items for my bathrooms ranging from 99 cents to $3. All in all, I came away with some great stuff.   The showroom is very clean and spacious. There isn't a lot in there, but I am not looking to furnish my whole home at this time; just a few odd and ends needed.  The prices are comparable if not the similar to other used furniture stores in the Glendale/Peoria/Phoenix area.

Yep, this is gonna be our new go-to place for sushi. It's small, the staff is very friendly, and it's a block away from our home.  I had the Philly, golden California, Dragon, and Volcano rolls. It was too much; I didn't expect the rolls to be so big. I schlopped off as much as I could to my boyfriend, but he could barely finish his salmon teriyaki Bento box. We left stuffed and with plenty of leftovers. Next time I will just stick to two rolls.

We went here again on a quiet Wednesday evening. We got our sushi in the boooooat! I ordered one less roll and I was still full. I tried the Las Vegas roll this time and it was delicious. 5 rolls for $25---can't beat that.

Amazing stuff! The ribs are so tender and the smoke/rub makes them perfect without any sauce. The beans are tangy and I could eat a whole bowl of them. The cole slaw has its own unique twist. $11 a plate, but you can have as little or as much as you want. The owners and workers are very kind and outgoing; they came out and talked to us after we ate. The location isn't very noticeable from the main road (no lit sign), but the owner said they hope to install one next month.

Custard is amazing. Ice is amazing. The gelati is ambrosia of the gods. All day I dream about Rita's.

I can see why this place is so busy. I went here with my boyfriend, his cousin, and his cousin's girlfriend. The wait wasn't terribly long, and while we waited we were served drinks--clever idea. The restaurant itself is small, probably better suited for a fast food joint; this is is probably why it's appears so full. There is an outdoor patio, but it doesn't add a whole lot to the limited space.  Anywho, I'm not the biggest fan of pizza/pasta joints; but for my first Arizona pizza, this place was top notch. We ordered the antipasto (my tablet autocorrected that to angioplasty, lmao) and 18 inch half numero one-o and pepperoni pizza. I can't stand pepperoni pizza, but this was the best one I ever tried. It had the perfect crust, cheese, and right amount of sauce without the pepperoni overwhelming everything. My boyfriend is picky about his salad, but he gobbled up quite a bit of the antipasto. The baked cookie dessert was yummy and a great size for four stuffed people just to cleanse the palate a little.  With plenty of leftovers, our bill came out to under $50 (not including drinks from the wait). Good deal.

I went here with a group of 7 and a set of twin infants. We sat on the patio. The manager and server were quick and very accommodating. Table service was fast on a Sunday night. The carnitas were amazing; the pork adobada was awful-- too salty and...gritty? It was strange. The server was generous in taking it off our bill. Roasted veggies has a spicy creamy sauce on them I didn't like, but I ate around it. I sampled the Orange cucumber salad, and it was refreshing. They make a decent Bloody Mary; based on feedback from the rest of the group, the margaritas and mojitos were a group favorite.   The misters were turned on per our request, and the babes were happy and cool.   Parking is godawful, but it's not easy to find it on Central on any given day.

Overall, I liked it here. It's a small space, but not many people were there. The workers were very attentive. They gave my sister and I a free tasting of cucumber salad and grapefruit slices for dessert. Prices are reasonable; I ate 3 rolls for $20. The sushi was very fresh. The option to tip before receiving food and service was a bit off-putting. I also found it kind of odd to mix sushi with coffee (they also serve coffee, tea, and blended iced drinks), but maybe it works for some people. I didn't try the coffee.

I agree with others that this would have been more entertaining and fun if I were younger.   I knew there would be many children, so I went in with that expectation. In reality, the adults and teenagers were much harder to deal with. Two forty-something year old women stood in line behind my boyfriend and me and they shouted as if they were at a concert. They would not shut up about every little thing they observed and kept butting into other people's conversations. Long story short...these kinds of events attract idiots and people of all walks of life. So brace yourself for an airport-like experience.  The entire event was rather boring and full of long lines. It focused on the Avengers characters; but for political correctness, they threw in the Black Panther and the "strong woman type" She-Hulk.   None of the registration kiosks were open. So it seems they never fixed their IT issues. The technology is a bit dated, and to be honest a lot of the interactive games were of same quality as DisneyQuest in Chicago (closed since 2001). Seeing the Cox logo on a screen was in bad taste. I'm surprised I didn't see more sponsorship logos around.   It's not worth the drive, headache, or money to go. I would rather drive to Universal Studios Florida from AZ and stand in their lines for some decent thrill rides than this load of crap.

The employees are easy-going and kind. Coffee is pretty good. It's a quiet spot and a nice corner tucked in the area. Agreed that parking is not great; but that's a fault of the plaza layout, not the shop's.
