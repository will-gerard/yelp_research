Horrible food, my third visit and extremely over-priced. I was there this week for a medical group and the waiter suggested the bone in Kona Crusted dry aged sirloin which was so tough I could not chew it and each bight was gristle and fat. I had to discretely put each bight in my napkin before I gave up on the meat. I wanted the filet but he told me the sirloin was better (e gads). Honestly I wouldn't even take it home to my dog. I considered doing this with the bone but felt that the gristle and fat would do her harm.  The manager tried to make good and apologized and gave me two coupons for $25 off (which wouldn't cover the tip on the next visit). It would have been nice for a waiter to make eye contact with us so I could have flagged him over to order a hamburger. Because I of this I went without dinner this evening - actually I ate a hog dog at 9:30 PM and that was dinner.  Do your self a favor and book your next reservation at Morton's 480-951-4440 or Ruth's Chris (602) 957-9600 which is across the street if you want a good steak.

The best home made sausage in town. Great Kielbasa and other cold-cuts and sausages.

I went in to do some SEO work for the Doc and traded him my SEO site development for acupuncture on my back and it really worked great for pain relief. Painless except for one needle but it really fixed my back. Dr. Scott Carmachel did the work and was very gentle and professional.

Texas Road House has some of the best ribs I have ever eaten! Their steaks are marginal but the ribs and pulled pork are to die for. The portions are very generous and I really like the bucket of peanuts on the table; Oh I forgot to mention the hot rolls melt in your mouth and the chili is the absolute best in the world. You can go and eat a bowl of chili and rolls and make it a meal!

Surprisingly every time I have been at this store the sales people know what they are talking about and if I need to return something they do it without a hassle. The sales reps actually make good recommendations. I would seldom give a big box store a high rating but this store has got its ship together.

awful Mexican food - if you could call it Mexican food. They must be known for their happy hour because the food is awful even the chips and salsa are horrible. I am amazed they are still in business.

They haven't changed the menu in 20 years and the portions are small and the food is not real good. They ought to visit Dick's Hideaway to understand what real good food is. The brunch has a nice atmosphere and the best item on the brunch menu is the coffee.

The service is impersonal, inattentive (bordering on rude) and we often have to request new seating because they try to fill their back room which is cold and empty. Steaks are good but not great, limited menu, most disappointing aspect of the entire experience is the attitude of the food servers. We have dined here dozens of times.  Additionally when you are paying $100 a plate you would expect some sort of dress code instead of people in flaps, tee shirts,  and shorts.   They do have good creme brulee! Sorry I don't like to write bad reviews but things haven't changed at this chop house and my last experience was the straw to break the camels back. We're ack to Morton's.

Great place to go shooting, ventilation is excellent which is very important, several rangers for safety, excellent inventory for sale including clothing, ammo and guns. Gun rentals are reasonable so if you are looking for a nice Red-Neck date this is the place!

Awful, looks great but all the food is thrown into a bucket so everything has the crab taste. The crab is wimpy and more like crawdads and the ambiance is more of a indoor picnic area than restaurant. It was hard to even get one good piece of crab to dip into some butter after paying a good price for the King Crab special. I have given the place 3 tries and finally gave up. Sorry.

I brought my car in to the Tempe Store at Elliot and McClintock for very slow leaking flat, oil change, and tire rotation. When I picked it up they at first were startled at the question "Did you find the leak?" Then told me there was no visible signs of a foreign object in the outside of the tire. Heck I knew that as I told them it leaks 2lbs a week. I asked them why they didn't take the tire off the rim (since they would have to do so to fix the leak) and they said to go to Discount Tire. When I asked how long to check the two managers said the crew is at lunch. Know these men are promoted from the ranks and could have checked the leak themselves. Due to their laziness, they have lost my business and I am going to check the oil level and filter to make sure they are full and snug. I am sorry I know the owner personally but if he doesn't know of these situations his business will dry up. If his managers have an attitude of sending me down the road to another competitor with a careless attitude - he might have his answer to the profit margins at his shop. Sorry Joel

Great and personal service, the owner does all the work and will get the job done. Price is right and advice is free. Great camera shop to get your DSLR cleaned or repaired.

The worst service I have ever had. I brought my camera in on a Tuesday because there were fibers and dust on the view finder, I showed this to the clerk and he saw them as well and said "OK we need a cleaning which will cost about $65". I said do it. I came in on Saturday got home and the view finder still had the dust, it was better but still quite visible just below the center focus point. I brought it in and the salesman blew around and only broke the larger piece of dust into smaller pieces. I left it for the tech to clean. Later a gal called and said she was refunding the money because they cleaned the sensor and not the view finder. I never asked for the sensor to be cleaned, yet the view finder did look better but not good enough. I went back picked up the camera got home and they took the 32 gb disk out of the camera and didn't put it back in. So here we are at 3:30 on our way back down to Tempe camera to pick up the 32 GB disk. If the disk wasn't a $25 disk I would lave left it to them as a gift.   They really blew it that I didn't want the money back I wanted a camera cleaned and in this day and age of social media - an apology for work that was not done correctly by expensive trained technicians is not a good idea. Never the less I will watch on youtube a tutorial how to clean the mirror. I already know how to clean the image sensor (takes one swab with some fast drying solution on it and that is it!).  Sorry Tempe camera, I waited all week and your tech should have checked his work before he said it was ready to go and since I have a photo shoot on Monday I can't wait until Tuesday when the tech gets back in. I have already spent over $30 on gas and my entire Saturday on this silly project. I took it home and blew the dust off with an $8 air blower.

I have dined at the store in Scottsdale and the food and atmosphere was very good. I am glad that the pizza we ordered was a bit more traditional than the fresh muzzarella and basil style pizza that I have had before.

Not only is the food piping hot but the flavor is the best among most of the Mexican food restaurants that I frequent (too often). I love the food and atmosphere and the menu is great and unique. I would recommend that anyone try this restaurant just once so you can say that you dined at the best Mexican food restaurant in AZ.

Absolutely the most unique "New Mexico style food and the portions will come home in a doggy bag. Try the Carne Avodada from the brunch menu. This is also where George W. Bush eats when he is in town (is that a plus or minus?). We were there one night when Bush came in with McCain and there was a rent-a-mob out front. Boy those Left-wingers know how to organize, I will give them that much credit.

Great restaurant and service; their menu changes quarterly but will often improvise off the old menu if you request it. Also the steak is the same quality as Flemings for about half the cost

Best steak and service I have had in Phoenix! The filet is about 2 inches thick and you thinks you are cutting through butter. The service is impeccable an and the atmosphere is fantastic. I believe Mastro's food and service are a cut above Morton's and Ruth's Chris. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone. The price is about $100 a place which takes into account a salad and side dish but worth every penny.

Best Southwestern food in the Valley - Dick's Hideaway was part of Richardson's. They have the very best New Mexico style food especially the Carne Avodada breakfast dish. Service is always good and the atmosphere is great which is essential for fine dining. To bear this out; PF Changs opened a spin off Asian restaurant that was about 5,000 s.f. and almost never filled up. Because of this "cafeteria" atmosphere, even though the food was identical to PF Chang's it didn't taste as good and the experience was not there. Goes to show that PF Chang's and Oregano's have got it down. They have good food and are limited in seating so that they are always full and on a wait which really adds to the atmosphere.

very helpful and does excellent repair work at very affordable prices. Good selection of inventory as well. Probably the most reasonable fees for repair and replacement work in the Valley.

Horrible service, ambiance, menu. Not what you'd expect from an Italian restaurant where the check was over $100 without drinks. Menu was very limited and the quality of the food was poor at best.

Best Chicago pizza and the chicken wings are all drumsticks. My wife and I used to travel back to Chicago every year and we still couldn't find Pizza as good as Oregano's. I have to admit though: they might be growing too fast, the service has been slow the last several visits, the food took along time and the pizza was soggy, but I still give them a 5 star review.

This pizza is very good and unique. The taste is great but there is a ton of grease or butter on the pie and in the crust (What doesn't taste good with butter?), The only reason I wouldn't give this 5 stars is the price but aside from that it is excellent pizza but very rich and not the kind that you would order for delivery too often - more of a treat.

Excellent wings and pizza. once slice is the size of most small or medium pizzas and the flavor is great. The wings are huge and look more like legs. I love the place and the service is fast and courteous.

Service was very good, steaks were OK comparable to Flemings and nothing near Mastro's. Side dishes limited and not very good and the lobster tail had absolutely no flavor - thought I was eating Orange Roughy. Everyone bragged about there being a swimming pool upstairs but it wasn't much more than a large wishing well. For the price I would stay with Mastro's.

Over-rated burger joint. How much can they put on a burger..or the real question is how much can they take out of your wallet and let you think that a hamburger was worth it. I had to eat outside and spent all my time shewing flies and the service was poor.
