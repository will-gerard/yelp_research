I was able to get an excellent rate through hotels.com. $58 a night. Yes the room is small. But there were no bed bugs! A woman that was going to the same convention stayed at an upscale hotel near by and had bite marks all over her arm. :P   I didn't get a chance to swim in the pool, but I checked it out and it was nice up there.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The bathrooms are small. For some reason I had to keep the hot water turned all the way off. Otherwise the water would be scorching HOT!  The cable needs to be upgraded to digital.  Didn't run into any ghosts. Thank goodness!

I stayed at the Hotel San Carlos and they are partnered with this gym. It's a block away from the hotel. Well equipt gym. I was able to have an excellent workout.

Beautiful, well maintained and a nice assortment of food in the food court. Tortilla was my favorite! :)

My boss is Indian and we decided to try and find a good Indian restaurant while in Az. We loved this place. We went back twice! Delicious food and wonderful service.  They have a facebook page with coupons.

Ordered the mushroom burger, they put canned mushrooms on the burger. Gross! The patty melt was good. But it's really hard to mess up a patty melt. My salad had a bug in it.  Service was nice. And they do have a yummy cider beer.

Reading the reviews below. Maybe you need to go to this restaurant with loud babies like I did. The service was prompt and attentive. I think they were trying to get us out of the restaurant as quickly as possible. We ordered about 5 different things, teriyaki chicken, tuna roll, california roll, king crab roll, soft shell crab appetizer, all delicious. But one. The soft shell crab. It was obviously over cook. The waitress tried to say it wasn't over cooked that it was a black pepper they sprinkle on the crab. But we sent it back and it came out properly the second time.   Really the servers look like there in college and just kind of huddle together waiting for the day to be over. It's a shame the service is so crappy. The food is very good.
