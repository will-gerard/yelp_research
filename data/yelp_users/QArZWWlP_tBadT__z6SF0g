I have always enjoyed The Keg, but generally go to the one at San Tan.  Last night was my Mom's birthday and we decided on going to The Keg at Chandler Mall.  I have never had a bad time at The Keg, but last night was horrible.  We ordered four steak dinners, salads, glasses of wine, beer, even dessert.  We were there to have a nice dinner and spend some money.  However, the service was completely horrible and unacceptable for the amount of money we were spending.  The salads came without bread, by the time they came by and asked if we wanted bread, we were already done with our salads and it had been over an hour since we sat down and we were ready for a meal since we were all hungry.  I waited quite a while for my IPA beer after finishing my Keg Size glass of wine and when I asked the waitress about the beer, she said, "Oh yeah, sorry, it has been sitting at the bar and I haven't had a chance to get it".  My Mom and I ordered our steaks medium well and they were completely red in the middle.  However, at this point, we didn't want to say anything because it had already been an hour and a half since we sat down.  My Mom wanted dessert, but didn't want to wait 30 minutes for it and so told the waitress nevermind.  The waitress replied that it would be out in 10 minutes tops.  Mom decided not to chance it and went home.  My son and I ordered desserts to go and they took over 20 minutes to arrive.  We thought since they were ordered "to go" that we would get our check and pay and leave, but it took another 20 minutes to flag down the waitress to get the check.  She seemed disinterested the entire time we were there, she rarely checked to see if we were OK or needed anything else and when we did need something else it took a very long time to arrive.  As a rule, I always tip 20% or more, but last night I had to leave 15% which was still quite a bit on a $170 bill, so the waitress still made out in spite of her crappy service.  I will need to stick with The Keg at San Tan going forward as I am very disappointed with the one at Chandler.

Great place to paint pottery or canvas any time, or register for many great classes in clay wheel throwing, glass fusing, scrapbooking and more.  Host your event or party in the great party room.

I want you to be great, so this review is intended to help.  I eat in Downtown Chandler every single day.  Your food is great, your service needs a little work..  I know you just opened so I will give you the benefit.    Just a bit more attentive on the service please.
