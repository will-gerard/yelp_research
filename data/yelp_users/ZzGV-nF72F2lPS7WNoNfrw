The Il Purista is onto of my favorite sandwiches in town.  Tons of mozzarella, a half inch thick pile of prosciutto and basil make for the quintessential Italian sandwich.  There are so many good things about De Falcos, if you care about food, you must go.

Four Peaks is the perfect restaurant.    The normal menu has the best bar food in the Phoenix area, but there are 3 lunch and three dinner specials daily, as well as Sunday brunch specials, that easily top any other restaurant in the same price range.  The spinach artichoke dip is a highly recommended bar bite.  It is creamy and cheesy and, despite the misleading name, full of both spinach and huge artichoke chunks.  It is paired with heaps off blue and red corn chips and soft, warm beer bread triangles.  It is perfect for sharing with friends.  Aside from being an excellent restaurant, Four Peaks also happens to be the best brewery in Arizona.  My favorite beer, Raj I.P.A, is super floral and hoppy, with only a slight bitter front end and a smooth, slightly malty finish.  It is the definition of balance and it has a gorgeous dark orange color too.  At 6.9 percent, it will also get you where ever you want to go.  For summer patio drinking, get Peachbru: half Sunbru, half Peach ale, and drink it fast while it is still cold.    From top to bottom, the service is always impeccable.  On the rare occasion that service slips, management always ensures that customers never leave unhappy.    Four Peaks is my favorite bar in the world.  If it is not yours, it is probably because you have not been yet.

Atmosphere: decor matches the style of food, and has a family kitchen feel to it.  Service: service is very quick and courteous.  Our waiter took care of keeping our drinks topped off, and made sure we had enough hot sauce, and garnishes for our pho.  Food: the pho is some of the best around.  The meat is fresh.  The broth is very flavorful, but not too salty.  There are plenty of noodles, and they are well cooked and have a lovely, somewhat firm texture.  The lemongrass chicken is bright and has a unique pleasant texture.  It also comes with a unique cracked rice that holds up well to the dish.  This is the only restaurant I've been to that serves this kind of rice.  I wish more places had it.  Spring rolls are solid, cheap and tasty.  The peanut sauce is a huge winner.

Friendly staff, mouthwatering gyro and baklava, and great prices in the restaurant and the attached middle-eastern market.

Good selection, but prices are generally a bit high on hard alcohol.  The growler fill ups are a great deal, though, and they often have random labels on special for steep discounts.    The staff is really nice, and seems to remember you from visit to visit.  They even keep my room mate's favorite beer in the cooler, when it's typically kept on the floor, which is really kind of them.

As a preface, this place has one of the best things i have ever eaten, the chibi mushroom slider, and the quality of the menu is first rate. I've been to Roka Akor 10+ times in the last few years, and I have never experienced service so bad.  After talking this place up to an out of town guest during the entire 15 minute drive over, we sat ourselves in the bar area, where the floor manager graciously assisted us with moving tables around for our party of three.  From that point on, we only interacted with the staff 3 times over the course of the next half hour: once to order our drinks, 25 minutes later when our drinks actually arrived, and immediately thereafter when I flagged down a passing waitress and handed her my credit card to close us out.  I'm not a particularly demanding man, but we visited at 9 o'clock on a Saturday night and it was not especially packed.  Other tables were receiving the usual solid service.  Meanwhile, my room mate and I were embarrassed in front of our guest.  Roka is good, but on principal I'll be steering clear of the Scottsdale location from here on.  Cheers!

La Bocca is a Mill Avenue establishment, and a restaurant I have patronized for years.  It is, without a doubt, the best place to eat at the bar in Tempe.  The bartendress, Bella, takes care of customers with a rare mix of knowledge, charm, and attention that will keep you coming back.    The food is consistently good to excellent, though it sometimes takes a little longer to come out when the place is packed.  Nonetheless, you are never left with an empty glass, and the comfortable appointments and relaxed atmosphere help to pass the time.    Sit at the bar.  Ask Bella for advice about what to drink.  Eat a pizza.  Tell me that does not sound like a nice evening out.

You are going to want to start with drinks (always).  The 13 and 14 are a whiskey lovers instant favorite.  The 13 is going to come off like a figgy Old Fashioned, and the 14 is a bit more unique, sweeter with rye as the primary spirit, but well-balanced nonetheless.  You cannot go wrong with either.  There is also a dangerous blue berry, vodka or gin heavy beverage that comes out cloudy white that you can drink all night.  For red wine go with a malbec, they have outstanding choices.  They also have some rare aged whiskies that are going to change based on availability, but ask if you are hurting for brown liquor on its own.  For white wine, you are on your own.  I don't go there.  On to food.  Do not deny yourself the fried cheese curds.  They come out crispy, melty, salty and sauceless, and so right.  They are really the essence of cheesiness.  They have a delicate flavor though, so you do not really need some overwhelming aioli mucking things up.  Next, try the baguette with roasted garlic and olive oil.  Simple logic here: fantastic ingredients perfectly executed.  They bring you a whole roasted garlic, sitting in a little pool of olive oil, and it spreads like butter on soft slightly toasted baguette.  Carbs, good oil, and bliss.  Your breath is going to be garlicky.  If you are on a date and your date is not into that, get a new date.  You are going to be distracted by the many main dish  offerings.  Get the gnocchi.  Growing up with an Italian grandmother, you learn to appreciate a good gnocchi when you taste one.  Camille would approve of Tuck Shop's super tender gnocchi clouds, airy on the inside, with slight crisp on the outside from the pan frying treatment.  They come in a cheesy sauce, which is strong on the parmigiano, and thick and creamy.  I cannot remember the last time I had gnocchi this good.  Highly recommended.  My mom loves gnocchi, so I know where I'm taking her for mother's day.  Finally, get the Lobstah Mac and Cheese.  Warning long winded preface incoming.  I am not a mac and cheese guy.  So often it is just sludgy cheese sauce and overcooked slimy noodles.  Adding lobster on your average mac and cheese (or mashed potatos while we are on the subject) is like putting a big block V-8 into a wrecked Ford Pinto; you are taking something great, and putting it into an unmitigated mess.  Lobster mac and cheese in general is more idea than food.  It always sounds better than it is.  It occupies the imagination as dare-not decadent; the kind of showy food that a gold miner would order for his hookers after hitting the mother lode; the kind of thing Camille, who survived the Great Depression, would be ashamed of me for ordering, wasting good money ; the combination of the comdortable and familiar and unexperienced luxary: the embodiment of the American Dream, and just as elusive: classic Americana that's grown-up, sexed-up, and classed-up with little something extra, a little something rare, a little something different.  I went to those lengths to talk about everything Tuck Shop's Lobstah Mac and Cheese is not.  It is fucking great.  I added with lobster (obviously) and got the bacon on the side (for maximum crispness).  The pasta was al dente, the cheese sauce was rich and creamy, without being overly decadent, the baked topping is a pleasant textural contrast with a subtle crunch.  The lobster was cooked right, and did not get lost in what is usually an overwhelming setting.  The name of the game here is balance.  It is everything the Tuck Shop represents.  In closing, Tuck Shop is a place every 20 or 30 something who grew up in Arizona needs to experience.  Aside from the killer food, drinks, and service, Tuck Shop more importantly reflects the latest example of the cultural renaissance Phoenix is experiencing.  The children of Arizona, like Grace Unger, are staying or returning home with the dream of transforming our sleepy desert town into a racuous food, drink, and entertainment capital with its own saguaro laced flavor.  It is a thriving business that sprouted out of the once ailing Coronado neighborhood, which is helmed by a young female entrepreneur who takes your dining experience personally.  Grace wants you to be happy.  She wants to get to know everyone who walks in her door.  She, like Tuck Shop, is instantly familiar, fun, and Classed-Up Classic.  I hope you love it here as much as I do.  See you at the bar!

Tour de Tavern is a great time for the whole family!  The TdT Crew will customise your tour to your tastes, but expect a few favorite Old Town dive bars along the way.  Arrive early and have a pretzel at Brat Haus.  They are the best around!

I had a horrific experience at this restaurant.    I went with several friends during happy hour on a Friday and we were seated quickly which was a plus.  The acoustics are very poor due to the open floor plan.  It is pure cacophony.  Expect to yell over each other.  This was a this was the first of many minuses.   Upon being seated it took the staff 10 minutes to bring us water.  It was another 10 minutes before we had first contact with our server.  We said we were not ready and asked for a beer list that we never recieved.  It was another 10 minutes until someone took our drink and food order.  It took another 15 minutes before the drinks came.  I am not exaggerating about the wait, I checked my watch.  This place primarily pours beers, so the bar back-up is hard to justify.   When the drinks finally came, our server spilled a full pint on me.  She apologized profusely.  I was not mad at her, but I was upset with the experience in general.  I actually felt bad for her because it was pretty clear that she was not getting any support from the rest of the staff.  Despite my tables location directly in front of the hostess stand and the obvious disruption caused by the spill, our table was never contacted by a manager.  Our table paid full price for everything, if you were wondering.   The food was mediocre.  The gravy fries were on point.  The fries were crispy and hot.  The gravy was pretty flavorful and had tons of bacon in it.  There was only a hint of the promised cheese curds, which would have made everything better.  However, if i ever come back, I will get the gravy on the side, because the fries got soggy fast.  The wings were large, moist and properly cooked, and they came out with the sauce on the side.  The wings appeared unseasoned.  The sauce was extremely basic; essentially thick tobasco.  Overall, the wings were unremarkable.  The pizza English muffins were unflavorful and had a mushy texture.     Unfortunately, the whole experience lacked warmth.  I would have spoken to the manager about our awful experience, but after the spill  I was focused on leaving as quickly as possible.  I am lucky my phone is waterproof and I really hope the sticky mess cleans off my wallet!  On the upside, the bathrooms and the restaurant generally were clean and pretty well kept.
