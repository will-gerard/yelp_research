I always pass this place driving to school but never had the time to try it out. I was excited to try it today with a group of people after church. I really wanted to like it, but overall, it was a bad experience. The food took an hour to get out, the interior design is old and non-welcoming, and the cook (i'm guessing is the owner) came out to greet us with bed hair. The food was mediocre, I ordered the pad thai spicy. Sorry, I wont be dining here again.

Walked in and asked for the flowers and type of design I wanted. Walked out in less than 20 minutes with a beautiful arrangement! I didn't think I could get it done so quickly. Family owned and very nice.

I haven't had better pho anywhere in az. the large pho is enormous for the price. i usually go with my family and order a regular sized pho for myself and a number 45 (beef/rice plate) to share with another person. the one down side of this place is that it's located in a little more run down area and the restaurant's cleanliness isn't that great. nonetheless, their food makes up for it. i would definitely recommend this place.

Little Saigon is the best vietnamese food you can get in Glendale. Good, cozy atmosphere too. But watch out on Sundays, they close a little early; make sure you get your order in by 6:30pm!

Takamatsu is probably the best Korean restaurant in Glendale. Still not the greatest, but better than its competition in the city.

Good but not the best pho. Their boba, however, is the best i've had in glendale. Good service and cleaner than most vietnamese restaurants i've been to.
