The food is very dry and the place is super dirty. Would not recommend. Never been to the one on Central Ave so cant speak to that one.

This place is great. Need a few things done to my bike and they are able to take care of it that day. Prices seemed reasonable. I didn't ck other places but the service was great so if it was high I didn't mind

What a dump this place is. Course feels and looks terrible. Service is poor and food quality is bad.

Service was ok but the food was just terrible. I remember Applebees being consistently good. Maybe it's just this location

I really can't say enough about this place. Food is fantastic and the service is spot on. I have been to a couple of the locations. Surprise and in Glendale.  Both are great. You have to try the 3 cheese mac and cheese

Had such a good time. Played 18 with a friend and if you go after 2pm the prices drop. Course is fairly easy and nice an open. Bar is cool and the staff are friendly. Oh and the food was excellent.

This has got to the laziest car wash I have ever gone to. Even after bring my car back it still isn't clean. I would NOT recommend this place. Would be better just to wash your car at home.

These meatball subs and the gold wings are fantastic. I'm so happy this place is here. My wife always gets one of the salads and they always use fresh ingredients. The service is super personable and seem to get along with everyone. I very much would highly recommend. Oh and they deliver. BAM i'm sold

What a find. The rolls were excellent and the service was over the top. The place is a bit small but very clean. The staff was friendly and came over to talk with us. We had our 11mo with us and she was all the rave. Highly recommend, we'll be back soon.

Prime rib and mushrooms are very good. We got our food to go. The service we did get was friendly and respectful. We will defiantly return and maybe eat there next time.

What a wonderful place. The food and service were both outstanding. Very friendly atmosphere. We'll definitely be back. I had the meat ball sandwich and my wife had a strawberry salad. Oh and we also had the tomato bruschetta. Wow everything was just right. See you soon

So my wife and 15 mo old daughter went for the first time 11/22. I wasn't really sure how much I was going to like it. But gave it a shot anyways. This place blew us away. We had snow crab legs. shrimp and mussels. All were fantastic. Steve our server was very helpful. Also, if they say it's going to be hot and messy, trust them.  I think we met the owner as well. I just had a mouthful of food everytime she came around. Genuinely nice people. Would very much recommend this place.
