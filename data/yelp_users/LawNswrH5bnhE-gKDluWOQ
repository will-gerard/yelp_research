New owners make it a whole new ball game at what used to be Lollicup to now "Yes Cafe"; Amazing hot boba. Recommend trying it if you haven't before!

Fair price, great overall quality regardless of what you order, and a dependable boba spot in AZ. Take your friends if they are new to Boba; the staff are very helpful!

Do not come here for the boba. Period. Not only were they hardened in the middle (sure tale sign of old, poorly made boba) and expensive but the women who worked they didn't seem to understand how they can be eaten.  When I asked her if I could have my boba in a hot drink she laughed, then told me that was "impossible" because they would melt. The tea was good I will say, but don't waste your time or hopes on the boba.

If you're desperate for boba then have at it, but otherwise I would try a legitimate boba spot.

A solid hole-in-the wall pizza place. They make their own sauce every day! If you want no frills, tasty greasy pizza come here.
