Love living here. It's at the heart of town, super convenient to great restaurants and bars. The community itself is really friendly. The units have all been upgraded and look great. Everyone that comes to visit is always complimenting the area and the way things look. I recommend taking a look if you're looking for a comfortable but urban style of living.

Horrible customer service. We just moved to the area and this would have been a great location for us to use as a dry cleaner so I was excited to try it out. First time we took our clothes in they damaged a new sweater beyond repair and then it took forever to get a hold of a manager. After several calls got the information to the owner who never contacted me or returned an email. Still no compensation or anything offered. Will never return! Would have given no stars if possible .
