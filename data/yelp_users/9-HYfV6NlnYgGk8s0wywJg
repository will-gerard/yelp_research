I always enjoy going to the JW Marriott Desert Ridge so we decided to stop by the hotel and have a drink by the fire after dinner.  We found a spot outside Roy's patio area.  Their outside firepit area gets a "5 star" but it's hard to give the staff that waited on us any type of compliment.  We waited at least 10 minutes before anyone even noticed us and there were plenty of servers outside.  Our group had to flag a waiter down to wait on us only to tell us, "he would find someone".  After another 5 minutes we had to just about "beg" someone to take our drink order.  When the waiter finally took our order he acted like he was doing us a favor.  The cosmos were good but servicde is something to be desired.

Another trip to Arizona and another trip to Roy's. Certainly a different experience than I had the last time. Friends were talking about the "Aloha Happy Hour" from 4 to 6 pm so we stopped by. Their outside patio is probably one of the nicest spots in town.   Everything on the happy hour appetizer menu is $5 and trust me my party tried them all. They also have a special 'cocktail" menu (everything is $5) if you are looking to expand beyond wine and beer.   Happy hour can include anything from crispy lobster potstickers, lobster spring rolls to mini burgers or tenderloin tips. All delicious and certainly enough to fill even a hearty appetite. Our server "Rebecca" was not only very attentive but also very knowledgeable and helpful in making our menu and drink selections.   A sure "winner" and probably one of the best deals in town.

After hiking Camelback we were looking for a breakfast spot near by. It was an easy pic to go with this place. It was really crowded unlike other places nearby that serve breakfast/brunch.   The menu offers a great variety of items to choose from. I went with something simple and ordered 2 eggs (scrambled), bacon, toast and added hash browns for a slight up charge (7.35). I thought the hash browns were especially tasty and the bacon was crispy just as I had requested. My hubby ordered the breakfast burrito (13) with the extra sauce which they call "monster style". Please split this with someone and you will be much happier. It's a very large portion.   The atmosphere here is trendy and I like the openness of the restaurant. There's different seating options which is nice although most of the outside seating is right on Scottsdale road. We sat around the counter which I found enjoyable. Prices are reasonable and the service was good. Just don't expect anything fancy here. This is a cute casual breakfast joint.

I really like this place.  The food is outstanding.  Reasonable but really good.  I ordered the parmesan crusted chicken and it was delicious. For $12 dollars it's a lot of food.  Came with a small salad, pasta and two 6 ounce chicken breasts.  I would certainly order this again.  If you like baked potatoes this is also the place for you. They know how to make them here.  I like crunchy shells on the outside of my baked potato and that's just how they make them. It's not a fancy place but has a cute bar area and food has consistently been good every time I go there.  Con: seating available outside but it overlooks the parking lot.

When we were passing through town we stopped at The Horny Toad for lunch. I have to say my experience was just "ok".  The chicken noodle soup lacked any substance.  My girlfriend had the chile and commented that said "shes had better".  We sat outside on the picnic tables which is a cute spot but certaily nothing special.  I doubt I would make a special trip to town just to go to this place.  Server however was expeptional and staff very friendly.

If you're headed to Scottsdale and looking to play some golf make a trip out to Quintero Golf and Country Club. This course is a little ways off the beaten track but it will be an experience you'll remember. (Temporary clubhouse only).   This course is semi-private and if you're not a member you need to buy a "Troon card" to be able to make a tee time. Worth every penny though because it is rated in the"top 100" courses in America and truly a remarkable golf experience.

This place seems to be a local favorite. It's tucked away in a strip mall and about a 15 minute taxi ride down the strip. My husband and I were intrigued try this place out and we quickly became "Rosemary" fans.   They have a nice bar area as you first walk in with high top seating options. We sat here before our table was ready and we were lucky enough to catch happy hour (which goes till 7). The restaurant has 2 different rooms for seating (both connected though a doorway). Depending upon your mood you may want to make a request as to which one you prefer. The dining area with the kitchen in it is definitely quite a bit noisier.   The evening we went I somehow had a craving for pork. When our waiter told me that their "12 oz. double cut grilled pork chop" was his favorite I couldn't resist. It's the only item on the menu that has been consistently on the menu (since the restaurant opened 12 years ago.)  Even after I had the last bite I was still craving it.  My husband ordered the risotto starter and Tasso crusted salmon. Both were delicious.   Entrees are pricey here ($37 range). They also offer a chef tasting menu ($80) and a fixed prix menu ($55).   Service overall here was exceptonal until the very end. Once we received dessert the waiter neglected to clear our dishes. Despite that lack of attention still a good experience.

Certainly worth a visit if you're in town. This outlet houses a lot of designer stores and other favorites. I got here close to opening and it was already crowded.   Well laid out mall and if you need to grab some lunch there is a fairly large food court with in and outdoor seating. (One sit down restaurant too).   Stores were offering deep discounts the day I went. At the end of your shopping experience it would be surprising if you didn't come home with a few bargains in your bag.

The first time I walked into the JW Marriott I was "wowed" and I still feel the same way. Rooms are nice but I think it's the overall experience here that really sets this place apart from other hotels. As you approach the entrance you will quickly get the feeling that you've come to a "luxury" destination and staff here always know how to treat their guests.   The inside of the hotel leads to luscious flowers and water falls. As you travel down the stairs to the lover level you can cozy up in their Vista lounge. Lots of seating options both inside and outside. If the weather is a little chilly my favorite spot here is around one of their many fire pits. If you're hungry try their happy hour from (3 to 6 pm) for drinks or sushi rolls.   Their list of amenities is endless. The JW has their own fitness center, spa, offer 2 golf courses (Wildfire), and have a beautiful outdoor pool including a lazy river (and slide for the kids).   I would certainly give this hotel 5 stars but the only thing I feel Marriott is lacking on here is the quality of the restaurants. I have never been overwhelmed with either Blue Sage (casual) or their higher end Italian restaurant (Tuscany).

If you are a serious hiker looking for a challenge then Camelback is for you. This is not an easy hike. There are 2 trail options and based on the recommendations we went with what is supposed to be the easier of the two, the Cholla trail.   Hike early in the morning if you are can. Not only will it be cooler but finding a parking spot will be easier. Parking can be difficult as there is not a parking lot at the trailhead and it is "street parking" along Invergordon Road (aka 64th St). The Cholla trailhead is in a very residential area and there is also not a bathroom available so plan accordingly.   It really is an amazing trail but come prepared. Bring some water and hiking boots would be strongly recommended. You will literally be climbing up and down rocks along the trail. My daughter suggested gloves and I thought she was crazy but she was right. I could have used a pair along the trail.  The first 1.1 miles of the trail is mostly just hiking with a shorter rock climbs but when you reach the "helicopter pad" or "saddle" be ready for more. A women along the trail said to me "now that was the easy part, this is the hard part"! The final 1/3 mile is the most intense which requires climbing straight up to the peak. For all your efforts you'll be rewarded with some fantastic views!

It's easy to say that Parasol Down has to be pretty close to what I call "paradise". This outdoor seating area (in the lower level of the Wynn) overlooks an amazing water feature and is surrounded by a forest of trees. Somehow it's hard to believe the busy strip is just outside these doors.   I would HIGHLY recommend stopping here and trying one of their unique drinks on the cocktail menu (no food is offered on the menu here). It's the "perfect spot" to relax and enjoy the view.

I would be happy to return to the Renaissance Las Vegas Hotel on another visit to town. If you prefer to stay a little off the strip this hotel would be a perfect spot for you. It's also right off the monorail and just a $10 cab ride to Caesar's Palace.    It has great access to the convention center.  It's also ideal for the business traveler as it has a business lounge and additional meeting rooms available for use. The staff here is over and beyond friendly and willing to accommodate their guests. Rooms are nicely appointed and they have a large work out facility.  My only complaint here is the pool area. It's what I call a "make believe" pool that gets very little sun. They also have only one restaurant and if you're staying at the hotel for awhile it would be nice to have a few more options but.....then again the strip is always nearby.

I have driven by this place many times when I am in Phoenix but finally decided to try it last year.  Now I frequent this place every time I am in town.  Their cobb salad (house speciality) is a must to try. It's "to die for".  Proportions are large so you can easily split some entrees.  The glazed carrots are VERY sweet and filling. My husband said they were a disappontment last night but the crab cakes were "tasty". Con: can sometimes get noisy in the resturant.

In AZ for the week and had some friends come to visit. First place we took them for dinner was, "White Chocolate Grill". Sat outside in the patio area where it is a lot easier to talk than in the main restaurant.  Since it's mid-November it was a little chilly but with the heaters on it was not a problem.  My girlfriend had the blackened fish sandwich which she said was "outstanding". Also tried the grilled salmon and Cajun chicken sandwich which were both "excellent" choices. Waiter was very attentive and service was "unbeatable".

My experience at Hotel Valley Ho was exceptional. I didn't stay overnight here but attended my niece's wedding. This hotel has been remodeled and is retro chic. Think "Frank Sinatra" era. The location is great as its centrally located in downtown Scottsdale. It's just a short walk from shops and restaurants in Old Town too.   This wedding took place late February and after the ceremony the celebration started on the rooftop at Hotel Valley Ho. I wasn't sure what to expect but I have to say I was impressed with the set up. It was sunny and warm so there were umbrellas set up for shade and some casual seating (couches and small round tables and chairs) with 2 bars on either end. Simply lovely! With the hotel having 7 floors the views are quit incredible from the top.   The remainder of the reception and dinner was held in their ballroom. But don't think typical ballroom here. The dinner and dancing area is covered but there are large glass doors that open up to the outside to another bar area. The food was delicious and perfectly prepared (for 150 people). Staff were attentive and this facility seemed like an excellent choice for the occasion.

I continue to be disappointed with the quality of the merchandise at BR Outlet. You can occasionally find some items here that work but that seems to be the exception not the rule.  I wasn't too impressed with the inside of the store either. The dressing room area is too small and there can often times be a long wait. There were also a limited amount of sales associates on the floor to help with sizes.   Come on BR....show us some improved style here.

I couldn't wait to stop by Zara when I was in town but what a disappointment for me. First of all the clerks need a lesson in customer service. Not ONCE did anyone offer to help me as I browsed around the store multiple times.    Can't say I was all that impressed with the merchandise either. Maybe I just caught this place on a bad day but I sure won't hurry back to go shopping here anytime soon.

We decided to stop in here for a pre-show dinner. This place is easy to get to off the strip since it's on the street level of The Forum Shops near Caesar's Palace. We arrived without a reservation and got seated right away.   The seafood chopped salad was exceptionally good. The ingredients were fresh and we were able to get in and out quickly. Not really knowing where we were going to eat on the strip this place turned out to be far better than expected.

This place in located on the first floor of the Renaissance LV Hotel. I have to say I wasn't too impressed with this place at first but after I made a few visits my feelings changed quickly.   Why I like this place.....   The bartenders are personable. They pour good drinks and the prices are reasonable. Another great thing about this place is if you order any bar food it comes from the same kitchen as their restaurant (which gets good ratings). They have several large screen TV's so you can catch a sporting event if that's what you're interested in. There are a variety of seating options too but I prefer sitting at the bar here.   What I don't like about this place....   It sure doesn't specialize in ambiance. It's a perfectly fine hotel bar but it's far from what I would call "intimate". Outside seating is an option but it overlooks Paradise Road which is a busy street.   All in all a perfectly great place to have a cocktail and enjoy a appetizer.

When our server "Josh" came over to our table to explain all the options on the menu he only made our dinner selection more difficult. The fire roasted shrimp sounded amazing and it was.  Presentation was exceptional and as Josh described it, "you really don't even know where to start taking the first bite".   Like most of the other steakhouses in Vegas the entrees come with a price tag but quality and service are both exceptional. Ambiance could use a few steps up but overall this place has some great options on the menu and doubt you'll be disappointed here.

If you're feeling like "Mexican" this place is just ok. Yes just ok. Their homemade taco chips are definitely a winner and hard to put down. Salsa "tasty".   I like the 2 or 3 combo option on the menu. Lots of items to choose from. I tried the shredded chicken and beef tacos (served with rice and refried beans). Shells were homemade but a little greasy. My husband went with the shrimp enchiladas ($13.99). Nothing special and expensive.   The have a long list of margaritas including their "Kick-Ass Tex-Ass" topped with a shot of beer. During happy hour (3 to 6:30) most margaritas are $5.99. Although that may seem like a good deal don't be fooled because the glass is filled to the brim with ice.   Overall kind of pricey for a Mexican restaurant and not all that impressed with the quality of the food. Let's take it up a notch here.

I LOVE this place.  This really is one of my favorite spots for dinner in Kierland.  The food is always reliable and every entree I have ever had has always been good. My husband and I both had the baked ziti.  Very flavorful and delicious pasta dish.  They do a great job with presentation and staff is always very attentive.  I prefer the outside seating in the restaurant. Defintely gets an "A plus" in my book.

Of all the hiking trails in Scottsdale I still prefer Pinnacle Peak. I could hike this trail day in and day out and never get tired of it. The trails are meticulously groomed and for the most part smooth (unlike Camelback which has a lot more rugged rock).   A leisure hike here takes about 1 hour 20 minutes. It's a decent workout too but just know that it's a loop trail. You hike in and turn around and hike out on the same trail. The trail length is about 1 3/4 miles one way. I try to stay hydrated before the hike and don't take any water with me but may do.  If you plan to hike Pinnacle Peak there are a few things you may want to know.  - It's essentially open dawn to dusk (6:45-6:30pm). Hours do vary slightly. - No dogs or bicycles are allowed in the park.  - Smoking is not allowed in the park either.  - I'd suggest doing the hike in morning to avoid the hot sun in the afternoon. If you decide to go later in the day make sure you're at the trailhead at closing as they do lock the gate.  - Rock climbing is allowed in designated areas and also horseback riding (for expert equestrians only) but of the many times I've been here I've never seen either.  -Just so you know there are restrooms at the start of the trailhead (which is not the case at Camelback).   Overall Pinnacle Peak is a wonderful hike with some great views. So get off your butt and go experience it yourself! You won't regret it!

I love Kona Grill back home so hubby and I decided to stop by this location when we were in town. Located in "City North" this place is a perfect meeting place for any size group. The outside patio area is lovely and they have an expanded patio area for larger groups too. Their happy hour on the bar side goes from 3-7pm most weekdays with a late night happy hour for you night owls. They have now added their "all day" Sunday happy hour so don't miss out on that! You can leave feeling satisfied after choosing from a variety of their apps. My favorite is the sweet and sour shrimp. Pair that with a small salad and you'll be coming back for more. They have an endless list of delicious sushi rolls to choose from too. I prefer happy hour over dinner. You'll get a lot of food at a reasonable price.   I am particularly attracted to their bar/outside seating area. I prefer it for a casual gathering and it tends to be a lot quieter than sitting inside. The bar area is positioned so even if you are sitting on the inside of the restaurant (at the bar) you get the feeling like you're still sitting outside.  Our server was attentive, knowledgeable and very friendly. This place is a sure "winner" next time you're near by.

Maybe I'm just obsessed with this place because there isn't one near me. This was my main reason for going to the Premium Outlets - North and trust me...I  wasn't disappointed.   Staff here were extremely helpful and friendly. Also feel the quality of their merchandise equally compares to their regular store.   Huge savings the day I came with 40 to 50 percent off already discounted items. Scan the store well because they have a LOT of merchandise for both men and women. JCrew outlet....are you ever going to make your way to Minneapolis?

Have been to Pita Jungle twice before. Feel the wait staff do a good job. Always friendly and good service. Best hummus in town. For s dollar more get the bigger plate of hummus but ask for extra pitas (39 cents each) and some extra cucumbers and tomatoes (99 cents). Not a fancy place but certainly someplace you want to try out.

Renting a car can sometimes be expensive at Sky Harbor airport. The cars are also offsite so you have to take a shuttle to your assigned vendor. I've gotten used to the routine but after we started comparing prices we've opted to rent a car offsite. We choose another Enterprise location that was between where we were staying and the airport. That's how we decided on this location.   On a recent trip we looked at rates at the airport ($1100) and offsite at this location ($550). Both for a standard car. With the savings it was an easy decision to decide to rent at this spot.The staff here greeted us with a smile and were more than accommodating. They offered us a free upgrade from our standard size vehicle to a small SUV! When you return the vehicle you can either bring it back to the same location (no charge) or drop it off at the airport for an additional fee ($50).   Moral of the story: Compare rates first and if you find that you will be saving a lot consider renting a car offsite. It truly is worth it!

Truth is "my new favorite spot" in Scottsdale. I mean it's kind of difficult not to like a place with great food and a fun atmosphere. The outdoor seating area overlooks the courtyard area at Kierland.   I think "Bar North" gets a little overlooked. It's like playing Annie, Annie over. You've got North (the restaurant), kitchen in the middle and Bar North on the other side. Menu is exactly the same at either place. Just a more casual, comfortable environment at Bar North. It's also quieter and there are lots of cozy seating options if you just want to stop for a cocktail. I have to say I prefer "Bar North" over the restaurant "North".    If you make a visit try their chitarra pasta dish. It's served with grilled butternut squash, brussel sprouts and hazelnuts. Served with a light butter cream sauce. I know kind of an odd combo but one of the "best" pasta dishes I've ever had.   They do "special requests" too. My husband always asks for their chicken lasagna. Not the typical lasagna version your thinking of but it's been one of North's specialties and no longer listed on the menu. If you're hungry for pizza try their prosciutto fig goat cheese pizza. Another "unique" winner.  I LOVE this place and can't wait to go back. Bar North next time I'm in town I'm a coming.

Looking for the perfect thin crust pizza? Well if you like homemade mozzarella then try out Upper Crust Pizza and Wine Bar. Our friends introduced us to this restaurant on a recent visit to Scottsdale. This restaurant is situated in a strip mall and doesn't look like anything special from the outside but take a step inside and you'll feel differently. It has that "cozy" feeling that makes you want to keep coming back.  They make a variety of homemade pizzas to order that come out of the oven with just the right amount of "crispness".  On my short trip to Scottsdale I made 2 visits to Upper Crust. (We just liked it so much the first time I couldn't wait to go back). In addition to pizza they feature calzone and pasta on the menu. It's a casual place that's big on "atmosphere". On both visits we were lucky enough to have "Laura" wait on us. She was personable and made our experience very enjoyable.   Pizza sizes tend to be larger than what you would expect. The "personal size" pizza was plenty to eat for my party of 2. If you're a wine lover my tip would be to make a visit on a Wednesday night.  All bottles of wine are half off!

I wasn't sure what O.H.S.O. (Outrageous Homebrewer's Social Outpost) stood for or what to expect but what I do know is that I can't wait to come back! You don't find me at a brewery pub very often as I'm not a huge beer lover but the fam was on vacation and the kids couldn't wait to try out a local brewery hot spot. O.H.S.O. was the perfect lunch spot on the way from the airport to our hotel.   If I had to base my review on first impressions I wouldn't give this place many stars. Just driving by it doesn't look like much other than a building with a few orange awnings. It's a good thing we listened to Sara W. who kept reinforcing their backyard and patio area. She was right! On a Thursday over the lunch hour that's where everyone was. The outside patio area is surrounded with large booths and ample seating. Simply lovely and a fun vibe.   There are 40 plus brews on taps but since this is a brew pub there's wine and other cocktails available too. I have to say our food was delicious and the service exceptional. If you're a guacamole fan you do need to order that as a starter. Bits of corn and dried cherries in there. Trust me it's incredible!

If you're golf passionate like me then I think you might want to consider a trip to the PING fitting center, located near their factory in Phoenix. The best part about this fitting is it's free! The doors to the fitting center open at 7:30 am. Arriving early is good advice. We got here about an hour before opening and probably wouldn't have needed to get there quite that early but they have a limited numbers of bays so depending upon where you are in line your wait could be up to 2 hours. If you decide to come in the afternoon (wouldn't recommend it) keep in mind their doors close at 4:30pm and if you don't get called by 3pm you may not be able to be seen that day.  The fitters at PING are all well trained and provide you with a thorough fitting. Their proprietary software is effective at determining exact specifications. This is a tremendous value compared to some of the other fitters (like Hot Stix Golf). Granted (with Hot Stix) you are able to hit outside but they charge $250 for a basic fitting (for an entire set of clubs). Of course PING's goal is to get you to buy new clubs but there is no obligation here and it's always great knowing that any new clubs you buy are properly fitted.

On a recent visit to Phoenix we were headed down Scottsdale Road looking for a place to eat. We decided on Il Bosco. Fellow Yelpers never let me down and they were giving this place 5 stars so I decided we needed to try it ourselves.   We were greeted by Bill, (golf professional) and now owner of Il Bosco. Inside the restaurant is tiny but charming. The menu includes starters, salads and pizza but before ordering check out the "special board" that hangs from the ceiling. We finally decided on the Biagga. It came topped with prosciutto, fig jam and goat cheese. It was incredibly tasty and the perfect combination of ingredients.   What makes this place special is the personal touch of the staff and the quality of the food. They are there to make sure you have a good experience. After only one visit I'm hooked! Some of the best brick oven pizza I've had and I can't wait to go back!

It's not often I give a restaurant 5 stars but Rusconi's American Kitchen earned one. Recommended by some friends we decided to have dinner here on our last night in town. Clearly don't get swayed by the store front of the building or the fact that it's in a strip mall and next door to a sandwich shop. Once you step inside the door you'll be pleasantly surprised and understand what I'm talking about.   The inside of the restaurant has a warm feeling and the smell of wood fire and delicious food will quickly overwhelm you. The acoustics are perfect too. A little noise but not too much and you can easily carry on a conversation.  Our group decided on a variety of items on the menu. We started with the Artisan cheese. A generous assortment of meats, cheese, olives and roasted peppers. It was accompanied with grilled crostini. For entrees I just couldn't resist their version of a meatless lasagna. It's nothing like what you might expect. It's a tasty dish with a variety of veggies along with a few sheets of homemade pasta. It was delicious and something I could eat every night!  My hubby ordered the roasted salmon. The glaze was sweet and the "mixture of tastes and textures was an amazing combination". Others tried the mushroom soup and commented, "the best they'd ever had". The seared scallops were "incredible" and served on top of a bed of cauliflower puree. Service was exceptional and each one of our dishes was prepared perfectly.  This place is a gem. Certainly a winner in every category for me.

When my daughter came to town with her boyfriend it was mandatory we hit a few breweries. This one came "highly recommend". We arrived later on a Sunday night so seating wasn't an issue and decided to start in the tap room and sit at the bar.   As I might of mentioned before I don't really drink much beer but the staff were so friendly and and genuinely nice that it was difficult to resist the free samples they kept giving us to try. The bartender told me "we'll keep having you try some until you find something you like"!!  Yes! It's a wild combo but get the duck fat fries with pulled pork and beer cheese. It's a perfect starter to share. We also had the green chili pork sliders and cheeseburger. All the food was really good with plenty to eat. There are daily specials each night too so be sure to check these out.   This place is a about a 30 minute drive out of the Scottsdale area and well worth it. They've got a great selection of beers and staff went out of there way to make us happy. The live music on the outside patio was a nice touch too.
