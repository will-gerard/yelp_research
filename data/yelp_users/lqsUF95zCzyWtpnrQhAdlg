I just wanted to send a quick thank you to Jorge from the McDowell location! From the moment he took our call, he was informative and friendly. He placed the battery we needed on hold and provided a quote that was better priced than the other places we had called. When we got there he was quick an efficient and had us out the door in less than 20 minutes. He got what started as a bad day, back on track!

The food was delicious as always, but what was even more amazing was DOUG! Saying he was "knowledgeable" and "friendly" would be understatements. He knew the menu and ingredients like the back of his hand, and was able to recommend some great stuff. Not only did he know his shit, but he anticipated our needs and made sure we had everything we needed and more before we ever had to ask. Our bellies were full from the wonderful food, wallets in check because of the amazing prices, and service was on point. Thanks Doug! We'll see you all again soon.

Authentic and delicious. Service was great, atmosphere even better, and most of all the food was awesome. Had the chicken piccata, i love that you can get a side of pasta or grilled veggies. The veggies were actually really well seasoned as was the chicken, sometimes other restaurants go overboard with the lemon, but this was perfectly seasoned and the chicken was tender and juicy. Also had the meatballs and you could really taste the flavors as well and everything was just so fresh. Lastly, Jake (the owner) suggested a delicious glass of red Rosso from the wine menu and it was the perfect compliment to the meal. Thanks again!

**Updating this review, since Dana (the owner was VERY quick to respond and went above and beyond to rectify the situation and assure me that he takes feedback seriously and handles it with grace and kindness **   I'm not sure who our server was (since he didn't introduce himself, nor did any of us want to ask) but the service last night was  really disappointing. We had a large party (15) and we called in advance (two days prior) to make a reservation. This was a going away party for a close friend, that turned in to the entire table feeling as if we were walking on egg shells because server was so condescending and rude to us. It ruined the experience for us. He told us from the time we sat down that he would be assigning seat numbers in order to make it easier to create separate checks. He asked that we "not move" or that he would have to spend "a long time figuring it all out". The only thing was, that we were still waiting on two others to join, and we even told him that they were running late but that we would all like to order drinks. It took another 15 mins or so so flag him down, because he only took the drink order for the person on the end and walked away. After ordering our first round, our additional two guests arrived and sat toward the middle of the table (I think they should be able to sit where they'd like ) but the server huffed and made us all feel really badly for "messing up his system". When he finally got around to taking orders, he got to the two in the middle and asked to take their order while he was flipping through his sheets of paper with disdain. The person whose order he was taking felt bad and innocently asked if it would be easier if we gave him our names. He very quickly snapped back at her, "I'm tired, you all moved around. It's fine... I'll figure it out" then furiously shuffled more paper. This was the tone, and the attitude he had with us for the remainder of our meal. He made us feel as if we were burdening him the entire time. I work in hospitality, and I believe that when service is great it should be recognized. On the flip side, this server could've really done a better job at making us feel welcome. Instead, we were all hesitant to ask for things knowing he would make some sarcastic remark, or give us an uneasy feeling. There were other small things, him leaning in on the back of our chairs, not bringing us all water even after we requested some, and asking us to stack our dishes and pass them to him (which, i would get if they were in hard-to-reach places, but they were not). I get that people have bad days, and it's a bummer that he was tired, but he could've made a small easy effort to ensure that things went more smoothly than they did. It's much easier to throw on a smile than let your bad energy trickle down to everyone else. I also frequent Hulas Downtown, and as always, the food and drinks were great.

I took a very nice Michael Kors blouse in May. I asked the person who was working at the time if the gold chain around the collar of the shirt would need to be removed. She replied, "no." So I trusted that my blouse would be cleaned and returned as it was when I brought it in. Much to my dismay, when I returned for the shirt, the chain was missing, and I was told I would get a "call back" after they had searched for it. Patiently I waited for over a week, and then stopped back to in to see if they had found it. Again, no one knew what I was speaking about and the chain had not been located.  Another week went by, and again I had to stop in because I never received a call as a follow up. I was told that they couldn't see what the chain looked like from the camera footage and that they now had to "check the other stores". This seemed like a way of putting me off for a bit longer, but again, I waited for a promised call that never came. Finally I decided to write the owner an email explaining the situation. Initially, his response was fairly quick and he promised a resolution from his store manager as he would be going on an extended vacation. Again, I never heard from her or him again and I had to follow up for a 4th time.  He was quick to apologize, but also didn't take ownership of the situation by telling me that they "normally are not responsible for articles not attached to the clothing" This annoyed me even more since 1. It was attached, and 2. I specifically asked his store attendant about it. Had she told me they would remove it, I would NOT have dry cleaned it. So now it's my fault? Ridiculous.  He also offered to compensate me for my blouse if I could bring in a receipt. Not only did I have to waste my time searching for the shirt, but it was no longer available online or in store. When I sent him a picture with a link to show him it was unavailable again I got a response blaming me for the loss because it wasn't attached to the shirt. The shirt was priced at $99 originally. He offered me $40 OR some "store credit"  In my last and 6th email, I just asked that he please mail a check to my home in the amount of $99 and I provided my home address. It's now July 17th (nearly 50 days later) and I never received a check or a follow up email.   Writing a bad review would have been my very, very, very last resort. As I expressed in my last email that I just hoped that  they would use instances like this as training opportunities to better serve future customers. We are WELL past that and now I have no shirt and no resolve to my issue. I find it very frustrating and disheartening that I never heard from anyone from his store, that I had to seek HIM out multiple times, when all of this could've have been solved easily and so long ago.   It seems as if I'm not the only one who has been through this. Don't take your stuff here.

My new lunch obsession. So fresh, great flavors, and online ordering is always a plus. I was craving the Southwest Salad when I was hungover, that's how I know I really loved it. I'll be working across the street soon so I can't wait to be closer! =)

My group and I had a poor experience on Friday, I emailed the restaurant directly on Saturday (to avoid having to post a poor review) but have yet to hear back. Our server Elizabeth was actually great up until the end of our meal. There was a group of 5 women who were dining there before a concert out at Ak Chin Pavillion. She mixed our tab up with the table next to ours, called me on my cell, and had us turn around to go back and sign a new tab when we were already on our way to the concert. She apologized profusely, and I understand that mistakes happen, but management took no ownership of this situation. We were overcharged by quite a bit, but didn't catch it since we had split the bill. She was told to relay a message to our party that the previous checks would be voided and to call back the following day to have a manager adjust something off the tab... I don't understand why this couldn't have been handled by a manager at that moment. We had already turned around after leaving, we were all confused as to why we were told to call back the following day to ASK for money back? Furthermore, I emailed to explain and give feedback and I haven't even received an acknowledgment. I just feel this could've been handled differently, and I would hope this doesn't happen for anyone else in the future.
