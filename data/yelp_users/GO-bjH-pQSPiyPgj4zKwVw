I was nearby and wanted to find a place to try out. I browsed Yelp and found this place. The name caught my eye because someone mentioned this place recently to me.  This restaurant is small - about eight tables. You go up and order & pay for your food, then find a table. They have real plates and silverware, which is nice.  I had a cheese enchilada with red sauce - home made, not out of a can - and you can tell. I tried both al pastor and carne asada street tacos, which were quite tasty as well.  I would recommend checking this place out! They are friendly as well. I want to try the green sauce - that'll have to wait til next time.

I highly recommend the burgers. Damn fine pies. Haven't tried anything else. The burgers have this herbed butter on them. Impressive.

We stopped since we were at Freestone Park. I had the Chile Verde burrito and it was delicious. The salsa was also good. I liked the atmosphere. There is an outdoor patio though we sat inside.  I would go back again.

I so desperately want to like Cafe Roma. It is a small place with a take-out area and a dining room. When you walk it, it smells incredible. I have yet to have something that tastes like the smell.  I've had the Penne with meat sauce. The pasta was overcooked and the meat sauce was average. The lasagna is above average and threatens to be good, but doesn't quite make it.  The side salad is okay as far as such things go. It consists of mostly iceburg lettuce with a middle eastern type olive thrown in and a sprinkling of some kind of field green. The salad dressings I've tried are bottled.  There is a daily pasta special.

So, I wanted to try a new place and came across Secreto on Yelp. I stopped by on a Friday; I was the only customer there. The service was excellent (I would hope so!).  I ordered the smothered burrito with the adobada and green sauce. This came with yummy rice and beans. Everything was good. My only complaint was everything was not bland but not spicy at all (to me), which is surprising given the style of Mexican food they serve.  I got a side of their habenero salsa which definitely spiced things up. Bit I would recommend they kick it up a little bit.  Nice atmosphere, the booths are Richardson's-like.  I would definitely come here again.
