Not only is the food amazing but we tried take out a couple weeks ago. My husband had an issue with his salad and when I called Lauren was all over it. She really went above and beyond and made up for the issue.

My family and I visited this location for the first time a couple weeks ago. The waitress was good the food was good the customer service was not as I would have expected from a steakhouse at this price point.  When my family ordered our meals everyone was happy with their food. Everything looked great. When I cut into my $38 T-bone it was over cooked, bummer but it happens. The waitress was nice about it and agreed it was clearly over done and took it back. My husband got the New York and his was cooked beautifully. The issue is that my whole family even my 6 year old finished eating before I heard anything about where my food was. I stopped the waitress and asked if they could make it to go or simply take it off the ticket as everyone else was done eating. The manager came over and apologized and I understand things happen. The brought out the meal in a bag and though this basically prevented me from eating my dinner with family  the manager did not even so much as offer a free desert or any type of "peace offering". I assume it is because I wasn't a jerk about it. I accepted the apology and we still tipped our waitress well but I will not be returning. Even at Olive Garden they go above and beyond if something is not right.   Just for the record I cut into and notified the waitress rather quickly of the issue. I also did not eat any of it or whatever other weird things people do I simply just wanted my steak cooked correctly.
