This is my local bar. I go here when I want to go somewhere to unwind. If you go on Saturday nights, Terri should be bar tending and she is a trip. She is a great bartender and a lot of fun to talk to.

This is one of my favorite places to eat. The burgers are amazing. They also make delicious soups and salads. This is a great date place too.  The decor is hip without being too hip, if that makes any sense.

I had heard this place made good burgers from a friend and they were right. I like the them a lot more than an most fast food.

Yum. This place has amazing food. Eat here today. Leave now, you won't be disappointed. I came at the recommendation of several of my friends. I was not disappointed. But, I am mad at myself for not coming here sooner.

Great place to climb. I love that there is a place to climb in the west valley. They just repainted and it looks really cool. A lot of fun routes to be found here.

Great coffee, great service, and a smoker friendly patio! Stop by if you need some coffee and you are in Glendale. This place wont disappoint you. It is a little hard to find, but it's worth it. Plenty of shade on the patio too! Did I mention they have Wifi?

I was weary about ordering the pork based on some other reviews. But it was juicy and tender. The seasoned onions were a great addition. Do not pass up the opportunity to try the rice with black beans.

A typical Starbucks.  This one has panty of power outlets though and is a great place to study if you are a student looking for free WiFi.

Great food and great service. The place is so much nicer on the inside than it seems when you see it from the street. Every time I go there I leave happy. Their Thai ice cream is amazing. One caution, the food can be very Spicey so if you are not sure what level of spice to choose go at least one level lower.

Not my cup of tea. It feels like they are trying way too hard to be cool or hipster. That said, everyone else I meet loves it.

This is a fun place to have a drink. The bartenders are nice and they have a good selection of beer. Is location is great.  There are a lot of places to walk around nearby.

This is probably my favorite place in the valley.  The coffee is awesome,  the food is awesome, and they often have really cool art.  They host fun artsy events too. If you have never been here it is a must see place in Phoenix.

This is a great place to bring the kids or a date. There are sculptures, a xeriscape garden, cool old buildings, and lots of animals like chickens,  peacocks, rabbits, turkeys, cats, etc. They just run around free. They also have a rose garden. The city of Glendale hold events here occasionally as well. There is also a decent amount of shade.

This place is great. Decent food, great beer, great service. They let you bring your dog, which I love. The down side is their limited parking. But, they have valet parking,  so they are trying to help mitigate that issue.

This is a wonderful place to relax in Old Town Glendale! I love it here. The food, beer, service, and patio are all great! They have a cigar and dog friendly patio! As a matter of fact, they also sell some cigars if you forgot your sticks at home. That is a HUGE plus for me since it is becoming so difficult to enjoy a cigar in Arizona. Another thing that I like is that even though they do have a large craft beer selection, it isn't just ales and IPAs. They have a craft pilsner as well. The back patio reminds me of my travels through europe, where many outside seating areas are between two buildings. Haus Murphey's is next door and you can often hear their music while sitting outside.

This place is really good.  If you want to learn bjj and mma, this is the place to go. This is a legit fighting gym. If you just want to get in shape this is a great place,  but it is even better if you want to fight or compete in bjj, muay Thai, or mma. Also, they are not high pressure sales people. If you come out for the free week and somehow decide it isn't for you, they won't constantly harass you with calls asking when you want to sign up. But I think you will fall in love with the place of you come try them out.

Swing by if you get a chance. You wont be disappointed! Sam is a great guy with a VAST knowledge of cigars. His recommendations are spot on. If you're smart, you will try his own blended coffee.

This place has the best pulled pork sandwiches. The first time I had one I was in love. I actually dreamed about that sandwich later that night. The only real downside to thus place for me, is that it is a bit pricey.

the best shop in the valley.  Joe and Sug are friendly and helpful. Their prices are great, but the atmosphere is even better. One of the factors rarely mentioned that can make or break a cigar shop are the regulars. If the regulars are annoying it doesn't matter how great the owner and manager are, you won't want to stay. The regulars at Baxter's are awesome. You will come by for cigars but you will stay because of the people. Don't believe me? Follow Baxter's on Periscope (@BaxtersCigars) to get an idea what an typical day is like.

Awesome shop! This family owned shop does a great job working on your vehicle and cares about the community. The day i went in, they were giving free oil changes to vets! They also have art hanging from local artists.

Nice place. Cool antique furniture. Nick cares a lot about cigars and is willing to answer questions and make recommendations. Great drink selections. Food is good. They have a couple TVs in the cigar lounge in case you enjoy sports. Small cigar selection. But, they put a lot of thought into what they do carry. They just opened, so the selection may expand in time. I wish they had different ashtrays. Glad i brought my cigar rest.

I was beyond happy to hear about a new cool place coming to Old Town Glendale. However, my experiences have been extremely disappointing.   Before I get into a story about my experience, let me say this. Desert Rose needs a real manager. Whoever is doing it now has no idea what they are doing. Please, for the love of god, get a good manager; it might save this place from going under.  So, my latest bad experience. I showed up one night with a couple friends and asked if the outside seating was available. I was told it was and the hostess sat us. Time goes by. And more time goes by. Then even more time goes by. Now, I am getting more thirsty, hungry, and annoyed. But! Light at the end of the tunnel! I recognize one of the bartenders from my time hanging out in their cigar lounge. I approached her and asked who the server was for my table and she told me that the hostess wasnt supposed to seat anyone there because they didnt have a server for those tables yet. I guess they had planned to put reserved signs on the tables, but no one did it and no one told the hostess. Genius. But, the bartender stepped up, even though she was slammed, and took our orders. I ordered a steak, well done. Probably an hour and a half later, it arrives. It was rare and cold. The potatoes were cold, the broccoli was cold, the only thing that wasnt cold was the beer i was sipping while waiting for my food to arrive. Did I mention the hostess had given me plastic silverware. Have you tried cutting a steak with a little plastic knife? I'm just glad the steak wasnt hot or it would have melted my fork.

Meh. I just wanted to have a drink. Had to sit through a spiel that included the question "do you know what a distillery is?" They told us to sit anywhere, then some guy at the back said we couldnt sit at a table in the back because "it is for the distillery tour." Cool, next time put a sign on the table or dont tell us we can sit anywhere we want. Also, no menus. So, hopefully you have xray vision because the "menu" is written in chalk high above the bar....blocked by hanging lights in mason jars.   I got an old fashioned, they dont make whiskey yet, but it was decent.
