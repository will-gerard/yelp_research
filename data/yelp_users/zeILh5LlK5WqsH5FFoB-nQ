Wow! I am absolutely blown away at the level of detail in this car service. I feel like I should be paying more money for this kind of awesome.   Agree with others that this is a sketchy area of town, but the people here are nice and seem to care a lot about their quality of service. Will definitely be recommending and returning! Oh, and you can get $2 off with a Yelp check-in! Woohoo!

I've been out to Schnepf Farms several times in the past year for various festivals and to pick my very own fruits and vegetables. I just had to write a review, because I am so thankful that a place like this still exists on the outskirts of Phoenix.  The family run farm is fun and relaxing, especially on a nice sunny day. They have a Country Store stocked full of delicious butters, oils and preserves made from the farm's produce. Not to mention, you can take a hay ride out to their orchards to pick various types of organic fruits when in season. And even though it is intended for children, they have an amusing little petting zoo where many of my adult friends have enjoyed getting up close and personal with the farm animals!   One thing that I have noticed in visiting the farm and engaging in their social networks online is that the family owners are the ones who actually run the place. Imagine my surprise when I got in line to order pancakes at the peach festival to find that Carrie Schnepf herself was making them over the grill! This kind of personal involvement really makes Schnepf Farms something special.  Overall, Schnepf Farms seems to be doing everything right when it comes to running a small family business that actually does significantly benefit the community around it. I can only hope that they will continue to grow in the direction of their goals, which are humbly acknowledged on their website.  My only recommendation to them would be to encourage the development of their online presence, which has the potential to generate more visits to the farm. The family does a great job of updating their Facebook and Twitter profiles, but seem to be in need of some help when it comes to turning their website into a central hub of information that is easily accessible. While there seems to be a lot of great content on the website, it is very difficult to navigate through. This is the only reason I give them four stars out of five.  I look forward to visiting more often throughout the year to experience the farm in all seasons. I would definitely recommend Schnepf Farms to everyone, regardless of age or whether or not you have children, this place is a nice escape from the rush of everyday life.

As long as I've lived in or around Tempe, I can't believe it has taken me until today to try this place out! They are definitely my new favorite spot for breakfast, and I can't wait to have lunch there sometime. The food is all local, which is really important to me, and doesn't receive enough attention. It is a big deal to invest in our community, and this place does it. They also recycle and compost!!! Awesome! The food was delicious and unique in flavor. My only complaint would be that their coffee wasn't exactly up to par. Although, I am a bit of a snob when it comes to coffee. And do note that this place is wildly popular, so if you go on a weekend morning, be prepared to wait a little. Sit outside and enjoy yourself on their cute little patio!

I honestly had a terrible experience here and would not recommend this place to anyone. As many other reviewers noted, I paid for expedited 6-7 wk shipping and my dress did not arrive for 10.5 weeks. The sales associates had no good explanation for this and basically told me they could not refund my rush charge or help me in any way.  Luckily, my dress fit almost perfectly when I first tried it on. I requested a small alteration to bring out the seems on the sides of the skirt since there were pockets that didn't lay flat. Even though my dress was over 3 weeks late, they told me they couldn't have the alterations done until a day before the wedding. After arguing with them, they moved it up two days. The day after, another bridesmaid went in and was told her dress would be ready even before mine. WTF  I picked up my dress today and it fits fine. Honestly, the alterations look terrible though. You can see the machine sewing along the waistline and the seamstress just told me a belt would cover it. After coming home and trying it on again I noticed that the hook in the back is missing. I will not return to have them fix it.

I've been a member at another local gym that also has "Fitness" in their name, and they are nothing like Competitive Fitness! I have never been to a gym that really challenged me like this one does. The trainers actually care about your progress and work with you to modify daily workouts to fit your abilities. So, you never have to feel like you can't do something. In fact, they'll help you have the confidence that you can. The gym has a WOD or "Workout of the Day" which everyone participates in. There is always a trainer around to help answer any questions and motivate you. Members are very friendly and supportive of each other. I would recommend this gym for everyone!

I always wonder who the people are that leave one star ratings on restaurants with overwhelmingly positive remarks from other reviewers. Like, were they just having a bad day? Or is the universe out to get them?   Whatever their misfortune, I can say that my first experience with Chanpen was quite fortunate indeed. I was stuck at home all day with a cold and wanted Thai food desperately. I've literally lived in South Phoenix for 4 years and have never tried this place! I called to order take out and it was ready in 15-20 min.   It was easy to locate and the place was quaint and cute inside. The woman who answered the phone was the same person at the counter and she was quite nice. She gave me a complimentary bottle of water with my order.   I got green curry, because it's my favorite Thai dish and I am very picky about it. The only other place in town I like is Thai Basil on University. But, the green curry at Chanpen was delicious! It was thick and creamy, just as I like it. And the vegetables were cooked to perfection. I ordered a mild spiciness and it came just perfectly for me. Great first impression. Will definitely be back for more.

It was maybe about 5% better than what I would imagine McDonalds must taste like. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with no meat. The cashier asked if I would like avocado, so I said yes thinking it was being offered as a substitute, as I've experienced in many other cases. But they charged me a dollar for avocado, which turned out to be a spoonful of store bought guacamole. The cheese tasted like chemicals and my boyfriend's Americano tasted like watered down coffee. Eat at Matt's if they're open, or walk across the terminal to Starbucks.
