OK OK... as a Proud Italian I hope my momma don't see this! I'm actually going to give D'moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons. Last Friday, me and my 2 brothers left the suns game, and proceed to put a few "adult" beverages back. At around 2am, when Haney's shut down, we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza (its better than our normal Jack in Box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing). Low and behold, the ONLY spot that was still taking orders (up to 2am!) was D'moes. Now, 1st off - I live at Summitt (by BOB). These guys gladly delivered to me, all the way down there! Major props for that. 2 - They understood me... considering I don't remember ordering the pizza (I woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad, and me saying "who ordered pizza" then I burped... wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo. 3 - apparently, after checking my voice mail, the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes (we were REALLY jamming out to Rock Band, in case you don't know, were pretty awesome. Wikipedia that Ish ladies and Gent's; Kansas City Bullriders). Well, the driver and my door man both called 3 times. I'm assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out. Maybe he had a slice with us? Who really knows these things. However, I do know that I was insanely impressed with D'moes... from the left overs I ate the next when I could remember. It was pretty darn good. Between the awesome'ness that is called "their customer service" and the legit taste it left in my mouth, I'm a believer, unless, if I say I'm not, will I get a commercial?... hmmmm.... Potential there....

First off, I'll admit that this is the only place I'll take my ride too in Down Town Phx. Of course, to be unbiased, that's because its the only place to take your ride too in DT Phx. So, let's be real. 2nd'ly, I drive a Tahoe on big rim's. It's not the easiest thing to clean, and i refuse to do it myself (my own laziness gets a 1 star for car washing, I'm awesome but not THAT awesome). Also, it's black. So double dipper here. The service is fast and friendly, which i love. Danny's needs to take a group field trip here to learn customer service! LO's defiantly has the upper hand in the area. And for the price (i pay about $20 for the works wash every time) it cant be beat and i cant be too sour on it. It's really just minor things; sometimes they forget to wipe out the deep dish rim's thoroughly, or there are minor water spots, or little stains left on the wood grain. Nothing really major, but I just expect perfection every time (which I'm well aware that would only happen if i washed myself, and most likely it wouldn't happen because my ADD would kick in half way through and I would be driving a half dirty half clean whip around town). Also, they have a punch card as well which is very nice! Buy 10, get Numero 11 free. All in All, defiantly 1.5 thumbs up from me; hoping for a full 2 soon.

The location deserves 5 stars alone! Next door to amazing pizza, an epic wine bar, a hell'ofa good time pub and NooooooBoooooooo (thats how i say it, i like to sing or over pronounce everything i do except while in the shower. i have dislexia). The building is cool; you will find this to be my bunker once the zombies invade. its all concrete. i have my pirate bandana ready. the exhibtis are cool....for kids. if your an adult, you may want to only go for certain things. pirate exhibt? body art? maybe a model railroad convention or a "build a science project style volcano and come blow it up here" event. But if you love science, and howthingswork.com, you'll never leave (and at $23 per adult for admission and $18 for a kid, you may be like me and DEMAND a sleep over; the seattle science center does this for kid field trips, it was legend...airy). lots of cool things to check out like a bike on a rope, and you pedal over the 1st floor from the 2nd floor and the people below you walk under you (yup, you guessed it, i had to look up and mess with a person on a bike). electircity, cameras, HD and different rock things from all over arizona. the coolest part though, was it is really all about AZ which, not being a native, i know nohting abour AZ other than the local bar's (um, big up's to all the Yelpers out there!). all in all, if you go for a specifc thing (like i did for hte pirate exhibt which is a 5 star event), my tip would be to make an afternoon of it. Hit Rose and crown for an app and a drink. then SC for a bit. then Bianco for pizza and wine. then get the hell out of my down town you freaking tourist driving the wrong way on a 1 way street (the other tip; READ THE STREET SIGNS or pay the price). Dueces.

For big box chain book stores go, there are none better than this B&N. the location is conveintent (given its not a major hioliday) since it is connected to the chandler mall but has outside access. always clean, well lit and a great assortment of books. If i need an actual book (as oposed to online version) this is the spot. hit it on an off day, grab a book and relax at the coffee bar inside to mellow out.

This is an East Valley staple; almost as old as the jet next door on the concrete pillar circa 'Nam. the outside bar has sand on the ground and its not like that nancy Sandbar sand, no way jose, this is the real deal most likely hauled in directly from Rocky Point in the bed of a F150 Ford Pickup. everything here is a 5 star; service, food, drink, atmosphere. however be warned rookie: DO NOT order from the patio. you must go inside to order your meal. you will receive the shit from the owner if you do this. we split some fish tacos, a bean and cheese burrito and a steak quesidilla. all excellent and quick. if you like authentic mexican food and belive that Fily B's aint authentic, then get your butt here. stat.

I haven't had the opportunity to pass out here, drunk, yet.... but it's on the the to do list! I love the that they have GB as the "hotel restaurant". how can you beat that? um...with an epic pool party and a roof top bar. that's how. when you combine all 3 things, you get an awesome hotel experience. topped off with friendly staff. its like an ice cream Sunday, complete with cherry, for adults. I'll be here this summer for many pool parties. when i stay here, I'll update my review as well.

just got back from lunch here. it was simply D'light'full. I'm a big fan of the Thai, and this little hole in the wall spot did not disappoint. soup, salad, chicken pad Thai, egg roll all for $10. fresh, home made goodness. A+ all day.

Just grabbed a Togo order from this pei Wei, defiantly the best one I've been too. The building is an old brick spot, located below Side Bar and sharing a wall with Starbucks (heaven on earth perhaps?). Legit city style complete with exposed wood ceiling beams and brick walls. The sode machine is intense though, user be warned. 1 spout, 100+ choice, all touch screen! this aint for your grand pappy!!! Great, fast and friendly service. Line moves quick. Togo has their own door/cashier. Only problem is parking. I come here for Starbucks sometimes and every-time vow never to come back due to parking. Maybe I just need a longer fuse? On second thought, Nope. Improve parking please.  Thanks. 4 stars only due to parking being such a pain.

Oh, you little broker of sushi you. how fun you are. whats that? you dont like sushi? well. dont fret. they also have sliders. yeah. like chicken. and beef. and probably a spicy tuna slider also. but only if you ask nicely.   i've only ever been for happy hour, and it hit the spot! we tried about 5-6 different menu items, all at least 50% off ($20 roll for $10? yup. 2 please). drinks are strong; who doesnt love that? probably the same person that doesnt like my reveiws because my witty banter is lame. ha!   seriously though, its awesome. try it. you'll love it. trust me cause im trustworthy.

This is purely a Lunch Time review; i have never been here for dinner but am told the price difference is insane. For lunch, pop in and sit at the bar. get the Bowl w/Brown Rice ($9 w/Tax & Tip) or the Steak/Chicken Combo ($13 w/tax & tip). comes with a salad and some water to drink. service is great, food is awesome, and they always have ESPN on the tv. perfect.

only reason i gave 4 stars is because it's a chain (support local). honestly though, this location is by far the best Big Box Sports Store i've ever been too...and i've been to all of them from "Tukee-Chandler-Gilbert-S S'dale-Phx-N S'dale. this is the one to go too. service is great. fast, freindly. everything is a hit. Plus, with a yelp check in (and, who doesnt check in now'a days? man up) you get $20 off of a $100 purchase. do that math. also, they have a new rewards card. its free. like Yelp. Free on the wallet, warm to the heart. check it out. ya'dig.

Absolutely the WORST customer service experience, on multiple occasions. I thought after the 1st time, maybe it was that person or that department. Nope. just went in for my 5th time since moving from Chandler to Down Town Phx. I WILL not be back. ever. period. This location is Terrible. Ive never written a bad yelp review, until now; nearly 12 hours after going and im still PO'd. I'll save the extremly long review because this macys doesnt deserve the time of day, nor anyones hard earned Money. Go to Biltmore or Chandler Mall instead; or Nordstroms. At least they understand our money keeps them employed.

I consider myself to be a Thai Lover, not an afficiado. however, where i come from (an office with windows and AC) this is amazing Thai! best place in DT Chandler for lunch; if you want a legit review please see Anna M's (she hit it on the head). Now, here's what you gotta know: 1) i love all things Thai; Thai hut, Rama, basil, elephant. i live in down town phx and have literally, 8 within walking distance. i get my fill. Lat Ocho (theres always day laborers looking to paint your house or car or face or clean your house, face or car in down town chandler. i was once mobbed by a herd of 23 while driving a uhaul...but i digress). 2) the ambiance is by FAR the best of any Thai spot I've ever seen. 3) I'm slowly going through the menu, and love it all. the pad Thai is bomb. The curry will make you smack your cat. and the egg rolls come in this paper thing which makes them healthy ( a healthy tasty egg roll? get the F out'a here! your cat is gonna be in pain). 4) you'll see Anna there. say Hello. she owns chandler. literally. 5) the staff is on their game. water refills @ half glass. just for fun once, i threw a fork. they brought me a new one before picking up the old one (that's a good trick BTW. if they pick it up, and give it back to you, get the heck out. stat styleeee). down town chandler is becoming a meca of great life. this is certainly a reason why. give them a try. you wont be disappointed.   Oh, forgot. drunken noodles isn't called drunken noodles here. just ask them, they'll show you the dish. and its BY FAR the best DN I've ever put into my gut. i felt bad purging the next morning because it was so good. yup. just happened.

this is my go to cleaners in the east valley; they do a fantastic job. I've been going here for years. you can even bring them back the hangers, and they'll reuse them! totally a green cleaner like the name implies. My only complaint is that one time (out of 1,903,453,856,023,945) they "misplaced" my clothes. the problem was that there is another person with my same last name in the system, a female. I'm a guy. they tried to hand me a dress. um....no. not even on Halloween do i play that way. at first, they thought i was joking. OK, i get that. my followers know I'm a funny little dude. i told them what i thought happened (which is exactly what happened) and they said they'll look into it. the next day, they found my stuff (about 23 items; all dress shirts and dress pants. how the women with the same last name grabs this instead of her 1 DRESS i have no clue. if i could review her, she would receive a negative 5 stars. rep the name genius). HERE'S"S my grief with the Cleaners: no discount for the situation. I'm not a cheap person, however i am in the cst service industry. and i know if you, as a service provider, screw the pooch (especially in an over crowed market like dry cleaning where they're next to every Starbucks, massage parlor and Walgreen's around), you offer something more than an I'm Sorry. this one time, and its the only time anything bad has ever happened here, is the reason for the 4/5. 10% off? come on man. were talking $6. I'm in weekly. you know my name by heart. lets get real.

So, I had a mid week appointment down town to look at a loft and decided to bring the girl along for a date night. I wasn't sure what to do at first, she wanted either Mexican or pizza (can't go wrong with either, IMO!). After posting a forum question (Thank's to my boy Brian T) to the Yelp'ers (which promptly high jacked the thread, and some great shananagins insued), all the regulars weighed in with either Cibo (over pizza bianco due to the wait) or Gallo. We (really, she's the boss in this releationship lol) elected for Gallo due to the Roof Top bar, and the fact that they were having the Flamenco Dancing.  Well, we showed up around 7:30. Parking was a sinch, ton's of open spaces. And as we were walking up, we both said "sounds like a party is happing!". Sure enough, we walk into the lobby of hotel Clarendon Hotel to a full house (never would'a known from the bare parking lot). The Dancing was in full effect, and raging like a bull in a china shop! Naturaly, I wanted to walk over and join in however its for professionals only. Amateurs may only watch in pure enjoyment.  We walked through the awesomeness to the hoestes, who sat us immediately (no wait?!?!? Wow!). We were promptly greated by an extremly polite server (So sorry, my memory is like swiss cheese. I wanted to mention his name though) who took our drink order, and suggested a Margarita for the girl. Naturaly, I needed no suggestion on alchol; I selected a nice White wine (pairs with Mexican food like garlic to bread) and we were off!  We ordered the Elote corn, house guacamole for starters. Both were amazing! Im a big fan of elote corn (thanks to an amazing sister in law and brother, I found out about this treat!) and the guacomole was super fresh! For dinner we split a Carne Asada Meat Torta and a Carne Asada burrito. Both were amazing! We split all of this, and were stuffed to the brim...with left overs! i spent $60 for 2 great drinks and all of this food. perfect date price!  I will be going back as often as I can! Great atmosphere, decore, and food is out of this world!!!   Only bad things;   The drink she ordered at first, a Prickly Pear Margarita was out of service (not sure how that happens, but OK, your busy. I understand...this once cause I got the glare, not Gallo). But the 2nd one hit her spot perfectly.   Noise. Definatly our fault. We knew the Dancing was going on, however we could barely here our selves speak and we were about 40 feet away from the shindig. During winter, when its on the roof will be great!

I can not say enough about this fabolus spot! From the patio, to the long board bar (and the long board on tap!) I've been several times, and every person ive brought, or come with, loves it. Great date spot, great pre funk bar, or after hours wind down location. Everything on the menu is bomb! From the Shrimp spring rolls, the ahi tuna, the fries (sweet potato or regualr) the hula burger.... OMG... im craving Hula now! thank's yelp, for making me think of this moth watering spot!

What can i say about this little gem that hasn't been said? So many positives. so few negatives. i guess the only 2 negatives i have are these; 1) it takes about 10 minutes to get a drip coffee on Saturday when the farmers market is going nuts. 2) there is no "line". much like all things hippie, it's free form. meant to be self regulated (which, in all honesty, I'm OK with after your 1st visit or if its not busy). be prepared to make Friends while asking who is in line and who has ordered their delicious treat already. seating is cool, patio rocks. and its attached to the little store (which I'm not reviewing in this review). if we had half stars, i would give it a 4.5. i may round up after trying it out on a non-market day. but if you go on Saturday, like i said, expect those 2 tips up top and you wont look like a banker that belongs inside a Starbucks (who, me? nah). BTW, service is amazing!

the Quarter is nice. it's uptown scottdale. if you know what your getting into, then your good to go and you wont be disapointed. if you have no idea what i mean by "uptown scottsdale", then you wont like it. it's pricy and meant for shopping and dinning. dont forget about upstairs; thats where all the fun is at (ipick and Tanzy!). also, know that the valet you drop off at, must be the one you pick up at. i hate that. i want to drop it off at one of the 19 valet stands (all run by the same company) and pick up at any. wouldnt be difficult to do. but, alas, im an 'sdale snob. I'm going back to watching anthony bourdain now.

How many great things can one say about the Cartel? Does Infinity work! Yes, that was a statement, not a question. I am in love with the CC, hands down. I have traded my gold Starbucks card in for this amazingly Delicious start to my day. The iced coffee ( actually, its Toddy, which is better) is amazing. They roast their own beans, and allow the iced coffee to sit over night, creating an extremely potent concoction. The hot drinks, A+++ as well. And, the food? A+++++ (5, yup its that legit). Grab the cheddar bacon muffin... its literally heaven. No joke. Heaven. Little clouds may form above your head; white clouds of course! Not those nasty rain clouds. OK, maybe not clouds. But defiantly your day will be sunny because you stopped into Coffee Cartel. And not because you live in AZ. Duh.   Only complaint I have is the hours. I live right next door, and their only open M-F (like so many places in DT-Pho).   PLLLEEEEAAAASSSEEEEEE open up for the weekends!!! I'll work for free! Well...wait... I'll come visit.

this reveiw is ONLY for the exam department. i have no experience with the front area that has all of the glasses (yeah yeah, i went to a glasses store and didnt look at glasses. i do things like that. I'm a regular rebel without a cause).   1st thing to do: ignore the front desk staff. simple. theyre short and dont have a big personality. but who cares? im there for a reason, so are they. hand me my form to fill out, and leave me alone while i fill it out. simple. and thats what they do.   2nd thing: enjoy the eye exam. have fun with the  Doc's cause theyre awesome and easy to talk to.   the one thing didnt like was that you HAVE to have a contact AND glasses exam. you can not have only a contact exam. kind of sucks. but all in all, i will be back.

just called this golds to adjust my membership fee; im currently payoing $50 a month, and am out of contract. so i want to adjust my cost to the new price of $20. However, you can only do that in person, from 3-4pm, monday through friday with the GM! WTF?!?!?! when i asked what happens when someone works 8-5, and cant get there, the answer was "you'll have to take that up with the GM". really? after 3 years with you, this is how it is? seriously? freaking joke. sucks too because the staff is freindly and the gym is great but I also go to the one in Tukee, and will give them my business over down town. i guess when you know you have a monopoly in the down town gym arena, you can strong arm people that are willing to take it. F this golds and their "ELITE'ist" 'tude. turds. dueces bitches.

Living down town has its pro's and con's. Cent is absolutley in the PRO collom! I've been meaning to write my prases about this little hidden gem, but every time i try the words in my mind do not come accross properly in written form. Simply put; it is mind blowing and mind numbing all wrapped up in a bowl of mussels. with endless bread. and a Duck Pie (pizza for you none in the loop folks). seriosuly, Chef Erik (C?) and his wife have an amazing place. it all begins when you walk in, and are greeted by a 7' tall Roman Soldier! Yeah, no joke. how freaking legit'amus is that??? Epic status. right then i knew i was going to love this place...well, to be honest, the 1st time i was here i was drunk and the soldier looked menacing so i mooned him. now were cool. sit on either the patio or at the bar, both have solid aspects. at the bar, you can watch them cook and talk up the chef (owner, ruler, king of the soldier). patio is perfect for a date; pop a bottle, start with some Brie Cheese with Rasberry jam and some Rossoto followed with a stone cooked pie. Nothing will make your woman jump your bones faster than this. 100% money back gaurentee (monoply money of course, im not a Model and therefor not Rich). all in all, try it. you will not be disaponited. ONE TIP THOUGH: Call 1st. reservations make this small little slice of heavenly pie fill up fast. park right out front, walk in, do a jolly little shimmy shake cause you got in, and enjoy a mouth watering explosion in your gut.

Oh lordy lord lord. where shall we begin? Let's start with Breakfast, shall we? 1st thing is 1st; the Disclaimer ya'll. Ive only been for breakfast. however comma the lunch menu looks epic and anyone who can make a person who hates breakfast fall in love with breakfast all over again deserves props for the whole menu. i will update my review for lunch someday...problem is, I'm not allowed to go to the same place more than once a day and i come here for breakfast. so, hence the problem. Also, since my Delorian is broken (Popsicle gas sucks), i can not currently go backwards ( IE: delete button broken, ramble shall continue on). Well, any great breakfast joint will have 2 things IMO; fresh, home made Mimosa's and NFL on the TV. check and check. parking? a cinch. easier than a valet. Greeting? always warm and inviting. Cool bar seating/normal seating? you guessed it folks, the price is right. Food? O....M.....G...... my goal is simple: try the entire menu. the problem? I'm stuck on item #3, on my 19th visit. do that math. Luckily for me, my girlfriend has amazing will power and is on item 14 and is a small eater. guess who gets her dish? This Guy!!! i haven't had one bad thing. My favorite is BY FAR the Chili Pork Tostada. The braised short rib egg Benedict is so good, you'll literally O Face at the table. no joke. for you followers of me, you know how i feel about places that make your wet dream a reality. seriously. incredible food. also, 2 other awesome things; the patio is legally allowed to have dog's on it and they have a dog menu! how cool is that? answer: freaking cool man! also the bathrooms are so weird and unexpected...its like the Blue Man Group, i could try to explain it to you but it just wont make sense. you have to witness it for yourself. PLUS - if you want healthy, they have egg whites, turkey, spinach omelet. AND a drive thru for phone ahead orders AND AND protein shakes also. whats that now, like 8 PS's? told ya, backspace button has been deleted.

I've been here a few times since they opened (i live next door), and have always had amazing food, drink and service....untill (Que Law and Order Theme Music here) last Sunday night. When Alissa (the manager) is there, its a well run machine. Greeted politely, seated immediately, waited on perfectly. Sunday was the first time we went in, and she wasn't there (the on duty front desk mgr ((get to that shortly)) said she had worked the past 10 days in a row and deserved a night off; no question!). We were seated immediately on the wonderful patio, between the water fall and the fire pit. ordered drinks and apps, all came out fast and amazing as always. However, after an hour and 10 minutes of waiting for our main dishes we were beyond livid at our Stoned Out waiter. he seriously must have been in the back playing guitar and yanking on his curly white boy hair. we never saw him and when we did he continued to make excuse after excuse. At one point, he said they were plating our food....43 minutes later we saw him again. Then he blamed "the 14 top that was just seated"...um really? they were eating when we walked in; and they were THE ONLY ones in the entire place!!! When we Finlay broke down, and asked for a mgr, he immediately came over (Chris i believe) and asked what was going on. 2 minutes into the conversation, he said "stop, let me get this handled" and went to get it handled. our food arrived, along with out POS waiter who didn't say a single word. he just sat our food down, and left, never to be seen again. Chris came back over, and told us our entire meal was comped (all martinis, sodas, apps, entrees', everything!). I understand bad seeds. The only reason I'm still at a 5 star is because of the management, the normal service, and the food is beyond tasty. But, be warned of 2 things: you will pay a premium for the quality (worth every penny to me as long as hippie isn't your Waiter) and 2, if a white boy with curly hair and Cashed eyes is your Waiter, move seats out of his section. If i see him when i go back, my review will drop to 4 stars. Alissa, please smack him around a bit.

I'm not close to Jamaican, nor am i an expert in their culture but i do know how much love i have for their "items". My boy Brian T (below) got a door hanger for this new Jerk Chicken spot close to home, and was telling me all about it as we were sipping some mojitos at RumBar with the owner of RB. Well, of course he chimed in, and the 2 of them decided to tell me that i needed to try it Stat. Next day, off i went for lunch. Walked in right as they opened, and was immediately greeted by (i assume) the owner. extremely nice man. he was filling the cooler up with water, and his young daughter was helping out. His mom (i know cause he said "mah") rung me up, and (i assume again) his wife made me my food. Is there anything better then supporting a local, family owned and operated business that ALSO has 5 star food and service??? nope!!! Jerk chicken wasn't dry, wasn't too spicy (the hotter the better, just like all things in life ;). The location looks dicey, but use the back door VIP style and your set up for the promise land. quick, convenient, tasty, and all under a polite roof. so good.

It's no sens saki. Everytime I'm here I miss sens more and more. Food is always amazing. Hence the 2 stars. Service here sucks. Just watched a bar tender drop a drink mix shake all over people at the bar! I've never seen that in 13 years if drinking. Ever. I miss sens. So much. Without the food, this place would be out of business. Sad. Signed, huge sens fan.

Can't cancel here if you signed up at a different location. Even as a black card member. Plus a hidden $58 fee to cancel. 3 years as a black card holder and the ending is a joke. I recently moved to surprise and there is no PF anywhere near there. I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap rates = cheap service. Shame. Off to awahtukee to cancel because you can only do it in person.
