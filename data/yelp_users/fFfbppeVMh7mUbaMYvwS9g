I was really excited to head out to Harlow's for the first time. The parking lot was packed but the wait wasn't as bad as I expected (for a group of five). Coffee was fine nothing special. Service was really good. Our waitress was very attentive and the food came out super fast. The two stars come out when I saw my plate. I ordered the biscuits and gravy (with sausage links) and it looked like the most unappetizing dish I've seen in recent memory. The biscuits were these tiny square atrocities and the gravy looked so bland with just a couple of micro sausage bits. I know it is biscuits and gravy, not always the most beautiful dish but the taste was pretty bad too. Everything tasted like it came out of a package. Now I realize this is a diner and the food isn't always the best but with the price premium on this stuff it is not worth checking out. The food was over $8 and the coffee was $2.55 My roommate had the chorizo burrito and enjoyed it but said it wasn't anything special.  Also, if you decide to go with a group of friends, bring cash. They won't split the check.

Fat Tuesday's is one of my least favorite places on Mill Ave. When it's not the college crowd (and even when it is) Fat Tuesday's is filled with some sketchy folks. I've never had the food but the drinks are so-so. The slushy gimmick isn't worth going to this bar more than once

Lux is the place to go to if you're looking to experience Phoenix. You'll encounter a varied amount of individuals that inhabit the midtown area! All of the food I've had so far is great, although it is a bit on the pricier side. I also suggest pre-planning if you are going to study. The internet isn't the greatest  so download any books or articles you need ahead of time!

This is my go-to coffee shop! Awesome and friendly staff. Whenever I head in there I know I'll be taken care of!  All of the pastries are made in house and they are usually great! I'm glad that there has been more variety lately. I would like to see more options when it comes to food. Everything I've had is good but specials every once in a while would be nice.

Giving the Big Bang four stars might be a little generous but it can be one hell of a night. I've been there a number of times to see my drunken friends get up on stage for their 21 Birthday. On the Weekend and Thursdays this will definitely be a college bar. The Piano players are good and most of the time very funny.  My biggest gripe about the Big Bang is that it tends to get old fairly quickly. It's a real novelty so after your first time, let a little time go by before your next visit.

I LOVE Cornish Pasty Co. The Food is excellent and they have a decent drink menu. I'm not a Vegetarian but the Vegetarian pasties are AWESOME. I sometimes order the Veg. version over actual chicken a lot of the time.

I have to echo a previous comment, this place has gotten worse over the past year or so. Friends and I would love coming here for lunch - great food, good service. The past three times I've been here I've been really turned off. We were seated on the patio and waited well over ten minutes to even get a water. Our server constantly ignored us (had to waive him down to get coffee and soda) and we waited well over a half hour for breakfast burritos which came out cold and bland. I'm planning on avoiding this place from now on, which is a shame. This used to be a local spot I really enjoyed
