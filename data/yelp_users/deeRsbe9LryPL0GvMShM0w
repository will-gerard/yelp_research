Rude to larger groups.  We like to stop there after we land from the airport, and before our large group heads to put hotel, but they always act like we are an inconvenience.

I have had the opportunity to work with A+ Nannies on several professional levels. Firstly, my boyfriend & I have used her babysitting service to watch over his son and nieces during an evening out with friends, and I must say our sitter went above and beyond the call of duty. The sitter arrived early and in a timely manner. She immediately became interactive with the children, and she even challenged them with fun activities and games before we were scheduled to leave. At the end of the evening, we were delighted to see the kids sound asleep. Not to mention the house was in better that nice condition. The toys were cleaned up and put away. Dishes used for snacks and popcorn were washed and put away. Most importantly, A+ Nannies does a screen check and drug test and they are very reasonably priced.  Secondly, I am an instructor for CPR/AED/First Aid. Hilary, the owner and founder of A+ Nannies Inc. has been utilizing me and my company to certify her nannies. I must say, it has been delightful to work with her, and her nannies. I look forward to many more business opportunities with Hilary/A+ Nannies Inc. and emsCPR.com.

I started going to Rejuvena since 2007, and regret that I have not wrote a review sooner. It was called something else at the time, but they still have the same WONDERFUL staff. I don't even use a primary care physician anymore, because I trust Dr. Jain with all of my medical concerns. Intentionally, I began going there for laser tattoo & hair removal, and eventually kept going for IV Nutrient & Detoxification Therapy. I have referred Dr. Jain to several friends who also see him regularly now. I believe in his practices so much that I even did a segment on Fox10 News. You can view the interview at this link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=3XPy8Vv6y1Q  I cannot go without mentioning the women of his office either. I have booked organic facials just so I could visit with Kimberly, who was my laser technician, and who I now consider a friend.  Sadly, I have moved from Arizona, but I will go back to Scottsdale for work. I will most certainly schedule office visits during those times.
