I travel frequently, work late, and don't always have time to make reservations before a late meal opportunity. We were greeted In an unwelcoming manner at 9pm at this Morton's. That along with waiting a solid 10 minutes before getting menus just made us feel even more "rude". The stuffy vibe needs to change for us to come back....Morton's is nice and convenient from the Ritz,  but i'd drive the extra few miles to City Hall next time. The food was good although the Seafood platter - oysters, lobster, crab were below average compared to other Mortons. Steak is probably better in the desert.

I've visited this location numerous times. While I understand you need an appointment to get any help at an apple store, this place is always mayhem. The staff member that assigins you an apple member is most likely told to lie to you in order to keep you waiting as long as possible - before you completely lose your patience. I got to the store at 10am on the dot expecting to simply buy an iPhone 4 and get on my way. The place wasn't busy at all, and I had no questions. Just charge my card $395 for the phone and mobile me, take my info and i'm gone, right? Not so fast. I walked out at 10:45. They said they would help me right away, and I stood waiting 25 minutes until I could be helped. Three times I was told "someone will be right with you". The last guy that helped me was nice ,but that didn't makeup for the experience. It's sad apple is such a profitable business with such awful, understaffed customer service. If there was another option out there that was comparable, it would be a no brainer to switch.

Well priced sushi for what you get. Not top notch, but better than your average sushi joint. The assortment of rolls is very basic. If you don't like California rolls you may not like Sakana. My favorite roll was the dragon roll I asked for (not on the menu). The valentines day special with 3 pieces of tuna, albacore, yellowtail, salmon and another tuna was very generous for $16.99. I'd come here again, but I will be able to wait. It would be a 3.5 but since sushi isn't a specialty in AZ I'll round up.

Shady management. Takes forever to get ahold of them.  Decent health club but a bit outdated. Great if you are 40+ and looking for a social scene.  I was a member here for about 5 months and originally put the membership on hold because I travel half the year. The guy I signed up with was suppose to cancel my membership shortly after, but the freeze was never changed.  Instead of giving a 30 day notice that I was unaware of since I thought it was canceled, I got charged for $230 for a month. You'd think they would maybe reverse a charge (for never even going) to keep future customers.  I'll make sure NOT to recommend this gym to any friends or athletes. Checkout Independence Gym.

If its italian night it's Oreganos hands down. I've been to this location 3 or 4 times now and have always left uncomfortably full but very satisfied. Last night we went and started with the Toasted Ravioli's. It's a must get app. The jalapeno cheese inside is perfect.  Then we had the big rig with meatballs and the chicken artichoke lasagne. The big rig still stands as my favorite pasta dish (I like it best with chicken for the health factor, although the meatballs are great). The chicken lasagne is absolutely phenomenal - so much flavor, cheese and chicken. If it wasn't a heart attack I could have it once a week.   We splurged and finished with the pizzokie...big yummy soft choc chip/white chocolate macadamia cookie covered in ice cream. One of my favorite desserts ever.   I wish Oreganos existed in San Francisco!

It's disappointing it took me years to finally come across Orange Table. I've been here twice and the past few weeks (before the weekend crowd rush) and have had two fabulous meals. I highly recommend the green flannel if you are into jalape√±o (it's very mild). The monkey cakes are also some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The only downside is the tucked away location...I'd go here over breakfast club anytime.

This place is awesome and it replaced Trader Joes as my new grocery store. The produce is plentiful and fresh, they have Boars Head at the deli, and they have organic options. The meat is way more reasonably priced than AJs. It reminds me of a small Whole Foods without the ridiculous prices.

Don't expect perfection or anything too fancy at Kyoto. It's a hidden right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Their sushi is decent and well priced for what you get. This is our very casual go to with friends when we don't want to drive up to Sakana. Hot saki (bombers) come free with beer - potentially a great spot to get a nice buzz before a night out in Old Town.

This review is for happy hour and it's very solid. Everything is $3 from 4-7. Three of us took down four drinks each and 4 apps and it was $50. Not bad at all. The Brie grilled sandwich was pretty outstanding and so were the wings. The French dip was mediocre, but hard to beat for $3. the margaritas were light and very good- tequila, agave, lime juice - better than most places! Definitely one of the best happy hours in town for food and drinks and service.

I came here twice in one day. Yes it sounds creepy and weird, but it was Easter and nothing else was open in wonderful Pittsburgh.  The service was excellent, so this review is for the food. I had the mixed grill first - salmon, filet and ahi (all medium rare) over the stir fry. At $33 I have to say it was worth every penny. I was starving and each of the three meats came in generous portions cooked to perfection.   My second encounter was with a burger which was maybe a 3 at best. I would not recommend the burger!   The Sonoma decor made me feel like I was close to home in the SF Bay again - I will be back to both!

This review is for the mini golf - and it's the worst mini golf I've ever been to. We paid $13 for 18 holes and played 36 in less than an hour. The first course was so bad - hardly lit, rocks everywhere, and lumpy, old AstroTurf. It was hard not to justify skipping the 18th hole and playing the next course. This one was a little better because you could actually see the holes, but still pathetic. I wouldn't go back unless they renovate the whole course!

The food here is solid, especially for Pittsburgh. If you are staying downtown at the Westin, it's one of the better options (in one of the worst areas of the city IMO). We had a variety of food and all of it was on par for the pricing.

What a Capital Grille! This was quite a disappointing steakhouse to say the least - we had an awful seafood tower - the crab was dry and tasteless, and the other seafood was far from fresh. The waiter dropped calamari on my lap and didn't seem to care. My bone in ribeye was decent, but it didn't make up for everything else. At this price point this Capital Grille needs to clean up their act.

Something about this place just doesn't have me excited to go back. The salad bar is what I would expect at that price point - but nothing too over the top.   Obviously most people come for the meat...yes the variety is awesome, but the meat is great to so-so to poor. We had an abundance of their least quality steak coming around as well as bacon wrapped dry chicken! In over an hour we only saw many of the meats once. I asked politely three times for the ribs, and after 20 minutes of waiting I gave up. I felt scammed - the pork loin was incredibly dry and a lot of the steak reminded me of zoo animal smells. How many times do we have to say NO to the sausage? I realize it's their cheap filler, but c'mon...  The highlight of the night was the filet, ribs (beef), chicken, the bread, polenta, and the mozzarella.   It was nice leaving full, but I'd rather grill at home next time!

Subways are all very comparable so normally I wouldn't post a review. This subway saved me on my trip from all the horribly unhealthy Pittsburg food choices. The staff was more than friendly on two occasions and impressed me enough to give two thumbs up.

Stopped in here to have lunch with a friend and was blown away by the pizza we got. The owner and the server we had were very nice and recommended one of the house specials - a chicken, artichoke, white sauce pizza. It was one of the better pizza's I've had in a long time (and San Francisco pizza is pretty awesome!). They have a bunch of special pizza ideas that I've never heard of & can't wait to try. The salads looked pretty good too.

I had the pear omelette today and it was outstanding. Very different for an omelette but it works with just the right combo of ingredients. The staff was welcoming too. I took a star off for the lack of hash browns - maybe one day breakfast establishments will realize that breakfast potatoes aren't exciting. It's all about the hash browns well done.

I feel like I went camping. I don't know where to start!  My first room was infested with crickets. Noisy chirping crickets. I got moved across the property to another room (prepare to walk!). The room looked like it hadn't been occupied in a while. Within 5 minutes I captured 3 moths. The toilet seat was broken and the sink drain lever was broken too. I'm sure this hotel is a woman's dream...NOT!  The rooms here are nothing like I expected. I've worked and lived in Scottsdale on and off for 10 years, so I had relatively high expectations for this hotel & the rooms. My carpet was old and you could see the base boards since they didn't cut the carpet to fit the room. The decor is awful unless you are born pre-1950. The bathroom is spacious and somewhat remodeled - although the shower is tiny and the tub is 1/3 the depth of a normal hotel tub. The sheets were marked up and overall this place just felt dirty. I felt like I was staying in a two star motel.   I'm glad I wasn't paying for this hotel or I would have instantly booked a room elsewhere. The Royal Palms down the street is much nicer!!

Outstanding secret self car wash. Always well maintained. Cheap, relaxing, safe!  $5 for 15 minutes, or $2 for each 4 minutes. Costs me $4 to do my large truck.  Make sure to use the spot free rinse as the last step to avoid the nasty hard Arizona water!

What a great concept MFF is. I ate the food at the Scottsdale location on and off for about a year. Not everyday, but frequently enough to say I was a regular. The menu never changed and I was ok with that - healthy food comes at a cost, and it doesn't always taste great. The results are what matter. After a year I was so burnt out, I could no longer force the bland meals down. I had a few favorites that I would come back to, but overall there wasn't much change.  Then I went to MFF in Southlake, Texas this past Christmas. The meals were great and I was excited that they changed the menu and added some new items.  Fast forward to this week. I had some of those same new items at the Scottsdale location. The Pork Tacos were so tough, fatty and overcooked that I threw away the whole meal. Angry. The corn tortillas are rock hard after you microwave them. Absolutely pathetic food.  I was also disappointed that the breakfast staple "Good Morning Sunshine" had been changed. She told me they now add tomato sauce to the ground turkey. Terrible idea.  I've decided that the chefs at the Scottsdale location use low quality ingredients and don't cook up to the standard of other MFF locations.  Time to try Sunfare here in AZ.

Three beers, two Brats, fries and a pretzel was our order ($50). Everything was mediocre. The beer selection is great and the concept of the place is pretty cool. I would give the food a 3.  Next time I would come here to drink and maybe have a snack, but I would not plan a meal here again.  On a side note, this cost them all stars. Flying a drone around for a half an hour while we ate outside was borderline ridiculous. They were flying this noisy thing over our heads and taking video or photos of us/customers and the restaurant. It instantly made us want to leave and was a bit intrusive for my taste...

We have tried out this ice cream shop a few times - really hoping we would love it. The cozy old fashioned decor is hard to walk past without wanting a taste. The reviews are misleading. Out of 5 different flavors, including cookies n cream and cookie dough, we were left completely dissatisfied both times. The ice cream is more on the icy side than creamy and it is flat out bland. There flavors are basic and there's nothing unique going on with any of them. The topper was the waffle bowl itself. It was soft, soggy and really just embarrassing. I would have rather had a stale one. Go buy ice cream at the grocery store and save your $10 for 3 scoops.
