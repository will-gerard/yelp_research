The food here is fantastic.  I have been here many times and am always impressed with the service and food.  Their patio is "dog friendly" which is important to me.  I recommend the fish dishes and the fried rice.  Also the hot and sour soup is the perfect food for a cold day.  The staff here is helpful and friendly and very professional.

Probably the worst pizza i've had in a long time. Sloppy, too much cheese and under-cooked.  Do yourself a favor and go across Reems rd to Ray's pizza and get yourself a top-notch pizza pie.

This is where I entrust the health and safety of my dogs to.  They are very good and professional.  The groomer here just spends so much time on my dogs she really seems like she loves them as much as we do.  I won't take them anywhere else.

Best sammiches in Surprise hands down.  I love their pastrami and cheese steak and they have some awesome desserts here too. I highly recommend.

Some real good food here.  Best Reuben I've ever had from here. I have loved every appetizer I have tried.  Large selection of beer and whiskey.  If they had a better red wine selection i'd go 5 stars.  I love to play trivia here.

I like eating here they have some good happy hour deals.  I think the atmosphere needs some sprucing up but they have already added some cool stuff like the "sushi cams," where you can watch the guys make rolls.  I would definitely eat here again

Don recently painted my house and I am extremely pleased with the results.  The price was very fair and his attention to detail was superb.  He patched many holes in the stucco.  He also painted the house quickly and even did things that were not previously painted like the doors and garage.  I have already sent him some referrals.  Thanks!

I love this place. Great breakfast deals and their fish sammich is killer.  Do yourself a favor and try their fish fry.  They have no cover ufc fights and trivia teusdays.  I come here all the time and I will keep coming back.  Sometimes the service can be a little slow but for the most part I can't complain.
