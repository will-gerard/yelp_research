Hey here's a tip - if you hire bartenders that can only do one thing at a time, hire more then two for weekend nights.

Great place for atmosphere and the food is always good. You are safe ordering just about anything off the menu but the peanut butter burger and the smoked cajun (wet is best) wings are out of this world. They even have a treasure chest where kids can pick out a toy to take home after dinner. Love this place!

The food was ok (had bruschetta and the limoncello cake) however, their hours state that they are open until 9 but they close the kitchen at 8 and started putting chairs up at 7:30. One couple walked in thinking they could order dinner and had to leave. Pretty poor business practice for a restaurant. If you want to close earlier, change your hours.

Best cigar shop I've been to. The owner is extremely knowledgable and very accommodating. Prices are good and the selection is awesome.
