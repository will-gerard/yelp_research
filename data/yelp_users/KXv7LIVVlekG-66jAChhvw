Went to Bob Taylor's Ranch house after a 104 degree day on the golf course.   Wasn't exactly pining for red meat after nearly suffering heatstroke on the course, but, my client (a former local) wanted to show me one of his favorite steakhouses in Las Vegas.     Bob Taylor's screams "old school" -- far away from the fancy schmancy nouveau steakhouses on the LV strip for sure.  This place has stood the test of time -- that should say a lot in Vegas.    If you want a no-nonsense perfectly cooked steak over wood fire with a side of garlic mashed potatoes with a martini straight up or a nice cab, you've found your spot.   No nonsense, no b.s.   I always choose a sirloin cut, and the folks at Bob Taylor's delivered.   It was the perfect size, seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly to a medium -- every bite was perfect.   Very reasonably priced -- far cheaper than what you'd pay on the strip.     The service was very good and we wanted for nothing.     If you want a straight up steak with no frills, Bob Taylor's is your spot.  A bit of a haul from the strip, but well worth the trip.  Big thumbs up.

AT last.....the long anticipated review of Chances Are.    I read the review by Michael C before I was knowingly dragged here by my g/f's grandparents.    And let me summarize it as follows:  Chances Are......that if you don't think that the "I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP!!" commercial is the rollins, then you certainly belong in this restaurant.   Let me explain.   The g/f's grandmother told us that she wanted to take us to this place because of the entertainment and dancing.   I'm usually game for anything, but, I didn't know just how NOT cool it was going to be.   We arrived at the restaurant, and, as Michael C noted in his review....it is  a100% geriatric establishment.   The inside is about as exciting as the Salvation Army down the street.  It's horrible . But you see.....therein lies the stark dichotomy:  old people LOVE this place.   Allow me to explain:   Upon arrival, the lounge singer "Jimmie" greeted us.  The g/f's  grandparents go to this place every Friday night, apparently.   Old people LOVE going to a place only to be acknowledged.  Period.  My parents love that.    They feel really special.   Well......when Jimmie the lounge singer says hello, gives a wink, etc.--people dig it.  Doesn't matter what the place looks like or what the food looks like.......they like the PREDICTABILITY of it all.  No surprises here fellow Yelpers.   So we sit down for dinner -- and order drinks.   The wine tasted as though it had been filtered through a sweaty gym sock.  No joke.  Later found out it was Vendage (i.e. "box" wine).  I couldn't drink it.  And I like Two Buck Chuck!  We sat for two hours watching the 60+ crowd get their groove on.  And.....for that reason, I say, keep this place going!!!!   Old people dig it!  The lounge singer was 100% geriatric, but the songs he sang brought the folks back to the "good old days!"  And they seemed happy !   Live and let live is what I say.........  The food--about as good as an old shoe.  Absolutely 100% old people food.  Tasted like eating in the retirement home.    But the old people LOVE IT.  Wow.   You wouldn't believe it, but ended up going BACK to this place the next morning for the $4 breakfast special.   It wasn't as bad this time around -- not sure if I was starting to blend into the Scottsdale geriatric retiree community and just giving up......but .....it wasn't too bad without the lounge singer....(sorry Jimmie-- your version of "Moon River" is just not my preference).    If you're 70 and over (which, doubtful you're here on Yelp) -- this is your 5 star place.  For those under 70 who get dragged here -- you are brave ,brave, brave.........

Wow.....there are some seriously less than glowing reviews here.    I'll go against the crowd on this one....  I thought the decor was incredible.  This is coming from someone who has Mexican blood flowing through his veins and who knows Mexican culture, art, etc.   The place is like a museum.   Whoever designed this place should get mad, mad props.  It's beautiful.  From the crosses, the paintings, Dia de los Muertos (Oaxacan art) stuff....go see for yourself.   We stopped for a quick bite here.  We ordered the vegetarian salad (served in a tostada) and nachos (w/o meat).  I thought the salad was actually fairly tasty.  It had a consortium of stuff (peppers, pinto beans, salad, etc)........I dunno, maybe I was really hungry.    The nachos--were not as good --but not all that bad.......  The service was standard.  I can see how some yelpers might construe it as horrible -- those beautiful waitresses do look like they have a bit of a tude.......  Anyways, go here for a drink to admire the decor.   It's awesome.

As far as going to "hip" places, Trader Vic's in Scottsdale is a cool place.    We rolled here on a Friday night while in the area.   On the night we went, there was a very cool salsa group playing in the outside bar.  (Salsa music and Polynesian theme???   I guess it's fusion....????)   Very fun.   The outside bar is very cool in itself -- very comfy lounge chairs, fire pit -- beautiful Arizona sky above -- perfect temperature in March.   Drinks are a little pricey (i.e. a Mai Tai is $10, but, what you got to fund Vic's retirement income somehow, right)?     The Mai Tai is the house specialty-- and after ordering one, you'll agree.  I personally mix up a stiff mai tai during the summer months, and believe you me--the bartenders at Trader Vic's KNOW how to do the Mai Tai.  I could slurp down about 4 of these in the hot Arizona air without even thinking about it.  Yum.....  The variety of drinks on the bar menu is incredible!  It's like beng in Hawaii.......some of the drinks are served in a fish bowl (like at "Sharkeez" in Southern California) with multiple straws.  Yeah, sure it's a little gimmickey, but it's fun.    That rum goes right from the bowl through the straw to your head in no time!    It wasn't super packed when we went, and that is just the way I like it.   You could definitely tell the rum was working--everyone here was having a good time.    If in the area, stop by for a drink.  Choosing between the variety of different choices of pineapple, rum, and , bourbon infused concoctions.....the best choice of the entire night might be to call a cab after you are done!!  Hic-cup!

These guys are COMPLETE jokers.    I ordered $200+ worth of blankets from them.   They claim 1-2 business days for delivery.  After a week, my items hadn't shown up.  I called them to ask what happened to my items and was told that they were "out of one item" and that UPS "lost" one item.    I called UPS and they said that they had never received the item!  What a bunch of jokers!  The customer service is terrible.  (They are only open M-F).   Go somewhere else.........
