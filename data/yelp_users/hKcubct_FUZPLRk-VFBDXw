Oregano's has huge salads, pasta and great pizzas.  They have amazing customer service on par with any high end restaurant.  I can recommend any of their salads, pasta or their Italian Gold wings are super moist and tasty. One of my favorite pizzas in the valley is their Clark Street meat pizza!  It is a little pricey but really good,

Best sides dishes of any of its competition and the chicken ain't half bad either.  They have changed their service to ceramic plates and metal siverware if you eat in.  The chicken has always been good and the sides great for a fast food environment.

I don't know why soo many low ratings for Outback.  I guess too many steak snobs! Its not Mortons but at 1/5th the price its just great.   Great service for a chain restaurant, great for family get togethers or a upscale after work meeting.  Service is always great.

I don't know why  Outback gets so many mediocre reviews it is not nearly as expensive as Ruth Chris, Morton's, The Keg or any of the other high and prime rib or steak houses.  How people can compare them to each other is unreasonable.  Once again for the price. Outback has always had great steaks, great service for a decent price.  I had there prime rib with vegetables and an add on of grilled shrimp and everything was great.   For the people who like the Outback grilled shrimp this location still has the remoulade sauce that is awesome sauce they use on the shrimp that the other locations have discontinued to offer on their menu.

The service sets this place apart, always top notch!  Pizza and calzones are really good but it takes a 30-45 minutes because it is made from scratch.  Salads are great and huge and much quicker than the oven items.  The heck of a slice is a great lunch as well it is out in 5-10 minutes leaving lots of time to get back to work.

All around some of the best bar food in Phoenix.  The wings have gotten a bit smaller over the years but they have a great taste.  I recommended the grilled hot wings.

Trendy burger place where everything is served as a slider.  Good food and the small size allows you to try a number of different burgers in one sitting.

This place is expensive for a quasi self serve food.  The meats were not particularly tender or anything to write home about as far as taste. For a $15 medium bowl I would skip this restaurant and find some place that's a better value, better quality and taste.

If you go there, go for the Girls, wings and burgers.  The rest of the food is pretty marginal. My pet peeve there is they bring out the sauces in the little vacuum sealed cups that you get at Jack in the Box or McDonald's, (come on this is a restaurant cant they make fresh ranch)??? It is a sports bar to and drink beer and watch sports,chat up the waitresses and watch sports on one of the many TVs.... dont go there expecting much more .

Not impressed. The staff was standing around, the pizza by the slice was limited to two choices that looks to have been sitting for a while and wasn't very good.  And no one seemed to really care.

The place looks like a lot of fun. The food is above average for bar food. The patio and the outdoor stage make this place look like a lot of fun

For the price this place is great... It is a hidden gem off the beaten path that you have too look for.. The owner is always working and is always friendly.

This is the best BBQ in phoenix right now period.  The St Louis ribs are what I usually get and have only been disappointed once out of 15 visits.  Also try their Bread Pudding for dessert it is awsome.

Great trendy hamburger restaurant.  Great place to people watch in downtown Scottsdale.  Lots of great hamburger combinations with a speciality pretzel crust. I really recommend the appetizer Nelson's Verde Con Pollo, i get every time I am there

Keep trying this place year after year to see what all the hubbub is about.  I dont care if they are rated the best in the country they are mediocre at best.  Smashburger, In and Out, and Red Robin are a much better products

I would skip this go to the State Fair instead your money would be much better spent.... a total waste of time and money.This event had huge lines to get in!! huge lines to get to tacos!!! no place to wash your hands!!! no place to sit down!!! and it was expensive and a $3.50 surcharge to order tickets online, and a minimum of $10 in tokens!!! not to mention most of the tacos were microscopic for the $2 tacos!!

They grill most things over Mesquite grill which gives them a good flavor.  All the meat is overcooked and a little dry but it is offset by a great taste of the Mesquite grilling and the Guacamole salsa add moisture and great flavor as well.  This place is always busy with locals having lunch and dinner.  The portions are a bit small for the price.

Had their Kobe/Wagyu beef burger at the Salt River Fields food truck festival and it was outstanding.  I wish they were closer because I craved another one for nearly a week after.

Not impressed.  Stopped in after the lunch rush.  I sat at the bar and the bartender seemed to be more interested in looking at his computer than any of the 3 customers in the joint.  The BBQ was good but not enough for me to go out of my way to come back again.

This is amazing BBQ!! I had the moist Brisket and Ribs, easily the best in Phoenix right now.  The bark on the brisket was tasty while not being to strong.   The Pork ribs were super tender and great tasting.   The downside to this restaurant is there is always at least a 20 minute wait, small inside seating but a large patio area.  You can expect to pay $2-$4 more a pound for the meats here so be prepared to pay a bit more here than others BBQ joints.

I had horrible service here.  When I arrived there were 2 people ahead of me.  3 more people arrived after me and after all 5 others were taken before me and after an hour and a half I complained and was met with a blank stare and a comment "I don't know" so I left and went to a Urgent care in Tempe and was seen immediately.

This place is just ok.  I keep giving this chain a try about once a year but nothing great. Jersey Mikes has a better product.

I went to this location after waiting for a hour and a half at an Advanced Urgent Care in Mesa and leaving. I went to this urgent care and was seen with in 10 minutes. The PA seemed very competent and all went well.

Good 60s style diner/restaurant.. One odd thing they only have 2 kinds of hotdogs on the menu,  why it's calling itself a hotdog joint I have no idea... The burgers are flame broiled and better than any fast food joint and they have an amazing number of salads on the menu, far more than they have hotdogs.. The fries and onion rings are pretty standard, they don't resemble hand made by any stretch   I would put the place on par with a Red Robin experience and quality but no liquor or table side service   Great place before or after a ASU game. Shopping at Tempe marketplace or movie at Harkins

The Italian beef sandwiches are the best in Phoenix I found. Also I'm not really a big fan of bell peppers but the sweet peppers they put on the sandwich here are really very good. I get my sandwiches dipped with an extra side of gravy on the side.
