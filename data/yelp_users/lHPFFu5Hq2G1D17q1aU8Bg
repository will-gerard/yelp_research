A hole-in-the-wall on Calle 16, best known for an entirely different class of south-of-the-border fare at Barrio Cafe, Mariscos Playa Hermosa does Mexican-style seafood better than anyone in the Valley. Each meal starts with not only the customary chips and salsa, but an outstanding complimentary ceviche tostada. Favorites include Seven Seas Soup, Camarones Culichi, and of course their ceviche, which comes in several varieties. Most dishes come with beans and rice, but these are not the typical refried pintos and tomato-heavy rice typical of Mexican restaurants. Lovers of scorch-your-mouth spices should try the guacamole, which is heavy on the jalapeno. Portions are huge and service is outstanding.

EHRMAGHERD I LOVE THE ZOO.  Unfortunately, the weather is only nice enough to visit for a few months out of the year, or I would practically live there.  The Arizona Trail is fantastic for local mammals, snakes, and insects. My favorite animal in this area is the Collared Peccary, aka Javelina, aka tusk pigs.   I love Monkey Village, with adorable little squirrel monkeys swinging around practically within reach (don't touch the monkeys).   The meerkats are always a favorite on the Africa Trail, as are all the animals on the Children's Trail (but especially the Ocelot and the Wallabies).  There's a free water feature for the kids, so bring their bathing suits and a towel during warm weather. Also bring hats, sunscreen, and maybe insect repellent year-round - even in cool weather the sun shines brightly and you will get burned, and bothered by bees.

Two appetizers, two entrees and an alcoholic drink for under $40. The soba w/ buckwheat noodles... delicious and gluten-free. I'm in heaven.

I love going to Scott's for breakfast. Very casual, seat yourself. The staff is very friendly and it seems everyone has worked there for ages - maybe family. Try the LEO (lox, eggs, onions) special.   Their sandwiches are huge. Seriously, I'm not sure how one gets his or her entire mouth around a bite. And, being from the northeast and a member of the tribe myself, I love the feeling of an authentic Jewish deli.

I'm pretty new to this whole fitness/running thing, but I know enough to know I needed to replace my old Sketchers before my feet fall off. After asking a few of my marathon-running colleagues, I visited Runner's Den for the first time today. I learned a few things. 1) Different running shoes meet different needs, 2) Athletic shoes, like dress shoes, come in different widths, 3) I have a wide foot, 4) I walk on the balls of my feet, 5) Normally people walk heel-to-toe, 6) My feet lean in toward each other, 7) So that's what my trainer kept getting on my case about, 8) I will never again buy running shoes anywhere besides Runner's Den, ever.

Some women like to browse in shoe stores; others enjoy a leisurely stroll through a home decor outlet. For me, a shopping trip doesn't get any better than The Pork Shop. It's worth the hour-and-a-half drive from the west valley.   If it comes from a pig, you will find it here, and it's the highest quality corn-fed Midwestern pork that ever melted on a human tongue.  Roasts! Ribs! Chops! Rib Chops! Hams! Hot Dogs! Snack sticks! Sausages! Brats! Bologna! Salami! Even treats for your four-legged friends. If you're feeling really piggy (ha, ha) and have a big enough freezer, The Pork Shop will cut and wrap a half hog for only $219.00. That's six pounds of bacon, 24 chops, a rack of spare ribs, two country ribs, a loin roast, a smoked bone-in ham, a smoked picnic ham, and 18 pounds of your choice of sausage, mix and match. That's enough pork to last a family of four for several months, or my swine-loving family of two through a couple of weekends.

By far the best and only choice for healthy fast food in the area. The food is always fresh and tasty. Only the slow lunchtime service gets them 4 rather than 5 stars.

I know people are going to disagree with me, and that's fine. The food isn't great, the service is iffy, the decor is awful, the place reeks of smoke from the lounge even though indoor smoking was banned years ago, but I really love me some El Charro. So much so that I drive from the far west side to Mesa for the experience.   Their hot sauce alone is worth the drive. The food is gringo-Sonoran, and is as good as any gringo-Sonoran out there. Tacos, enchiladas, tamales, chimichangas, you know the drill. There are also dishes that aren't found everywhere, like the Spanish Tongue Platter. This is something special.   If you like Sonoran-style food and 50s-style dives, El Charro is the place for you.

I'm a bibliophile. I'll read anything anyone puts in front of me. That said, if I had to pick a favorite genre, crime/mystery wouldn't be at the top of my list. So why does Poisoned Pen get a five-star review?   They're local, helpful, and THE place for authors who want to come through the Phoenix area on a book tour. Their local interest section is second-to-none, as is their inventory of signed first editions.   Even if mystery isn't your bag, Poisoned Pen has you covered with romance, general fiction, and an impressive selection of books for the kids on your gift list. If you like books (or need a gift ides for someone who does), skip the impersonal big box stores (and the internet) and give the folks at Poisoned Pen a visit.

"Take care of these guys," said the manager to the server as he showed us to our table. "Extra VIP. They used to be regulars. That means someone scared them away."  We did used to be regulars. We spent New Years' Eve - the only day for which they take reservations - at Barrio Cafe several years running, until last year when we decided to stay home. Nobody scared us away; we added a few new places to our list, and my husband's job leaves much less time for dining out than we used to have. We hadn't realized how much time had passed since our last visit.   The place still feels the same, with live music on Sundays and local artists' work on the walls. Since it had been so long, it took us some time to take in the menu changes. Is Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza's signature dish, Chiles en Nogada, really available year-round now?   We started with Barrio Cafe's amazing guacamole. During dinner service, the ingredients are brought out and the guacamole is made fresh at your table. Since this was brunch, it was made fresh in the kitchen. I am not complaining. I have tried to recreate this recipe at home and have so far been unsuccessful. Avocados, lime, cilantro, onion, tomato, and pomegranate seeds, right? Something else, obviously, but I just can't get it right, so I'll have to keep going back to Barrio to eat it there.  I didn't get around to asking about the Chiles en Nogada, because I was craving seafood, and the enchiladas mariscos satisfied that craving admirably. I couldn't tell you what my husband ordered, only that the bite I stole was delicious.   "Did you leave room for dessert?" The answer was no, but we were brunching at Barrio Cafe, so we ordered Pastel de Chocolate, chocolate cake filled with imported chocolate, almond and cinnamon sauce, and a pot of their smack-your-momma good dark coffee. I couldn't eat the cake, so I stuck to a few heavenly spoonsful of the ice cream with which it was served. The menu says it's vanilla bean, but I tasted hints of cinnamon even without the sauce.  It was, as always, a fantastic meal. If they'll have us, we intend to reclaim our sports as regulars - starting with this New Year's Eve.

Los Dos Molinos is a Phoenix legend for a reason!  Yes, the food is notoriously spicy. Yes, the service can be a bit slow on a packed Friday night. And yes, the restaurant is located in South Phoenix, which apparently scares the pants off of some people.  But the food and drinks are top notch. We usually come at lunchtime on Saturday and have never run into a long wait. Service with a smile, and both seating and food service are fast. Los Dos has the best carnitas in town, and the most potent margaritas. If you're lucky enough to go on a day when the green chili stew special is available, don't miss it!   Chef Victoria's amazing tamales are also available for the holidays. Which reminds me it's time to place my order.

I've been coming to Chino Bandido Takee-Outee, vaguely racist name and all, since high school. It's nice to know that some things never change. The Mexican-Carribbean-Chinese menu never changes, and neither does the flavor.  If you're a newcomer let them know, they have samples. Get in line, fill out a form with what you want to eat, pay at the counter, and take a seat. My standard order is a jerk chicken/hengrenade chicken combo with jerk fried rice and black beans. Any of their entrees are available as burritos or quesadillas. Sadly, I can no longer get these because of the damned gluten thing, but you should try it. Their tortillas are fantastic.  A combo with two entrees, beans, rice, a drink and one of their famous snickerdoodle cookies costs around $8. It really doesn't get better than this for that price. I had to knock them down a star because they don't have enough restrooms for the size of the space and because the last couple times I was there the food had cooled somewhat before it made it out to our table, but it's really good, even cooled down.

I was going to give them two stars instead of one because it's not their fault I don't eat pork, and for all I know the pork is inexplicably to die for despite the many shortcomings of their other offerings. My dining partner assures me not, so a sad, single, solitary star it is. It was such a crap experience all around that I made notes upon exiting the restaurant so I would be sure to adequately warn people away from this place.  We went at a weird time, around 2:30 in the afternoon, but if you're going to be open, you don't get to act put upon when someone comes in. There were three other occupied tables. Every single employee, from the hostess to the servers, had "I don't want to be here" written all over their faces. The salad bar/hot food buffet was good, but we'd barely had a chance to dig in when the hostess came over and told us that if we wanted anything else from there we'd have to get it NOW, because they were switching over to dinner service. That seems like the kind of thing you'd tell a customer when they first walk in the door, especially a customer who informed you, when you asked, that she'd never been to your restaurant before.   I ordered iced tea. It was warm, over a small amount of ice. The hostess told me she'd be right back with sweetener, then I never saw her again. The guys who came around with the meat seemed to think it their her job and none of them would bring any.  Speaking of the meat, it tasted like it was cooked, for far too long by the way, in prepackaged taco seasoning. All of it.  Petty complaint but as long as I'm on a roll, the busser asked for our help clearing the table. Not just "Would you mind handing me that plate?" which is fine with me in a casual environment, but "Would you stack that on top of that and hand me that? Thanks. Now the silverware..."  So after the aborted salad bar and the crappy, dried out meat and the surley waitstaff and the plate stacking (not to mention the pointlessly loud music), we asked for our check and waited - I timed it - 10 minutes. In a restaurant that now had only three occupied tables. Once our bill was retrieved, we waited another five minutes to get our receipt back.   I'm not a jerk, at least I don't think I am, so I don't punish bad service by withholding tips, but this is one of the very rare times that I wanted to. Instead I left my minimum 20%, made a mental note to never eat there again, and jotted down the aforementioned notes.   In conclusion, if you're considering eating at Brazilian Bull, save your time and money. Go to the grocery store, buy a packet of chalky taco seasoning, apply it liberally to an inexpensive cut of beef or chicken, then stick it in the oven on too high a temperature for too many minutes.  EDIT Since the owner of this now-closed establishment has seen fit to impugn my character, I want to specify that my visit took place in early December, two weeks or less before his business closed. I think his public attitude toward an unhappy customer is pretty good evidence that I'm not, for whatever reason he imagines, making up this experience.

I went to Phoenix Baptist, the ER nearest my doctor, straight from his office at his urging. He suspected my gallbladder and called ahead to the hospital with this information. After a few hours of seemingly every expensive test they could run except a HIDA scan, and after a very rude interrogation in which I was treated as a drug-seeking addict, I was released with pain medication, antibiotics, and a suggestion to follow up with my doctor.  Two days later I was rushed to a different hospital where the correct test was performed. It was in fact my gallbladder, something a HIDA scan would have found had Phoenix Baptist bothered to run it. I had emergency surgery and was in the hospital for nearly a week.  I should also mention that they kicked out the lady in the ER bed next to me because she didn't have insurance, although she had dangerously high blood pressure. Since she came in not for her BP but for a sprained knee they told her she'd have to be treated by her primary care doc. She was crying and saying how terrible she felt and would they please help her, and they refused. They spoke to this elderly lady just abominably. I get that they're a business, but would a little compassion and bedside manner kill them?

I've been here a few times for benefit shows and a few times in for drinks when they've been kind enough to let us use their parking lot for charity car washes. So much fun. My husband and I always run into friends at The Rock, and if we don't, we've made new ones by the end of the night.

I spend some time every Saturday at Whole Foods, selecting organic, locally grown greens, fresh fish, cage-free chicken, and gluten-free grains at a store whose management really cares about giving back to the community and treats its employees well. This allows me to feel really good about myself so I can justify all the sitting on my ass and smoking.

Nakama has become our go-to dinner spot. From their potent mixed drinks, decent sake selection, friendly service and and fun decor, it's an all-around great place to enjoy a leisurely meal. If you want a quick meal, avoid Nakama - good food requires patience and there are often large parties (or small parties like mine who order a sizable variety of nibbles).   I recommend starting with the Hamachi Kama if you can get it (it's seasonal and goes fast). For those who have mentioned a concern that the chefs use too much rice in their rolls, which is not something I have ever experienced at Nakama, skip the rolls and order nigiri. Their fish is fresh and expertly prepared.   For gluten-free dining, ask that cooking sauces be left off (you won't believe how much better the already amazing unagi tastes without eel sauce) and request tamari sauce in place of the soy sauce at your table. Nakama and Hana are the only sushi joints I've been to in town that are familiar with and prepared to help gluten-free patrons dine safely. If you know of others, please message me!

It's not easy finding good gluten-free dining in Phoenix. Since the closing of Mandala (about a week after I discovered it, natch) I'd come to the conclusion that I'd just have to deal with the few GF-friendly chain restaurants with their limited options. Then, I found Chakra 4.  Not only do I love the food - try the Nutty Rawvacado Dip - but the ambience is casual and relaxing. Perfect for a long weekend lunch. I love their selection of hot and cold soups, and they even offer gluten-free bread (locally baked at Gluten-Free Creations).   They are a bit on the pricy side for what amounts to soup, salads, and sandwiches, even if you're not ordering gluten free, but knowing exactly what's in the food I'm eating is important to me and well worth the extra few bucks.

I just can't.  I can't write about the amazing po' boys. The glorious boudin. The succulent fried green tomatoes. I especially can't write about the to-die-for peach cobbler a la mode.  I can't write about it because I can't eat it anymore. I'm a little verklempt, please give me a moment...  Ahem. Okay, that's better.  Try the gumbo if you want to live dangerously, it's spicy! And the crawfish boil is one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten, if also one of the messiest.  Go and eat all of the things. When you do, please have a shrimp po' boy for me.  I'll just be over here, hoping for a miracle drug that allows me to ingest gluten. If that dream ever becomes a reality, Flavors of Louisiana will definitely be my first stop.  UPDATE: I received the following message from the owner:  Hi Beth, Man do i have good news for you. We have a lot of Gluten free items on our menu!!! Yes i was a nurse for 25 years before opening my restaurant and Celiac disease was just becoming a known thing. So we can blacken any of our meats for you with our gluten free blackening seasoning. Also we fry in a mixture of corn meal and corn flour so no wheat flour goes in it. Just ask for your fried foods to be done in the cornmeal mixture instead of the flour. We have french fries, cajun chips, potato salad, cole slaw, dirty rice and red beans are all gluten free. Also if you come on Monday we have our Jambalaya and that is gluten free as well. So come on back and let us feed you some good and i mean real good gluten free food!! Jennifer Goff owner

We've been twice for the buffet. We are happy to report that Sutra has one of the tastiest and most diverse Indian buffets in town. Favorites include Chicken Tikka Masala and Vegetable Pakoras. Diners are given a choice of plain or garlic naan. It's not all raves and applause - The bismati rice was a bit over or undercooked (crunchy) on my last visit, and on both occasions the owner's long-winded chit-chat actually kept us from enjoying our lunch while it was still piping hot. Still, as far as Indian restuarants in the valley go, this one is tops. We hope Sutra, opened in April 2009, will be a fixture in Goodyear. We don't want to go back to driving to Glendale or Tempe to find decent (or meh) Indian cusine!

Fresh gluten-free pizza AND apps? Where do I sign up?  At NYPD Pizza, that's where!   We had to try it all, so we started with the Broadway Bruschetta and the Spinach Artichoke Dip. Both marvelous. They don't serve it with bread but with crisp squares of their gluten-free thin pizza dough; tastes like flatbread to me.   The pizza itself was also great. The ingredients were fresh and although I'm pretty sure the dough wasn't made in-store (else why offer only one size?), it didn't have the tell-tale little factory marks of a mass-produced, frozen GF crust. They also prepare GF items in a dedicated oven, which is important for people with Celiac Disease who must avoid cross-contamination.

Stopped by this weekend with my heart set on gluten-free bruschetta and pizza, and they didn't have any gluten-free products available. When you offer a service that nobody else does, it's important to actually offer the service. Very disappointed.

In the time since I sadly had to give NYPD pizza a single star for not having any gluten-free products available upon my visit, I've been twice more. Both times, as on my first visit, the food and service were outstanding.   I was also contacted by two members of management who were very apologetic about running out of GF items and who offered me a gift certificate for the inconvenience. I didn't accept it because I wanted my follow-up review to be untainted by the spectre of paid advertisement, but it was very nice of them to offer.

Hooray, another good Indian place opened up in the SW Valley to replace the late, lamented Sutra!  I've been going there for some time, but haven't wanted to review it after my Sutra jinx. Now they've been open for a while and always seem to be doing a brisk business.  I really like this place. Immediate, friendly service, good food, great prices.   As some have mentioned, the buffet can be a bit limited at times, particularly if you're looking for a 100% vegetarian meal. I'd skip the buffet and order from the menu. Favorites include vegetable and paneer pakora, aloo gobhi (spiced as you like it), and bismati rice. Don't miss their fantastic lassis, served sweet plain or with mango (also served salty, but that doesn't strike me as yummy).

The last time we were there, we went for dinner. The service was terrible, the food was meh, and did I mention the service was terrible? A waiter stood around playing on his phone and watching TV while we sat, waiting far too long for our meals, with empty glasses in front of us. At one point the manager came by, filled our glasses, and said something to the waiter. Then, later, the manager came by again and looked at our empty glasses, then followed the waiter over and watched while he refilled it. Why did we need multiple refills? Because it took so freakin' long to get the food out, that's why. Meanwhile, we're munching on the complimentary salty chickpea things they gave us.  There were only two tables to wait on. We generally only go for lunch, so maybe dinner service is always this bad and that's why there were no customers in the place at 7 pm.  An unfashionable hour to be sure, but it's the west side.   Oh, and the best table in the place was taken - by the waiter's charging cell phone. Apparently that table is next to a convenient outlet. So we were seated under a TV, which was awesome because it felt like the aforementioned waiter who was watching TV all night was standing there just staring at us.  Also took 15 minutes to get the check at the end of this exercise in excellence.  With service this bad, I'd have given a single star even if the food made my mouth sing. Maybe two. Probably not, though.

I get that a trampoline place is going to have customers sign a waiver. People get hurt on trampolines. I don't expect that waiver to contain the following:  "I further grant jumpstreet®, Inc the right to photograph, videotape, and/or record me and/or my child/ward and to use my or my child's/ward's name, face, likeness, voice, and appearance in connection with exhibitions, publicity, advertising, and promotional materials without reservation or limitation."  In the interest of fairness, Jumpstreet's competition requires an identically-phrased waiver. However, I wasn't considering going to the competition, I was looking forward to bouncing at Jumpstreet.  If you want me to appear in your promotional materials, you're going to have to pay me. I will, however, write a Yelp review for free.To demand that your customers agree to let you photograph them and their children as a requisite to admission, with no chance to opt out, is off-putting to the extreme.

A Poem.  I was feeling really lousy and  thought it was because I hadn't  eaten in over 24 hours since my stomach had yet to recover from yesterday's  disaster of a lunch. So I ate a light salad now I feel even worse. It's possible the disgusting meal I  forced down at Arriba yesterday  which left my dining companion and me with  what we thought  was severe indigestion  has actually spurred a mild  case of food poisoning

Every once in a blue moon, someone will suggest Reathrey Sekong and I'm like, "Yes! Let's go RIGHT NOW PLEASE." Reathrey Sekong is one of those places that I always forget exists, and I have no idea why, since every time I go I have an amazing meal. The ambiance is wonderful. It's one of the few places in town where one can step in the door and be instantly transported. The food, decor, and music combine to make the trip to Reathrey Sekong not just a meal, but an experience. It's one I intend to have far more often from now on.

New Asian Star is great for a lazy night when we're too tired to even go for takeout. Great prices, good food, very friendly service. Dine in, takeout, or delivery.  If you're not in the delivery zone, call for takeout or even order at the counter - they're fast.

I've been coming here for ages to get my nails done, they do good work and their pricing is competitive. But what I really need to let everyone know about is the amazing job Hannah did on my eyelash extensions. Long, thick, but natural looking; people comment on how great I look but they can't quite put their finger on what's different, which is exactly what you want when you've got extensions.  Be sure to call ahead, because Hannah is the only one who does eyelashes and the wait can be long. But if you have been looking for a place for amazing eyelashes at a good price, I wouldn't go anywhere else.
