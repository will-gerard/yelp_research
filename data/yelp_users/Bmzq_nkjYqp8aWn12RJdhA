We had two waitresses for our table of 8, each only did a section of the table but service was very bad. From our three drinks ordered, we only got two. It was pricey. We won't be coming back.

I went with my co-workers today and I had a Chicken Taco Salad. The service was fast enough for the place being full, the price was average, there was plenty of parking, and I had a great experience. I'd go again.

Based on some of the reviews, I signed up for the Cake Decorating Class. The place has everything you would want on a cake. I was amazed. I start my class in April.

I had my 1st class on Wednesday.  We went over Course 1. Basics on baking cakes, torting cakes, and icing cakes (more like crumb coating, but pretty thick so it's more icing than crumb coating).   Our homework was to bake a few, tort them, and ice them up. Also practice some icing techniques.  The class is small, short, sweet, and too the point. Like my reviews!

I had my second class. It was nice. We practiced the templates in the book and our instructor showed us little techniques that really helped.   The small class environment and the other students in my class are friendly and nice.  At the end of the class, we used our new found knowledge to decorate our cakes we brought in.

3rd week of course 1 complete. Next week is the last week. Today we did a bit more on roses/flowers, made a clown, and did some icing techniques. Lastly, we worked on decorating cakes we brought in. I've been progressively getting better. Pictures and all that on my website.   http://www.carmeloricarde.com/blog   I can't wait until next week and to sign up for more classes.

I'm a little sad. I completed course II and have to wait a bit until I can take course III and it will be under the new Wilton format. I am very happy though that I have taken the cake decorating courses, meeting the nice people at the store and in my class. I've taken a very large interest in cake decorating and its part of my life now. :)  I keep adding the cakes I've been making to my blog. http://www.carmeloricarde.com/

I really like eating here. From the time you order to the time you are eating, only minutes pass. I think I've spent more time in line at Walgreens. Their food is very tasty too. We normally get the Sesame Chicken and crab puffs, also one other entree but that one always varies.  Price is fair too.

I've been to C-Fu on numerous occasions. We even had our rehearsal dinner there and the owner was very courteous and did a great job delivering us a custom menu.  Recently, the day after my brother's wedding, we had a huge party and were thinking about all going out to dinner, we decided to call up C-Fu and they told us that there wouldn't be any waiting at all. They quickly took care of us all and then we all decided to hit up the bar and do karaoke. It was a blast.

This place is pretty small, yet very friendly. So far I'm not disappointed with the freshness of their food and the friendly service. I go there at least once a month for date night with my fiance. One time I went there and they gave us a free sushi roll. We usually get about 3 rolls with salad and soup and it's about $35. I'm going to keep going there for my sushi fix.

For some reason, I always get really bad service at this location. Went to buy a 55" tv and was often ignored. I went Friday for Memorial day sales, asked about it, they thought it would start on Sunday. OK, fine. Came back Saturday after I got a Best Buy email saying the sale already started, got no help, left, ended up buying a TV at a different store.

I'm glad I'm not a swimmer. The pool looks like a solution of dead skin and urine.  I've been going for about a year to this location. The normal gym equipment is in decent condition. I go about 4-5 days a week.   Every LA Fitness I have been to in the last 8-10 years, plays the same crappy music. I'd give a better rating if they just turned their music off. If you can't cater to everybody's tastes, then don't do it at all.

The place was fairly busy and we had to get our jewelry inspected. I'm not kidding, when I say we waited 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us. There was a few ladies behind the counter and they just didn't seem to pay attention and avoided eye contact. Finally a lady finished up with a customer and came over and she gave us her undivided attention and wanted us to be satisfied with the service. I wish all the other ladies in the store were like her. I think her name was Shannon.

I can't remember the ladies name but she was just great. We had to go to Zales afterwards for inspection of my wife's other jewelry but because of the awesome service we got at Jared, Zales was like a kick in the nuts in comparison.

Didn't care for the fact that we made reservations 36 hours in advance so that we could get there and told to wait while they set up for us. Is my expectation too high?   I still like the food and service though.

This is my primary happy hour spot when I'm hanging out with friends I worked with in Scottsdale. Jasmine is my favorite waitress there. There are times I've had drinks just show up on my bill so be sure to check.

They're getting better at separating bills and not having mysterious drinks appear on your own tab.  if Jasmine didn't work there, i'd have no reason to go to this location anymore.  i was told to stop giving hot chicks piggy back rides. seriously?  no redbull? wtf!?!?!

An air traffic controller strike in Jamaica almost cut short my honeymoon. A US Airways employee worked for 3+ hours to get us there the next day. Only because of her is why I like US Airways. Normally, I can't stand any airline or airport.

Not really my scene, but we went for a few friends' birthday and got a cabana/booth spot.   The Pros:  Our waitress was fast and courteous. The music was, for the most part, very good. The drinks were strong.  The cons: The DJ kept talking about and to some girl he wanted to get with. Honestly, nobody gives a fuck.  I hate it when there is a person in the bathroom handing out paper towels. It doesn't tell me that this place is high class if that is the attempt.  The cons have me giving this place a two star rating. If the DJ is really good, girls will go out of their way to talk to them. I don't need someone to hand me a paper towel. I won't go here or suggest this place as a place to go, but I will go if a friend is having an event here and invites me.

Probably the worst Walmart I've been to. Do not use them for oil changes. Some kid at the register tried to rip me off 48 cents and I had to talk him through using a calculator to do subtraction because he honestly had no idea. Effin' idiot! Plus there is a lady there in a wheel chair who will most of the time stare at you and tell you to hold on, then go chat with her co-workers. I hate this place!

I'm not impressed that it always takes longer to stand in line than it takes to shop there. Especially at lunch time. It's like the cashier sees the line has 10 people in it and says, oh, I better help this customer go through the newspaper and find a coupon for their affordably priced, cheaply made products.  I don't understand why I'm asked if I'm paying debit or credit when the machine asks me if to choose debit or credit anyway.  Streamline the checkout process and this place would be good-to-go.

The food was nice, what was even better is that though the parking lot was packed at lunch time, the place was not busy. As if nobody thinks to go to Grimaldi's for lunch because at dinner it's busy. I liked it. Calzone is better than the comparable one at NYPD.

Got my wife her Galaxy Tab here. Nice place. They only sold expensive screen protectors for it and only had 1 brand. Dumb. Had to go to Fry's electronic for the screen protector.  Also got my son a video game here for his PS3. This will now be known as my best buy.

As a former Alltel employee, I understand how things work. Stores don't control pricing of plans or phones. So its about customer service. We came in to buy ourselves some new phones. Every staff member we interacted with was kind and professional. They did try to upsell some accessories, which I guess I don't blame them. Overall it was fairly a pleasant experience.

I go to the lake a lot with my friends, getting jealous because they can wakeboard and I can't. I weight 250lbs so I totally sink their boards. I went to ski pro, talked with a guy and he let me rent a giant board that could hold me up, gave me some tips on getting up out of the water, and a bunch of free wakeboard magazines.  I got out of the water on my second try and ended up buying that wakeboard.   Some of their stuff can be wicked expensive (but high quality).

Many douche bags and old cougars. At least the night I was there. Drinks were alright and strong. Food was decent. My tab wasn't too bad.  I was wearing my Marine Corps hoodie there on the Marine Corps birthday/veterans day weekend, told I couldn't have the hood on, because it's against policy. Despite it being cold and raining and the propane heater we were next to kept going out. Every waitress was wearing their hoods. Not exactly fair is it?  My wife was cold, she wore my sweater with the hood on. That's ok because she's cute.  A bathroom attendant, only in the men's bathroom. No thanks.  Bought a water to take with me when the night was over. Wasn't allowed to leave with my water. Had to throw it away. Brand new bottle of water with just a sip out of it.

My wife and I just got back from Paris and I was craving some Mille-Feuille (Napoleon). This place is relatively close to our house so we decided to try it. The pastries were very good.  We made a large order later of macaroons and Napoleons. Though you need to give 2 days notice for larger orders, he had them ready for us the next day. He even gave me a sample of some other chocolates that he made. Gerald is a nice guy. He even called me later to thank me.

My first time having lunch at an Einstein Bagel. The food (sandwich and soup) was very tasty. The service was quick and the price was right.

Brought my family here, had a great time watching most of them see it for the first time. Hot chocolate was a little pricey but it was worth it :) It's a must!  The light show was nice. Really liked it!

Our furniture was just delivered this past weekend. Amazing quality. I'm sure my great grandchildren will use this furniture in a hundred years or so. Look at how awesome my furniture is! It is custom!  http://www.carmeloandjaime.com/his/highlights/2013/03/our-new-patio-furniture/

The service was really casual and nice. I felt like I knew the lady though I didn't catch her name. Weird. I had the very last item on the menu, the vegetable crunchy noodle. it was AWESOME! I need to bring more people here.

I'm not normally a customer so I consider it my first time, I wasn't sure what to really do but I wanted to add stuff to my ice-cream but got a pre-made off the menu one. It was a little busy so the staff weren't able to really explain to me how this works.  I felt it a fluke so I went again at another time and was able to get a better understanding and my interaction and order were fine. I'd come again.

Some days, you just want some soup and a sandwich and Wildflower is the place to get that. The staff at this location are friendly and it could have been because it wasn't busy that day, but the kid who came and brought the food to our table came back by to check on us.

Plain clothes, like tank tops with no wording on them are super affordable. A must for most men here in Phoenix.

I'm really happy we stopped here for lunch. Food was pretty good. Had to have some boba drink. I recommend that definitely.

Since my last review, I've come here a ton of times with family and with work friends. I love this place! I come here more than any other restaurant. I've tried so many different foods and dishes and have many favorites. Service is great!

I've been coming here for 5 years, there is low turnover in the staff and they seem to really know their products as well as cause and effect to pool water. I drive by 2 other pool places to get to this one.

I was really pleased with the location, the service, and the food. We started with fresh made samosas and then I had the Chicken Vindaloo with garlic naan. It was great! The chicken was very tender.

I like how this Chipotle is not famous yet so it's not busy

A birthday party and we brought to babies! they sure were patient and accomodating. food was great and I really enjoyed the zucchini fries as well as the sauce that came with sweet potato fries. burger was huge! wish the egg wasn't cooked so thoroughly on my breakfast burger, i like the yolk to drip into the burger and make a huge mess. but overall loved it.
