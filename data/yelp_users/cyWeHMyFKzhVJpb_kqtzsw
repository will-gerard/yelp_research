I contacted them via a mega apartment finding website and when the mega site followed up I truthfully told them there had been no contact.   Weeks later Adriana Ross contacted me to say it was a pleasure to have spoken. Either they are dishonest, incompetent or both.  Apparently this is so common the leasing situations and I hope some eager beaver law student takes consumer rights under their wing. This is just one example of a much more widespread issue.   Read the one star reviews I don't want to learn the hard way.

Denise, Your form letter does not fit the situation. I never set foot on the property but every communication and lack of communication just digs you deeper.

I had a delicious omelette, with potatoes and it hit the spot. Waitstaff was friendly and fast whether it was their station or not. It was obvious they liked each other and that warmth is rare these days. I look forward to eating here again and trying more items.

Hot, fresh and easy to find. Right off the freeway and if you're heading south on the 51 after you leave easy to get back on your way! Don't miss whatever is hot and fresh, they're extra good!

I've never been to Buffalo, NY but this is a little taste of home for those who might be craving a bite like from the ole hometown. Everything was top notch from the crispy on the outside soft on the inside bun to the delectable onion rings to the homemade horseradish which blows the creamy bottled kind away. The service was friendly and the table near me had a Buffalo native and their pleasure was evident, too.  The cooking area has an indoor bbq and they know how to use it. It's on the far west side of the Winco parking lot, so there's plenty of parking. I can't wait to return and try an authentic hot dog or maybe a BLT or maybe work through the whole menu, it all looked good!  P.S. It was a hybrid waiter service. You order and pay at the counter but they deliver to the table.
