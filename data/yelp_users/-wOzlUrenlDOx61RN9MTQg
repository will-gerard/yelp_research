I Wish I could give it zero stars.  Brought my car in for a fueling issue, went to pick it up and pay for the repair ($280) and received my car back with a lot of damage to my interior. My steering wheel has huge scratches and gouges in the leather! Made the service department aware immediately and didnt even take the car off the lot, left it with them to later be called by Ken the service department manager who basically called me a liar and that his department didnt do the damage even thought the had the car for 3 days and drove it 30+ miles!  now I'm left with a car that is worse than when I took it in and they are refusing to fix it, I will never take my car here again and I will tell everyone to avoid that place like the plague!

I wish I could give it zero stars. The food is amazing, really love their breakfast food but the staff are horrendous, being a manager myself I understand customer service and the guy (tattoo on his left fore arm) who served me had one of the worst attitudes I've ever come across. I can't understand how people like that are still employed in a customer service role. Terrible service. Great food. I won't be returning to this location.

Really enjoyed it the three times I've been. Tried the Pad Thai, Orange Chicken and the Spring rolls. Love all of them

Came here on the opening day for lunch and enjoyed it, went back a few weeks later for their margaritas and that night was great, huge selection of tequila and the staff are great too!

Had to update my review. I always make sure I give a place three goes before I leave a review. The food is great but the service is probably some of the worst I've seen, girls at the front when created are too busy texting to seat and acknowledge us, server had no idea about the menu and it took 30 minutes to get our drinks ( a Coke and a coffee). Restaurant isn't busy either, maybe 15 people in the whole place. Very confused how you can have such amazing food but such terrible terrible service. What a shame.
