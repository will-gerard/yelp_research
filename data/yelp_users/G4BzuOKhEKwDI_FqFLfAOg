You have a driver who just ran a stale red light on scottsdale heading north past grey hawk. I assume he didn't stop for the light because he was going way over the speed limit.

The blooming onion is awesome and the Aussie Fries were pretty damn good too. The beers weren't too pricey and actually the some of the coldest beers I've ever had.  Why only 2 stars? Some of the worst service I've had at a steakhouse in my life. The bartender was very rude.  She continuously made my buddy and I feel unwelcome despite there hardly being anyone else at the bar. We were hurried with our drink selections and then essentially made fun of for our choices. I enjoy outback and will return, possibly even to this location, but the service I received was poor at best.

Wendy Williams does not know a thing about customer service. If this wasn't an emergency and time sensitive situation I would have left after the first minute I walked in. She was extremely rude, could not make eye contact, her tone was completely miserable, and she made me feel extremely unwelcome. I can't believe people like this are able to stay employed in this day and age. Would rate 0 stars if I could.

Dane was awesome. Upgraded me from the $4 special to a $5 daily special. I was feelin sick and he hooked me up with a cup of chicken broth to go. Can't say enough how much little things like that mean. I'm already here a few times a month but I'll make sure to frequent this location more.

I've been wanting to try Dillon's for a couple of weeks since moving back to the west valley. I used to live near dillons arrowhead so I'm familiar with it.   This was my first time at the Thunderbird location and it went very well. I will be back.    The hostess was very nice and welcoming upon entering and gave me some good suggestions. I ordered the brisket sandwich with Mac n cheese and it was delicious. The brisket was a little dry but the Cajun BBQ sauce was on point. The bartender, Eileen, hooked me up with a free coca cola while I was waiting and while it may not seem like much, that coupled with the atmosphere and warm reception is something that will make people want to go back.  Next time I'll definitely check out the onion rings I have been deprived of for so long   I've had some fantastic BBQ in Kansas City and thjs isn't quite up to the same level when it comes to the food but the smell and atmosphere are right on par

After reading several good reviews of this location I decided to stop in. In and out in 25 minutes. Justin and Drew worked my oil change. Literally saved my Friday!! These dudes get it!! I'll be back and I'll be telling my family and friends!

Wings are on fleek. Usually pretty stiff crown n gingers. Bottomless mimosas during football? Love this place. The football specials are awesome. The chicken tenders are legit and not processed; they use actual meat. If you get the wings try the the honey chipotle.

It's In n Out, yes it's fast food but you expect quality with a big name.  I have been here several times over the past couple of weeks and relative to other In n Outs it is pretty good. The employees are attentive and polite. Double doubles all day. I'll continue to go out of my way to stop at this location rather than other locations that are more central.   And for crying out loud people, don't ever go to In n Out and not get a Neapolitan shake.. War Eagle

Unfriendly. Dirty, dark, old seats, the bathrooms are disgusting, it's just bad here. The wait was around 90 minutes for a new drivers license.  Yikes.

I went to TC's last night with a few friends, it was a good time. I would vote it 3.5 stars if I could. 3 doesn't seem fair but it wasn't quite a 4. The price is average in relation to other pubs/ bars.  I was surprised that even for it being  Tuesday they closed at 10. Not a big deal though. They have fried pickles that are perfect as long as you don't get one with too much batter on it. The mushrooms were good too! I would come back on a weekend to see if it's a little more lively. The food isn't typical processed frozen stuff but it has some fine tuning to be done for sure.

I love the Hero Sub here. I'm always greeted with a friendly smile and usually by not just one employee, usually every employee welcomes me into the restaurant. Being from the south this reminds me of a place back home that no other place around here rivals and the hospitality is up there as well. I'm a lifer.   The brownies are delicious. they have baked potato chips so you can feel like you're being healthy. I'm not a huge fan of the copious amounts of flavors but they do have the coke fountain machines with every flavor of everything.   ** found out by asking, that the medium hero has the most bang for your buck as far as meat servings go. Can't remember exactly how much but the medium hero is sufficient for an adult.

Wow.. How is a place this good hidden into a small pocket in anthem? This is hands down the best pizza I've ever eaten. Isaac and Tano helped me out at the register and prefaced the background of the restaurant while I was waiting... Every word made my mouth water more and by the time I got my food, my nose ears and eyes were all so happy. I got the stuffed pepperoni and ham with mozzarella slice.. For $4.75 I was stuffed to my gills and offering out pieces to my coworkers who were flocking to it because of the smell and overall visual appeal of the pizza. Gio's is the new spot. I will be a regular. They do things the right way and make you feel like family before you walk out of the door. They just get it.   Went back today and it was even better. The pinwheels are absolute fire!!! Karim the cashier was helpful and knowledgeable of the menu.
