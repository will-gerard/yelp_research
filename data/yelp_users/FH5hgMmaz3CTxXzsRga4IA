Havana Cafe refused my business today when I walked into their establishment wearing a trendy bluish, turquoise singlet. Apparently, this wannabe 4-star "cafe", that resides in a plaza for God's sakes has a clothing rule that says men have to wear sleeves, but women do not. I challenged, Keith, the waiter/proprietor, that my date was also wearing a similar sleeveless top and he proceeded to tell me that men are not allowed to wear sleeveless tops, and that if I were to eat there I would have to wear one of his awful red Hawaiian print polos with bamboo images on it that was two sizes too big! WTF?! So you'd rather offend me and require me to wear some crap Hawaiian shirt that I'm swimming in?! Mind you, it's 113 degrees out! In what world is this more "appropriate attire" than my tank and not outright sexual discrimination? For those of you who think this is a joke, it ACTUALLY HAPPENED!

This review is solely based on a pick-up food experience last night and it is not indicative of any positive/negative feelings regarding the ambience or dining experience inside.   So my friend Kate was craving shrimp fried rice, it was late, and after searching Yelp we learned that Chop and Wok was the only Chinese food serving establishiment still open. We called and made an order. Picked it up. The food was greasy and oily, simply not good, and certainly not gourmet (that is laughable, actually). We ordered BBQ pork, but were given BBQ ribs, really? Overall, the experience was highly disappointing. I have no need to ever go back, late-night or otherwise. My suggestion would be to avoid a late-night Chinese food craving and go for one of the many fine late-night options in the area.

I think I'm in love! What an incredible vibe. Am I back in Seattle? I love just about everything The Roosevelt has to offer. It has everything to make this a heavy consideration for the weekly rotation. The leather seating, multiple rooms and chill out areas, and great music offer an ambiance for any sized group. My only quibble is the fact they don't carry any cola products and they have a limited food menu. Otherwise, it rocks! I mean, don't come here so I can keep this place to myself. ;-)

I live at the Alta Phoenix Lofts and Bell has a convenience/VIP service with the apartment complex. I've had an excellent experience with Matt at Bell. He came to my apartment to meet me and introduce himself. Who does that anymore? Seriously. He has great energy. They've done a nice job with my clothing. I have been more than pleased. The best part of all, coming from Seattle, I had expected it to be twice as much. It is really affordable! Its a place like this that makes me think I am lazy and I should dry-clean just about everything.

Being the stylish interior decorator I am, haha, I made the foolish decision of painting my wall in Rock & Republics. The wonderful people at Bell Drapery were able to clean the "outrageous orange" from my jeans for $5.75. Ohsohappy!

I work in downtown central Phoenix and I've been going to Focaccia every morning for their french toast. It is delicious, and apparently addictive. Beware! The french toast comes with bacon or ham and a couple pieces of fruit for $5.25, which I consider a fair deal. I've also had their pizzas and they're very good as well.

I had dinner at Christopher's last night as a result of purchasing last week's Groupon. I thought the wait staff and ambience were top notch. The food, to be honest, left a little bit to be desired. Put simply, I thought it was overpriced (I'm not cheap, either). I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was an excellent piece of meat, but cooked rarer then I had asked for, which in my opinion, getting the order right shouldn't even be a consideration at $36. Moreover, it didn't come with any sides, so it was an additional $7 for some potatoes, although they were quite good, but should have just come with the entree. I'd like to visit Crush (although, it has looked dead the half-dozen times I've walked by).  In the end, I felt nickeled and dimed. Its meant to impress people, but I am not sure who I'd impress by taking them there. I may go back at some point, but there are just too many options nearby to justify a so-so $60 meal.

This is a review about how when dining at a restaurant customer service is as important as the food itself. A.L. and I are big fans of Groupon because as consumers it is a great way to learn about restaurants and new places, and it allows businesses to market themselves to a new demographic.   I had the chicken carbonara and a glass of Pinot. They were both good, but as A.L. mentioned when it came time to pay the bill, the owner gave us grief about using the card because "the fees cost too much." First of all, typical card fees are about .45 cents and 2-3%, so the fees for this charge were at most one dollar. What she was really upset about was not the paying with a card, but that we didn't spend substantially more than the $40 Groupon, and in her mind she wasn't able to recoup the $20 Groupon credit. That is why when we told her to run the bill for more the $5 she continued to tell us she was losing money. Although we were affronted by her comments, we just wanted to make her happy, pay our bill, and leave a tip. Despite what Old-Man-River-Roland says about cash the point is that the Groupon is meant for her to market her business, provide superior service, and hope for repeat customers. That is when they make their money!   I'm sure others have had fine dining experiences and it is very possible that the owners learned from their terrible mistake and have since changed their expectations for Groupon customers. You do not call out a first-time customer for paying with cash. EVER. I don't care how much the bill is or is not. No business should make a customer guilty for not having the $15 needed to pay the bill.

I like District compared to other restaurants nearby. I have eaten in the restaurant and in the bar area. Both have been pleasurable experiences with surprisingly good food and drinks, yet it is pricey. I like the ambience too. Overall, it has a good feel to it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5/5 is for the clientele/crowd. Being that it is a part of the Sheraton, there seem to be a lot of conference/business folks there. I wouldn't say this is a place to go if you wanted to be seen. Cheers.

Sens is sexy and fun. I love the NEW outdoor bar seating. It provides a nice dynamic setting for conversation. This evening, there was a DJ playing some solid tracks, including a dope seemingly remixed Beck song. The food was good too. I had the Sugar Cane and Lemongrass Chicken; I'd recommend both. I'd call their menu Asian fusion. I met some rad and good-humored fellow Yelpers too! I'll be back.

Z Pizza, oh, how I love thee! What can I say? Fresh ingredients. Good service. Not terribly expensive. If you're looking for a quick pizza fix look no further than Z.

Moira Sushi is an awesome sushi bar with excellent food, ambiance, and happy hour. My only complaint is that I wish they had more traditional items on the menu like chicken yakitori as well. However, they're are purists and there is something to be said for that too. I had the sunshine and rainbow rolls and they were delightful. During HH from 5-7pm, they offer a select list of rolls for $5-$6, which is a steal if you ask me. They're also a late night option serving food until 1:30am. I highly recommend!

I still think Moira is great, but we had some questionable service last night (drinks spilled all over us and charged for something we didn't order). I still highly recommend Moira. In my opinion, 5 stars should be reserved for the rare, yet continued, mind blowing dining experience.

I love Origins. Their products are FANTASTIC. I love just about every product I've ever purchased from Origins (the Blade Runner shaving cream was so-so, and in my mind didn't justify the expense). I can't speak for the women, but as a male its refreshing to have a full line of products at your disposal. I would highly recommend the Check and Balances face wash. For the guys, I'm a big fan of the charcoal body wash--it has such a refreshing masculine licorice smelly goodness. Believe me, women appreciate a guy who has good hygiene! I've only been to the Origins at the Biltmore Fashion Park once, but I had a wonderful experience with "Carrie." She was very helpful and introduce me to some new products I hadn't used before. She gave me lots of samples too, which really just puts me over the edge and keeps me coming back!

Local Breeze is a lovely little breakfast spot in central Phoenix and nice substitue to Matt's but without the long wait. The last time I was there I had the Coca Cola Ham and Cheese Omelette with potatoes. It was reeeeally good. The portions were very generous (I probably could have shared my plate). Although we ate inside, the patio area looks like an enjoyable mist experience. The next time I go I'm going to get the banana french toast, it sounds delightful!

Enough is enough with these anonymous and irrational condemnations of Alta Phoenix Lofts. Someone needs to set the story straight, so let that person be me. I have lived APL not once but twice! It is such a cool property and community that when I had the chance to move back in I jumped at the opportunity. The staff is excellent, attentive, and cordial. I've very much enjoyed getting to know Eddie, Amy, and Devon specifically. For those that say the staff is rude, maybe you should try being nicer.  Moreover, given the circumstances of inconsiderate guests (and sometimes residents) Mark Taylor does a wonderful job of keeping the grounds clean. I use the gym and pool daily and I've never been disappointed. I've lived in a 1-bedroom and a studio, and I've absolutely loved both. They have an urban chic feel that is unique and rare. I also really enjoy the art gallery and the events put on by the staff. The APL lounge on the second floor is great. Being so close to First Fridays is awesome. How about a block away from AMC 24 or a number of cool bars and restaurants? Sign me up.  Is APL more expensive other residences? Yes, and you get what you pay for, if your rent goes up it's because everybody wants to live there. It's called supply and demand. No one is trying to rip you off. Compare apples to apples, Monroe 44 is much more expensive and not nearly as authentic. For those that say the say it's loud, I would suggest living on the perimeter of the building away from the pool area. They do have security guards walking the premises nightly. I, personally, have never experienced obnoxiously loud behavior during late hours. Side note: the concrete walls seem to be great for noise insulation.  Are the one-star ratings warranted? Absolutely not. Those are people being vengeful for some perceived wrongdoing. It's not like you were not told about the valet service BEFORE you sign the contract. Living at APL is a luxury and you should expect to pay more for the amenities, that's how it works. APL is a fantastic place to live. The facility and community are as good as any in downtown PHX. I'm proud to be an APL resident and you will too. Period.

I wanted to follow-up my review of Alta now that the new management is in place. I can honestly say that Weidner has done a good job of maintaining the great energy of this community. They have been very accomodating and willing to help.

Tod Miller has "magic hands" and is well-versed in a variety of therapy and healing disciplines. In addition, he has an advanced understanding of nutrition and can apply this knowledge as necessary. Having competed in over a dozen Ironmans himself, Tod has the intuition, experience, and skill-set to heal athletic bodies, and non-athletes alike. Moreover, I, personally, have recieved deep-tissue and bodywalking, so I can say first hand that his services are very helpful, which is why I see him regularly. He is my mind, body, and soul LIFELINE.   For those who gave Beyond Massage Therapy 1-star, allow me to clarify a few things. If you knock on the store's doors and its locked during business hours it means that he is working with a client; the same can be said for the phone.This is a very common practice for masseuses who are sole-proprietors and do not have someone "manning" the reception area. Therefore, one should disregard the simplistic and narrow-minded 1-star reviews.

Yesterday I had a heavenly experience at Salon Embellish as a result of purchasing their Groupon a few weeks ago. Salon Embellish is a full service salon that offers massage, aesthetics, and hair care. The salon itself is small, but functional, with Aveda products and pictures spread throughout. I had a lovely 60-minute Swedish massage from Jeff and an awesome haircut by Charlotte. They both demonstrated attention to detail and I appreciated their efforts. I would recommend.
