My first impression was good. Liked that they do in house labs, very convenient. The NP was super nice. The lab tech was not the friendliest....but you can't win them all.

Very disappointed. Went in with a friend to get pedicures and they took us both back. They started right away on my friends nails, however I sat and sat and sat.....oh and I sat. With my feet soaking in hot water for about an hour before anyone even touched me. I was going to do the deluxe, after all it was my only lone outing in a long time since I have a baby, why not treat myself.. Nope.... I had to get the basic due to my friend being completely done. And we had already been there an hour. I had to go. The lady seemed super annoyed and never even said hello to me. The owner walked,around,very awkwardly....and did nothing as I sat there....I can't even believe I had to pay,for that. The same lady that did my toes,walked,up to my,friend and grabbed the toe separator out of,her toes with out any warning.. Just weird....and rude... Until next time....maybe I'll get a decent pedi

Highlights turned out grey.. Hard to tell what your hair looks like in the salon because it's dark... Got home and I was mortified at how much I paid to have grey hair... I'm 26! I called and the manager was not in... I left a message to be forwarded to her. She called back and basically told me there was nothing she could do. That all of the stylists are on their own. So it would be up to the girl who messed my hair up to fix it. Obviously I didn't want her touching my hair again! They refused to give me even a partial refund so I could go get it fixed elsewhere. I ended up dying it with a box color to cover the travesty. Ugh still mad about that mess! Never would go here again.

Awful food and service. We won't be returning. Not to mention over priced. You have to pay an extra dollar if you. Want fries with a sandwich and a 1.29 if you want mushrooms and another 1.29 if you want peppers on a Philly cheesesteak!

I got One chocolate and one maple... Won't be returning as I can usually guarantee my order will be messed up. Time to step up your game dunkin
