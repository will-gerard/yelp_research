Absolutely worst pet grooming and boarding place ever. We are currently away on vacation and arranged for our dog sitter to drop off our dog at this location after making a reservation through the main number. She called us at 4 am to make us aware that there was no reservation in the system. This is the second time this happened now. Unfortunately, Alex was working this morning and was a complete "bitch" - pun intended. We had to be woken from our vacation to be told she was rude and refused to let our dog board there. Our dog has been at banfield and just boarded at a different location last week but of course that didn't matter. She was adamant and not reasonable with my dog sitter at all. She was requiring her to fill out a new dog form with medical Information and vaccine information that she didn't have on her- despite us boarding last week. There was no empathy or compassion at all. She created a situation of stress and made things more difficult than they had to be. I do hope someone from pet smart corporation reads this and appropriately deals with this clearly disgruntled employee that does not take the customer into consideration at all.

Love the Jazz with the wine.... Definitely a laid back place in Old Town.  Both Jazz artists are great...and love the fact you can go on an off night everywhere else and just chill there.

Came here last night with the wife and friends.  Love the atmosphere.  They don't take reservations and a Friday night, so they quoted us an hour wait time.  It was definitely less than that and the great company made the time fly by in the outside bar area. The waiter was very nice.  He made a few mistakes with our orders, but nothing that ruined our meal.  I started with the pork chili....tender with a nice kick.  Next was the steak- great flavor.  I was supposed to have extra potatoes but they sent me extra brocolli...no complaints about that mistake as the meal overall was quite heavy.  All in all a nice evening and tasty meal.

Very laid back, great wine selection, great music and friendly staff. I just moved to this neighborhood and only went one time, but think this will be my new spot.

Hired George after reading reviews about him on YELP. I told him that as well and he was very appreciative. He arrived on time and was great. We bought a new home and he made the carpets look brand new. He did an amazing job and even threw in a small area for free.  We will definitely use him again and reccomend him to anyone looking for a carpet cleaner.

I have been meaning to write this review for a while.. Saw some reviews about Lyndell and his window cleaning service and hired them as we just moved to a house with many dirty windows. He did a very thorough and great job. He took his time to ensure everything was perfect. He is a young business-man and I am glad I supported his enterprise.

We live very close to this restaurant and decided to give it a try.  Granted it was the first week....but the service was terrible. The waitress seemed flustered and had too many tables.  In addition, my wife ordered a chopped salad and I swear it was the same salad you can buy in a bag at the supermarket.  My gnocchi was good..but not enough to save this place or review

A friend told me about the wine club they offer and I went in to check it out. What a great little place. Very cozy with a wine bar, couple of leather seats to relax and a few high top tables all within a great wine store. The wine club provides 2 bottles a month and tons of specials, including discount wine tasting every weekend.  It is great for someone wanting to learn more about wine and get into the hobby.  The owner is knowledgeable, friendly and not a wine-snob.  I feel very comfortable here and relaxed.....

I have been meaning to write a review about Davinci for some time now.  It seems like landscape companies in this town are a dime a dozen and it takes a few bad ones before you find the perfect fit.  We used yelp initially and picked AMS landscaping because of all if its 5 star reviews.  They were ok for a little while but started slacking off and our yard was not up to the standards we expected.  I saw one of Matt's Davinci trucks when I was filling up gas and gave him a call.  He immediately noticed all the issues with the types of plants on my yard and suboptimal locations inhibiting their growth and his knowledge in general surpassed any other company we have used.  His crew has been amazing at maintaining our yard...but most importantly, he is extremely accessible.  We are using him to update our side yard and used him to cut down a large tree- was done well,  was on-time and was affordable.  We have had numerous irrigation issues and he has had someone out immediately every single time to fix the issue on the spot.  He responds to emails within the half hour and I never worry.  It is nice to have such confidence in a company that does a great job.  I referred them to a colleague of mine who also used the previous yelp company and agrees that there is no comparison.  I am surprised they don't have more reviews...but than again, I don't want this secret to get out!!

I don't write many reviews, but feel when I write them that they are completely warranted.  We renovated our living room and what I was most interested in was setting up surround sound (and while setting it up in there, why not hook up the outside and great room!).  He came  over for the consultation with images and suggestions. Spent a while with us without being rushed or rushing us, explaining the process and scoping out the area.  He arrived with his guys that week and they do all their own work.  They are meticulous, knowledgeable and respectful and finished when they said they would!  They did all the construction and it looks amazing- very clean and fits in perfectly.  They suggested the speakers and receiver and they are amazing.  Scott than spent 2-3 hours giving us a tutorial so we can maximize our usage of our new system (Denon receiver, speakers, universal remote).  We had some glitches with the internet (not because of him) and he went above and beyond to figure it out and solve the problem.  More importantly, we have had a few blips here and there, again with our internet connection, and he has been immediately responsive (by e-mail and phone) and has come out to troubleshoot multiple times. His customer service is second to none and I don't think you would get the same with any AV company.  They love their job and are passionate about customer satisfaction.  I see them being very successful and will use them for sure when the next room needs anything AV related. Trust me...you won't go wrong.

Been there a few times.....great option for those living around Scottsdale/Shea. Have not had ANY issues with the service...in fact, my friend was given free coffee because he said he was cold!  LOTS of TVs....friendly staff and food was good.  I haven't tried much of the food, but the wings were good and that is typically a good barometer for me with sports bars.  Good drink specials and a nice space with outdoor patio area. Definitely NOT worth 1 star....

I have been here twice now- once for dinner and once for brunch.  I love the space- the outside is cozy, warm and inviting.  My wife and I had a drink at a small table by the bar with our own fireplace. It was very relaxing. We followed this with dinner on the patio. I had the ribs and they were surprisingly EXCELLENT.  They fell off the bone and were super tasty.  In addition, I have a dairy allergy and the waiter went the extra mile to ensure everything I had was dairy free. Brunch was also excellent.  I had the egg sandwich and it was also very tasty.  It is a great location, great atmosphere and I have had 2 great experiences.

Heard about this place from a friend and really wanted to try it out. To start out, the service was impeccable. I have a dairy allergy and Gina, our server, went above and beyond to accommodate me.  She even made my wife a special mocktail since she is pregnant.  The atmosphere is great- very comfortable.  The food was also excellent. We started with the chopped salad, which is the classic Cowboy Ciao chopped salad you could never go wrong with. I followed this with the chicken which was cooked to perfection with a risotto side.  My wife had the grilled cheese which she enjoyed (though not her favorite).  All in all, the five stars goes for the atmosphere, drink menu and service and good food....

I was the friend who dined with Andrew that ngiht he referred to in his review.  Went for some Chicken, placed our orders....had our apps and a glass of wine when it all went downhill.  The manager sat down next to us to break the news..."We are out of chicken!".  He offered us some non-poultry items and we both settled on the Filet. We never would have ordered the Filet, especially at a Chicken joint, but our hands were tied. We should have thought about ordering a burger from thier neighbor, The Grind.  The steak was okay but not what I was looking for. The manager assured us he would work this out on the bill. They got us a dessert and originally only the dessert was comped on the check. We called the manager over and he than took 20% off the bill.  He asked if we were okay with that, but we were not in the mood to haggle.  Truthfully, comping the entire meal would have been appropriate in that situation.  Huge dissapointment and not eager to try thier chicken anymore, especially if it tastes like beef!

Matt is extremely knowledgeable and great at what he does. He is great on both the selling and buying side of the trade. Strongly recommend

Second time here now and again top five meals of my life!!! I never review but felt the need.....have been to many well reviewed and noted restaurants (Gary da jo, nobu lanai, gramercy tavern, etc) and hands down one of the best meals of my life. All courses were amazing - the flavors, the atmosphere, the service. I hope Branden gets the recognition he deserves!
