Rhythm Room is all about the music. Great place to see national acts in an intimate setting on the cheap. Good sound system and perfect views from every place in the room. I think the furthest you can ever be from the stage while in the main room might be 30 feet. I'm not a beer drinker but don't always want to dive into a bottle of Grey Goose, so I like that they have Ace Pear Cider on tap. The bathroom is small but clean. My only complaint is the neighborhood - I'm always afraid I'll get jumped in the parking lot and am really surprised that my car hasn't been broken into there.

Two things you'll see at Merc Bar on weekends: near-elderly masters of the universe picking up on gold diggers, and The Real Housewives of Maricopa County. Fantastic people watching, really. I once watched a bottle of Cris delivered to a table of grandpas in an ice bucket with neon chaser lights swirling around the bottom, a beacon to the 20-something +2s who promptly flooded their table with silicone and Jennifer Lopez perfume.  The vibe is a lot different on weeknights. Less crowded, of course. A little more hip, a lot less Barcelona. My now-husband and I came here on our first date, sipping martinis at a low table in the lounge area and fell for each other, so Merc holds a special place in my heart. But even without that, the atmosphere is great, dark and mysterious, and every drink I've ever had there has been exceptionally well-made.

Extremely disappointed in this place... I brought my sister and a friend who were both in town from New York. Our waiter was full of inappropriate comments, starting with calling our male friend "Hugh" and asking if he was looking for a third girl now that Kendra had left. He later told my sister she looked like Caroline Kennedy, which is NOT a compliment. (Smart woman, very nice, but definitely not a looker. Kennedy, not my sister.) I appreciate friendly, cheerful service, but not ill-thought conversation.  We started our meals with salads. The house dressing has a distinctive fishy taste, despite being told there were no anchovies in it. There were wilted pieces of lettuce on my plate, and the walnuts were not chopped making it difficult to pick up with a fork at the same time as any of the wilted lettuce.  My entree was equally as disappointing. I ordered the lasagna, generally a safe choice on a maiden voyage at an Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, this time that was not the case. There were at least a dozen layers of lasagna noodles, making the dish very pasty. Between the layers there was barely any sauce, no discernable meat and zero cheese. I ate barely a quarter of it, yet now, three hours later, I still feel like there is a brick sitting in my stomach.  My sister ordered the veal parm, despite my story of being stared at by an adorable baby cow on the back of a dairy truck for ten miles in traffic one day. She soon regretted her choice as much as I regretted my lasagna. Mushy and bland, she also barely ate half her dish - and only a forkful of the greasy side dish of pasta served with it.  Our friend ordered a shrimp and pasta dish, which he found adequate. He was please that the shrimp were as large as they were and that there were a lot of them, but he still didn't feel the dish wowed him enough to pay $25 for it.  I finished with a dessert of a ricotta-based cheesecake with lemon curd topping. This too was adequate, as long as the filling and topping was eaten after being scraped off the mushy, bitter bottom layer (one could barely call it a crust).  We finished our meal at 8 PM on a Sunday night, and we were the only patrons in the establishment. That in itself told us a lot.  I know this place has been open since the '80s, but I'm not sure how. We won't be returning again.

Reminiscing about my dinner at Zinc Bistro makes me feel all melty, like slipping into a hot bath... Very decadent. I had the onion soup - it's remarkable how when onion soup is not loaded with salt it actually tastes oniony! Followed it up with the duck confit. I preferred the sliced duck rather than the crispy duck, but both were delicious, and the risotta was out of this world. Do I want the souffle? Yes please! We had the chocolate with Grand Marnier sauce, and the kitchen pre-divided it before baking so we each had our own perfect portion.  Two small complaints: 1. Despite having a reservation, our party was seated in the crappiest table in the house - the booth next to the kitchen door. We were promptly moved as soon as we requested it, but the worst table in the house should never be given to a (extremely polite) party with reservations. Save it for your rude, self-important, entitled Real Housewives of Maricopa County walk-ins. 2. The butter for the bread was rock hard. That's one of my biggest restaurant pet peeves, and it irritates me even more when it happens at a restaurant of this calibre. I need full and equal butter distribution on my bread. One giant hard chunk in the middle, or a wad of bread shredded by trying to spread icy butter, is a total buzzkill. It's the little things, guys.

I walked out of this place $30 lighter and wound up eating maybe $5 worth of the food. Just ugh. The Sesame Inn doesn't have lo mein on the menu - WTF kind of Chinese restaurant doesn't have lo mein? - but the hostess (I was ordering takeout) recommended chow mein instead. The noodles were spaghetti noodles, not Chinese noodles. The sesame chicken was nothing more than a fried, sliced chicken breast with some kind of watery soy sauce on the side to pour over the top, absolutely no chili paste or thick sticky sauce. Egg rolls were doughy and had little flavor. I've had way better meals from cheapy Chinese places in NY that charge $5 a plate. I can't believe I wasted $30 on this crap. It gets two stars instead of one because the restaurant itself, from what I saw, was clean, quiet and nicely lit and the staff was nice.  I don't understand why it is so freaking impossible to find good Chinese food in the Valley that's not from a chain like Pei Wei. In the last several years we've managed to get good pizza places here - can we import some East Coast Chinese? Of course, I realized last night that if I thought the last six or so Chinese places I've eaten at were terrible, maybe the problem isn't them, maybe I just don't like Chinese anymore!  Nah. It's totally them.

My husband and I discovered this place by accident, and what a happy accident it was! The food at Bella Luna is consistently great. The single time we ever had the slightest problem with service, the manager personally took over and waited our table for the rest of the night. The owners can often be seen sitting at a table near the door, nibbling, talking, having a glass of wine and making sure everything is running smoothly.   I love the fact that it is a locally-owned family business. Who wants to give their money to a corporation for mediocre food when you can give it to someone's Nana and Pop for a delicious, tastes-like-homemade meal of much higher quality?  In the mood for soup instead of salad with your meal? Ask if they have any of their homemade lentil in the pot. Absolutely delicious.  While I enjoy the warm, cosy atmosphere, some of the tables are a little too close together for my comfort. If you want to avoid the buzzkill of listening to your table neighbor's complaints over being 300% upside down on his Avondale home, you may want to visit on a weeknight when it's less crowded, rather than a busy Friday or Saturday.

After a terrible experience with another area vet, I switched my Mr Rileyface Pussycat Head III, Esq to Estrella for a kinder, gentler touch. Thankfully kitty has not had a medical emergency since we switched, but goes in regularly for shots, checkups, etc. The staff is friendly and professional, you don't have to wait weeks for an appointment and waiting room time before appointments is minimal. I wish my person doctor's office was this user friendly!  Because of kitty's health history he must eat special prescription food, and this office always has plenty of it in stock - unlike many other offices where you have to order it two weeks ahead of time. Trust me, if you saw my nearly 18-pound cat you'd know that waiting around for food is NOT an option.  Reserving the fifth star for something that really knocks my socks off, but until then, 4 stars sums up my kitty-friendly experience perfectly.

Mr. Puss got sick last month the day I had to leave town for a week for work. Estrella got me a rush appointment within 20 minutes of my initial call, took kitty in right away and carefully performed X-rays and blood tests. They sent me home with a bag full of meds (which my lucky pet sitter got to administer) and kept me up to date on test results via the phone. Once again I found them to be caring and responsive, and I will keep going back.

This is my husband and my favorite restaurant up here in Cave Creek. I think more than half the draw is the view. While I choose to live in the desert and love it, there is something distinctly calming - and cooling - about looking out over a vista of green. Watch long enough and you'll see javelina and possibly bobcats and mountain lions out on the gold course. The menu says it changes seasonally but I haven't really noticed a change in the last year. Not a huge selection of food but nicely edited - try the two pasta dishes, which are our favorites. Service from the waitstaff is great, but I took a star away for the hostesses. They're all like 16 years old, never, ever smile or make you feel welcome and have proven to be utterly unhelpful when asked even something as simple as how long the wait would be. We've also called ahead to reserve a specific table, told it wold be held for us & had this little blond cheerleader tell us too bad, so sad, not her problem. I always kind of steel myself for those initial couple of minutes, but once seated it's a wonderful experience. Just wish they would hire grownups to man the front.

First of all, they have an office cat. AN OFFICE CAT!!! Do you know what happens when I go someplace with an office cat? I want to visit that office every single day. But that would be weird. So I will just keep it to visits when Mr. Rileyface Pussycat Head III, Esq. needs it.   He had a gnarly ear infection and went for his very first visit with Dr. Tracy, who was very gentle and thoroughly explained everything that she was doing before she did it and all treatment options available. I greatly appreciated the option of giving the puss a single antibiotic shot for a few dollars more rather than attempting the violence-filled dance of trying to shove a pill down his throat daily.  The best part? The very next day Riley Face received a Get Well Soon card in the mail from Dr. Tracy. I die.

The hubs & I recently relocated to Cave Creek (yee haw!) and are lovin' life. This place is the perfect example of why.  A couple of weeks ago my British husband said to me, "I'm gonna have to check the bull riding schedule."  Pardon?  "Put on your cowboy boots."  Well you don't have to tell me twice.  Off we went on a Wednesday night to watch live bull riding and enjoy some cold drinks on the bleachers outside. They have pro and semi-pro riders, but anyone with some balls and the willingness to sign a (very thick) waiver is welcome to give it a whirl. I passed, and advised the hubs that he doesn't have enough life insurance to even begin to consider such an activity. But we sure enjoyed watching everybody else - especially the girl that stayed on longer than her boyfriend - and will absolutely, positively be back for more!  We didn't eat, but the drinks were cold, reasonably priced and delivered quickly by a cordial bartender. Love that it's just a couple of minutes away!

I crave this pizza. Get the thin crust and load it up with toppings. Not a fancy place but definitely friendly and very accommodating. I see couples in here on dates and entire extended families with grandpas and babies and everyone in between. The decor is dated, but you don't go for the upholstery, you go for the pizza which I am now wildly craving. BRB.

I've shopped at Basha's twice in my life. Both times I've wound up with nasty mold-covered produce. In the case of this location,  my (overpriced, BTW) strawberries were covered in green fuzz within 8 hours of purchase. I know this could happen anywhere - sometimes you just have bad luck and strawberries can go off pretty quickly - but twice from one store is too much for me. I'll stick with Frye's on Tatum & Cave Creek.

Here's what I want from a sandwich place: clean, generous but not obscene servings, friendly help. The Bad Donkey nailed all three. I picked up a Rueben and salad for the hubs and I to split for dinner, and it was plenty of food for the two of us. I arrived just a few minutes before closing and the staff was super-friendly and, most importantly, has not started breaking down the food prep area. I hate when places start doing that early and make you feel like a bother. My only complaint was that I waited a solid ten minutes  for my food and I was the only one in there. I'll be back to try some of their other menu items and see if the prep time gets any shorter.

I don't know why I've repeatedly gone back to this place over the years. The ambience is nice, and it's a cute place to bring out-of-town guests to wile away an afternoon. But the food is nothing to write home about -- Los Mesquites down the street is much better -- and far too expensive for quality that is comparable to what you can get at Filiberto's at 2 AM for 1/4 the price. Our last visit clinched my decision not to return when we had the most obnoxious waiter on earth. He spent the entire time he waited on us talking about how he was majorly hung over and explaining in detail how on his last shift he belittled his customers. The only thing more inappropriate would have been for him to compliment my boobs, which come to think of it would've probably been better. Oh, and by the way, one night I drove past here at around 10:00 before the front gate was shut and saw a bobcat moseying out the front door and across the street to Frontier Town - probably looking or a beer after chowing a duck.

I spent the months before my wedding bouncing between Hobby Lobby, Michael's and JoAnn Fabrics searching out supplies for my DIY projects. Hobby Lobby was usually my first go-to because it is closest to my house. Yes, their selection is huge, but often lacking in the items I wanted. The rubber stamps, ink and envelope options were skimpy. Closed on Sundays, which is very inconvenient. Corporate says it's so employees can have family time, which is a crock - it's nothing more than a cost-saving measure. I prefer Michael's.

I've frequented Olive & Ivy several times and always had a great experience, until the last time on Sunday night. Don't get me wrong, that experience was great in the moment too - until I got home and began projectile vomiting from the food poisoning I got from the seared scallops. On the plus side, I lost 4 pounds, so there's that. Two stars for previous good experiences, no stars for puking for 17 hours straight.

So first of all, they stop taking delivery orders at 5 PM every night. FIVE PEE EM. Ridic. I begrudgingly went in to pick up my order instead and when I asked the very nice teen girl behind the counter what backwards reasoning was behind this managerial decision, she said the owner had tried to make a delivery once & he got lost for two hours in the dark. Rather than invest in GPS, which he insists is wrong in Cave Creek (I've lived here for 3 years and never had a problem with my GPS, weird) he gives up a crapload of money in business because he won't deliver at night. So I get home with this pizza and frankly it was gross. The whole purpose behind thin crust is that it's crunchy. This was a soggy mess from edge to edge. Nasty. I would have given this one star but I threw in an extra for the nice girl behind the counter.

I specifically went to this location, even though Desert Ridge is much closer to my home, after looking up the availability of a book I want that the other location didn't have. The website said it was in stock, so off I went. When I arrived I attempted to find the book myself. Fail. I went to the info desk where four women (employees) were chit-chatting, and it took them a solid 45 seconds to realize I was even there, then one had to point me out to the woman who was actually supposed to be manning the booth for help. Despite the fact that their computer listed the book in stock, she too could not find it on the shelf. "It could be anywhere in the store," she said. Then just looked at me. Because she wasn't going to help me actually find it so her store could actually make money and afford to pay her. I asked her to check and see if it was on hold for someone else so I didn't waste any further time looking for it; she agreed then disappeared in the exact opposite direction of where the books on hold are kept. Two other women came over and repeated the exact same scenario. It was very bizarre and unhelpful, and they all made me feel as if I was wasting their time - I'm so sorry, I'm just a potential paying customer. The real kick in the pants is that Amazon has it $5 cheaper including shipping, but I just wanted it today. I wasted that $5 in gas easily. Short story: Very unhelpful staff, not interested in making a sale. Will not return.

Beautifully appointed bar with one of the best views in the Valley, rivaling the Wrigley Mansion. The drinks are large and potent - nothing watered down here. Keep that in mind when you see the drink prices. You're paying for a lot more liquor! Good service and always an interesting crowd, including but certainly not limited to guests of the Sanctuary Resort. An impressive place to bring a date that's off the beaten Scottsdale path. Although I live in Phoenix, I stay at Sanctuary at least once a year for a business event with three dozen others, and we rarely venture off-property for drinks during that week because we enjoy Jade Bar so much.

I recently moved 45 minutes away from my old stylist, and since I want to immerse myself into this new part of town as much as possible I decided to skip the hike and find a new tress dresser. Icon is in the same shopping plaza as the Most Beautiful Target in the World and having read the great reviews, I decided to give it a shot after noticing that my ends were drier than a popcorn toot. I was thrilled when the owner herself cut my hair!  This woman tamed my choppy, uneven, hadn't-been-trimmed-in-a-shameful-amount-of-time tresses and whipped them into something worthy of Kate Beckinsale, without sacrificing length. Having straight hair, I've never been tempted to go somewhere for a blowout before but find myself seriously considering it for the beautiful silky styling she did. (Hair dryer/round brush coordination is not my forte.) She even complimented my haircolor-from-a-box and didn't try to upsell me on her own coloring services, although I will definitely use her if I decide to get highlights or go lighter.  The salon itself is super clean and does not have that gross chemical smell that many places do. It looked like they were using Aveda and Prive products exclusively.  Pricing was on par with a high quality salon in Scottsdale. I wound up spending $90 for a cut and style, tip and a bottle of product that I LOVE (which I believe added $25-$30 to the total) - plan on around $65 for a cut with tip and no product.  I will definitely be back!

I've been practicing yoga for ten years and thought I'd give Bikram a shot as a new challenge. I chose Bikram Yoga Avondale simply because it was the closest studio to me. Shelby and John run a wonderful studio - the atmosphere is friendly, calm and supportive, and the instructors are extremely knowledgeable. The studio itself is pretty stinky, but that's true of any Bikram studio because of the heat and sweat. The studio room is very large with plenty of room for about 2 dozen practitioners, all of whom are super nice.  I kept it up for two months until A) I got bored and B) my travel schedule heated up again. That has nothing to do with this studio at all, of course. The boredom came from the class being exactly the same, down to the script spoken by the instructors, every single class. Again, not a studio issue; this is one of the rules of Bikram.  But if you have a longer attention span and less crazy schedule than I and you live in the SW Valley, give Bikram Yoga Avondale a shot. Your first class you'll feel like you're dying. Your second class you'll feel like you're flying.

I was stoked when this place opened. Yay! Sushi without driving 20 minutes to another town!  My enthusiasm was short-lived. Quite frankly, the quality is spotty. Sometimes the sushi is great. Sometimes it blows. You never know which you're going to get until you're already eating it, and by then it's too late. On my first visit I asked the bartender for a mai-tai and he didn't know how to make it. That's a pretty typical sushi bar drink, right?  I would often pop in alone and sit at the sushi bar, where the waitresses tend to forget you're alive. I've ordered drinks and edamame and been served and eaten my sushi before either of the aforementioned even arrived.  I totally avoid the tepanyaki tables. Why would I pay upwards of $30 a person for what's essentially friend rice?   After three mediocre experiences in a row, I've given up.

I'm hoping that someone at the Health Department reads this and is as alarmed as I am about what I witnessed at BluBurger last night.  I was sitting at the bar and ordered a cheeseburger with no add-ons - so no lettuce, tomato, any of that jazz. Literally within three minutes of placing my order the bartender put a plate in front of me. Surprised by the speed but not thinking much of it I ate a couple of sweet potato fries, then noticed that "my" burger was awfully dressed up. I lifted the bun up with fingers I just wiped my runny nose with (I know, I'm totally gross but I thought it was my food) and saw that it was not what I ordered. At the very same time the bartender came hurrying back, saying she accidentally gave me someone else's order.  As she whisked it away I explained that she'd have to make it over again because I already touched it and I have a cold. She kind of laughed and brought the plate back to the kitchen window. I watched while the cook did nothing more than put the big toothpick back into to bun and sent the contaminated plate out to the unsuspecting diner.  I don't know if the bartender didn't tell the cook what I said about already touching it and having a cold, or if neither of them cared. What I do know, however, is that is really, really gross, and if I knew that I was eating someone else's snot germs I'd barf.  So if you ate at BluBurger last night and you develop a cold this weekend, now you know why.

At the end of last year, my skin was a disaster. Between the daily heavy makeup necessitated by my job, travel and stress, my jawline was ready to revolt and was actually quite revolting to look at.  Enter Blu Sol and, more specifically, Tiffany.  She saved my skin. There's no two ways about it. Between her soothing touch and the organic products, my face has never looked better. Fair warning, girlfriend takes no prisoners with the extractions. She will squeeze every last bit of gunk out of your pores, so take an aspirin before arrival if you're pain-sensitive.  Front desk staff is lovely, warm and friendly. They always offer that delicious fruity water and lead you into the relaxation room before your treatment. The phone call reminding you of your appointment the day before is a nice touch, too. Well worth the price - do the monthly auto renew.

I was bummed that we didn't like this place more. Hubby and I had lunch there today and the food was really mediocre for the price. We both had kobe beef burgers, and while they were cooked to order (mine medium-rare and his well) they were pretty flavorless. The fires were cold by the time they reached us -- it took a solid 20 minutes to get our food. The milkshake from a machine was actually really good, though. I'm intrigued by street tacos mentioned by someone below and might stop in again to check those out when I see them advertised, but other than that we'll skip it.

You have no idea how happy I was when this place opened - and turned out to be good! I was really tired of driving into Scottsdale to get my hair cut. I lucked out when I booked an appointment and by luck of the draw wound up being styled by Maira. She's great at what she does, sweet as can be, and always remembers little details of my life that even I forgot I told her!  I really like that they don't even try to push product on you, unlike many other salons, and they give you a mini-massage before your shampoo.  I took a star away because of a bad experience I had with one of their aestheticians about 2 years ago. She put Retinol on my eyelids, which is a no-no. Lots of itching and pain for a few days afterwards. She also made like she was giving me a product for free, but wound up charging me for it. Like I said, that was 2 years ago and I don't think that aesthetician is still working there, but I haven't gone in for anything other than a haircut since. If you want a facial, Blu-Sol is just a couple of doors down.  A shampoo, cut and style runs me $32 plus tip. Much better than driving to Scottsdale and paying twice as much for the same service!

Cartwright's is the quintessential Cave Creek restaurant: rustic-meets-upscale. The decor is dark, intimate and quiet, exactly how I think a restaurant should be (I hatehatehate loud restaurants!). The wine list is extensive, and the service the hubs and I received was absolutely impeccable. Why only two stars, then? Because in a dining establishment the food should take precedence over all else, and frankly it was merely meh.  Hubs and I both had steaks and they were truly bland. They weren't particularly tender or flavorful. The side of Bernaise was nice, but available at other less pricey places. Frankly we make better steaks from Safeway at home on the grill for about 1/4 of the price. We left full, yet still dissatisfied - and with out wallets that much lighter we should have been kissing the chef's feet.  We don't mind spending over $100 on great meals, and do so regularly. But we actually expect a great meal for that money, not a mediocre one. We'll try someplace else next time.

Cartwright's has redeemed itself! The hubs & I decided to give it another go after none of our usual Cave Creek/Carefree haunts held our interests that night. Unlike last time we avoided the steaks, but the hubs had fish & I had the prime rib. Everything was excellent. The service, which was never the issue in the first place, was absolutely top notch, and the waiter brought me several samples of wine when I couldn't decide which I wanted. Tip: This is a great way to get the equivalent of a free glass of wine ; )  Speaking of wine, they have wine tasting classes several times a month. We'll be adding this back into our restaurant rotation.

There are a remarkable number of indie coffeehouses in Cave Creek/Carefree for such a small area, but Janey's is hands down my absolute favorite. The coffee is superb - beans are supplied by The Roastery of Cave Creek - and always hand-crafted perfectly to your specifications. The food is delish, always fresh and made when you order, not before. They have a lovely, well-edited wine selection, including a Riesling I was pleasantly surprised to also see offered at Zinc Bistro, and some great beer on tap. Stop by Thursday nights for local music, or weekend mornings to enjoy chats with the locals around the outdoor fire (in the winter, of course!).  It is important to me to spend my money in locally-owned, family-operated business whenever possible, and that's another reason why I love this place. It is truly a family labor of love - all of them work here, and you'll see them all circle through if you sit there long enough. You're apt to be there all day if you sink into one of the overstuffed leather armchairs... Free wifi so you can work if you're so inclined.  The highlight of Janey's, other than the great coffee, food and bar, are their two affable Afghan hounds, Moses and Ghandi. While some people come by just to play with the dogs, I suggest you at least enjoy a cup of coffee while you do so : ) Bring your own pooch too - Janey's patio is a great doggy hangout!  Yoga Breeze was doing a full moon yoga session on the patio in warmer weather, and hopefully that will resume when this Arctic freeze we're experiencing ends.  And by the way, if you can't handle a little dust on your car a la the dude from Glendale below, you probably shouldn't be coming to Cave Creek. But I think if dirt parking lots don't bother the owners of the multi-million dollar homes in town with vehicles to match, you could probably let it slide, too. If not, there's a $5 car wash up the road.

As a longtime customer of Blu Sol Tolleson, I was thrilled when they opened their Scottsdale location in Papago Plaza since it is more convenient for me. Frankly I'd follow Tiffany to Kabul if necessary, that's how much of a difference she has made to my skin.   The facilities are lovely, although I'm not sure they have a "relaxation Room" - i.e. quiet waiting room - here like they do in Tolleson because the 2 times I've been to this one I've arrived on the dot. What they do have that Tolleson doesn't is this crazy bathtub room. I haven't tried it out yet, but since my large Roman tub at home doesn't have jets I'll probably give it a whirl this winter. Hahaha get it? Give it a "whirl'? Oh, I crack myself up.  The rest of the staff is wonderful too, and welcome constructive feedback on services and products. The last time I was in I spoke with a woman I believe is the owner about the Tasha & Co. products they sell -- I'm totally hooked but I dislike the packaging. She said she would get in touch with Tasha & Co to discuss. Who does that? If you told your Walgreen's manager you didn't like the fact that you can't squeeze enough toothpaste out of the tube do you think he'd call Colgate Palmolive? No. Just an example of how Blu Sol really cares about their clients.   Let's face it: A spa membership is a splurge, not a necessity, regardless of your economic status. If you're going to spend the money, do it somewhere like this that is really going to take care of you.

I've been coming here since the fall and can't say enough good things about it. I've been to many gyms and done all sorts of classes from Pilates to Bikram yoga and nothing has transformed my body the way re-Barre has. The instructors are all wonderful - of course I have my personal favorites but honestly they are all great - and they mix things up enough to keep it interesting. It is easily the single most supportive fitness environment I've ever been a part of. Well worth the membership cost for that alone.
