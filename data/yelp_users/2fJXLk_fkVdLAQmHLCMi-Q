We have been going to Paradise for a while now.  I decided to telecommute from there today and I have to say I am not happy.  Lets get the food out of the way.  The food is and has always been amazing.  There is not one thing I can bad about this place when it comes to their food.  Today i found a seat near a power outlet and fired up my laptop.  I found out that they have free wifi that is filtered.  They will block any site they deem not family friendly.  Ok so I get the reason why but come on..  The item that pushed me over the edge today was when an employee decided to open the blinds on all the windows.  The area was a nicely shaded and was not too bright and not too dark.  When she opened the blinds, blinding light hit my eyes and as I struggled to adjust to the brightness the employee walked by and scowled at me for making a funny face...I couldnt see give me a break.  Sorry for the rant there, in other words I recommend getting the food to go.

We finally got a chance to eat at Flavors of Louisiana.  We both decided to get the Shrimp PoBoy.  I was really impressed with the flavor.  The shrimp were cooked to perfection.  I would have liked to try other items on the menu but that will have to be another time.  The decor is pretty basic but the food speaks for it self.  If you are looking for some great creole food I recommend hitting up Flavors of Louisiana.

We were craving some good pizza so we hopped on yelp to find a place around us.  We called in our order and I went in and picked it up.  They looked crazy busy and I was glad we called the order in.  The pizza was amazing!  We both agreed that it was one of the best pizzas we have had in a long time.  We will be ordering from here again.

We decided to have our Valentines Day Dinner here at Tiburon.  I called ahead and they were taking reservations for Valentines Day.  When we arrived the hostess asked us to take a seat in the lounge and they would let us know when our table was ready.  I ordered a drink from the bar and and an Iced Tea for my wife.  When I asked the Bartender for a straw I was informed that they do not provide straws as they endanger animals.  I thought that it was odd but ignored it.  20 Minutes later our table was ready.  Our table was right in front of the tank.  I thought the tank would be bigger than it was and I was a little disappointed at the fish in the tank.  There was a few sharks but they were all pretty small.  When I had made reservations I was told they would have a special Valentines Day menu.  Our waiter did not offer this menu to us at all.  We ordered the Duck Tacos for our Appetizer.  They took a while to arrive.  They were decent but not spectacular.  The decor was nice but my wife and my self both agreed that they were trying to make it a fancy restaurant but failed on many levels.  1.  The table cloth was not cloth but vinyl.  2nd the napkins were actually paper napkins folded to give the illusion of cloth.  Our waiter helped us choose our meal and was very honest about what was good and what was not.  When the food arrived it looked good.  I had the mahi mahi and felt that it was a little bland.   Over all I was disappointed with our experience and felt I had to apologize to my wife for a mediocre meal.  She felt it was a nice restaurant that just needed a few things to make it better.  She made the point that they do not provide straws because it endangers animals yet they serve seafood in front of fish?

I found out about tangs by just driving by.  I checked the other reviews on yelp and figured we would give it a try.  I called the order in for "Wok Out", the person on the phone was very pleasant.  The portions were a nice size.  I like the option of having white or brown rice as well as fried rice for a 1$ more.  I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and my wife ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken.  The General Tso's was not as spicy as I would have liked but it was delicious. The sweet and sour was good as well.  We were both surprised at the amount of Pineapple as most restaurants only give you 1 or 2 pieces.   I also ordered fried rice and I have to say it was some of the best fried rice i have had.  It was not greasy at all like other places.  We also ordered a cup of the Egg Drop soup.  It was full of egg which is a surprise compared to other restaurants I have gone to.  Overall we were very pleased with our food and will be returning to Tangs!

The wife and I hit up Smashburger yesterday.  When we walked in the interior is pretty much what I expected.  It was nice but nothing that stands out.  We ordered our food, the wife had the regular cheeseburger and I ordered the Arizona Burger.  The food came pretty quick and the orders were correct.  The first bite I had I was hooked.  The burger was seared and juicy.  We both agreed that we would be coming back.

I called Eric to ask questions about coating my garage floor. He took the time to explain the entire process as well as the different coverings that they offer. I called him back a few weeks later to get my new garage floor coated. We set up a time and a date and his guys where at my house on time and ready to work. They knocked out the first coat in just a short amount of time. Eric came back and applied the final coat after the first coat dried. The attention to detail that he provided and the quality of his work is amazing. I am so happy with my garage and would recommend Eric and First Class Coatings to anyone looking to get their garage floor done. I could not have asked for a better company and quality product.

Called Bulwark after reading reviews on Yelp. We found a scorpion in the house and my wife freaked! They were able to come out the very next day. Our technician was Quincy. He was on time and explained everything they were going to treat and what to expect. I am very happy with the service!

I called Arizona Pest Squad after we noticed a cockroach in our house.  David answered the phone and was able to get us an appointment that worked with my schedule within a couple of days.  He showed up and applied the treatments to the inside and outside of the house.  He clearly explained what he was using and what the application requirements are.  He stated that they will need to come back in 7 to 10 days to do a follow up treatment per the manufacturers recommendation.  I am very happy with the service they provided and will be using them in the future!
