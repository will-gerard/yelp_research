El Charro is a family tradition and will continue to be. I've told my loved ones that if I am ever to a point where I have to order my last meal ever, it will be a cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa from El Charro. I could then die happily. And make sure Colette is my waitress.   Love this restaurant and always will.

A new favorite of mine!  We went to San Tan Flats last Saturday with some of our children and grandchildren.  Our kids told us that the best place to sit was outside but that it got really busy and it might be hard to find seating.  With that in mind, my husband and I went over at 3:00 p.m. to scope out a couple of tables, since they don't take reservations, at least not for the outside tables.  I had told our kids to join us at 4:00 p.m.  We really didn't need to get there that early.  I think that we would have been able to find adequate seating if we had all arrived at 4:00 p.m.  However, we enjoyed listening to the music and being out in the beautiful weather that we have been having.  When the kids and grandkids appeared, the grandkids were loving every minute.  They danced on the dance floor, ran around and had a blast.  The food we ordered was excellent, prepared promptly and there was a lot of it:)    Following dinner the kids roasted marshmallows over our campfire and were in heaven.  We certainly enjoyed every minute that we were there and I can see why this place is so popular.  I want to go again!

I have been an Outback fan for years and my husband, parents, children and I have made a habit of coming to this particular Outback a couple of times a month.  This past year our visits have decreased as we have seen changes taking place that have not been favorable.  However, we were still coming at least once a month and would anticipate at least an average,  mediocre experience.  Unfortunately, we will not be returning due to our latest visit.  Upon arrival we were seated and our waiter came over to our table.  I believe he said his name was Larry and he had more the demeanor of a used car salesman than a waiter.  After he introduced himself, he disappeared.  Seriously, he was gone for more than 15 minutes.  We had menus, but no water, no bread, no attention whatsoever.  He walked past us a couple of times and we attempted to catch his eye.  The third time past our table and more than 15 minutes after we were seated we flagged him down and requested water and bread and said we were ready to order our dinner.  He told us he would be right on it.  Several minutes later we received water but it was served by a bus boy and we still had no bread and no one to take our order.  At this point I told my husband that I wasn't liking our waiter and the lack of service that we were receiving.  We talked about leaving and decided to suck it up and stay.  A full 10 minutes after receiving the water, our waiter brought out bread and was ready to take our order.  Mind you, we had been seated there for a half hour by then and only had water and menus in our hand to show for it.  I ordered potato soup and a dinner salad.  My husband ordered a filet, medium rare.  During another trip past our table, following placing our order for dinner, our waiter was caring a tray with two soft drinks on it.  We thought that maybe these were the soft drinks that we had ordered.  They weren't meant for us but we were given them nonetheless.  They were both spilled all over us as our waiter was passing by.  Seriously, ALL over us.  I had Coke in my hair.  Every time I blinked more Coke ran into my eyes.  My blouse was covered in soda, as were my pants, my husband's pants and our shoes.    Now, I know accidents happen.  But there was no apology for his collision!  He left us with our one little paper napkin each to try and dry ourselves.  He then went to the table next to us and told them he was sorry, that he would be back in a little while with new drinks for them!  Are you kidding me?  I was soaked and my husband was wet.  We were heading to a movie following dinner, but there was no way that we could go any place without changing.  Our drinks never came. The dinner was sub-par and the only good thing about this incident is that it gives us a great story to tell when people are talking about their WORST restaurant experiences.  To top it off, a female manager did come over to see the damage.  After she asked how we were I told her that I wasn't doing very well and that I, as she could see, was drenched.  She said "Sorry" and left, never to be seen again.    Frankly, I thought that our bill would be adjusted somewhat, at least enough to cover the dry cleaning bill.  But not a chance.  We paid the bill and promised each other that we would never return again, either by ourselves or bringing our family.  Terrible, terrible service!  Wish I could give ZERO stars.

I have been coming to Greenfield Nails and Spa since they opened under the current management.  The service and work has always been the highest quality and I've brought friends and family here to be treated to a wonderful experience as well.        Last Monday morning at 9:00 a.m. I went in, without an appointment, and thought I would just take a chance on getting a gel mani and pedicure done in the hour and 15 minute time period that I had available.  Since this is a very popular salon, it is usually best to have an appointment, but I knew from experience that Monday morning is less busy than some other days or in the afternoon.  Wow!  Talk about service!  I was given two wonderful nail techs who worked on my mani and pedi simultaneously and I was out of there in one hour and five minutes.  Perfection!      There are other times when I enjoy a less hurried pace, and I am always pampered and well cared for.  I have a favorite gel color that I always request, #15 Pedal Faster Suzi.  Everybody in the salon remembers that it is "my color" and the fact that they have taken the effort to know what I want really impresses me.      Everybody is extremely friendly and they call me by name, which is a big plus in my book.  If I could afford it, I would be in here nearly every day, just because the process is relaxing and fun.  As it is, I am in here at least every two weeks.  Yes, my nails last longer than two weeks.  However, i come in just for a little pampering and "me" time, and I always feel like I got more than my money's worth.      Love this salon!

Good food at a good price. We always like Someburros.   Sure, it isn't very authentic. It is typical "Americanized" Mexican food, but it is tasty, the restaurant is very clean and the staff is always polite and helpful.

I had gone to this dry cleaners for seven years, mostly because it is close to my home.  However, I will not be returning.  For the third time, our clothing was "lost".  As was explained to me, before I went in to pick up my husband's clothing at 5:30 p.m., one of the girls in the front had sent it home with another customer.  The clothing wasn't "ready" until 5:00 p.m.  I suggested that they look through the receipts that they had from 5:00 to 5:30 to see who might have our clothing, which included a tuxedo shirt and other white shirts that my husband needed the next morning.  I was told that they did not keep receipts, so they could not look that up.  In addition, both girls blamed each other for the mess-up.  This was the third and final time that I am going to put up with this.  The first time that our clothing was lost, it was never found.  I put in a claim and was given $5.00 whole dollars in future dry cleaning credit.  This is after I had paid $11.00 for the dry cleaning of these clothing items.  No reimbursement for the cleaning fee that I paid and no reimbursement for the value of the clothing lost.  The manager said he could not reimburse for the clothing they lost if I didn't have original sales receipts from the purchase of those items and proof that the items on the sales receipt (assuming a person kept it) were the exact items dropped off to them.  Sap that I was, I continued to go to this cleaners.  The second time, my husband's shirts were lost, including a tuxedo shirt that was needed for a concert the next evening.  We ended up having to buy another tuxedo shirt.  Four weeks later I received a phone call saying our shirts had been found.  There wasn't even a dry cleaning credit given this time for the foul up that they were responsible for.  But at least we did get this batch of clothing back, eventually.  The third time was the final straw.  Never, never, never again am I going to this cleaners. This is the first time in my 55 years that I have ever written a complaint, online or otherwise.  If there was a way to give zero stars, that is what I would give.
