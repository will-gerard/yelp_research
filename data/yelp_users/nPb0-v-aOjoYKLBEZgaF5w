I read the reviews before I went so ordered the California Roll, Thai Steak Salad and Hot Fudge Sundae (not on the menu) and was blown away with each item!   I probably could take it down one star because the service was a little strange, but ultimately, its about the food.  I can't wait to go back and just have a steak...which I never order when I go out, but the steak in this salad was so good, I want to have the whole thing!

I've stayed away from this place because of the reviews, but its right down the street and my Mother wanted to go.  It was Easter Sunday, 1 PM,  so, it wasn't crowded at all.  2 of us had the Jumbo Bairdi Crab Boil and it was absolutely fantastic...meaty and sweet.  Mom had the Jumbo Fried Shrimp plate and took half of it home...just great.   Perhaps, it was because it wasn't that crowded that everything was fresh and service friendly and timely.  I would not hesitate to go back! I didn't rate it as a 5 because "As good as it gets" only comes fresh out of the ocean...this was as close as you're going to get in Phoenix.

I'm on Jury duty and when I saw this old Phoenix landmark, I thought, great.   What a huge disappointment.  I had the number 2 special which included chop suey which was 99% bean sprouts, egg roll- again 99% bean sprouts, 2 fried shrimp- 99% breading and fried rice which was ok. On the plus side, the service and server were prompt and pleasant.

Wasn't looking for this, but so glad we found it.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items.  Two f us shared the Smoked Gouda and bacon Brizza...breakfast pizza.  I had the bacon infused Bloody Mary.  Yummy!  You order at the register and the bring it to your table...quickly!

So glad this place is just down the street! For my first trip I stuck with the basics... Martini - at $10 a bit pricy but well made! Shrimp Spring Rolls - the house Red Thai sauce was fantastic Tofu and Chicken Pad Thai - truly the best I have ever had. Now I can't wait to work my way down the menu!

Was looking for Lobby's but Johnny's has moved in that spot.  The Italian Beef with hot peppers was fantastic.
