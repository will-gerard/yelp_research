I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place! I have been here a handful of times and each time it has been consistently good. My favorite item is the 24 K curry, which is a spicy green curry that features some delicious veggies (japanese eggplant that is melt in your mouth (probably the best eggplant I've ever had... I don't typically like eggplant), squash, and green beans). I usually add chicken and have more than enough food for two meals. Wild Thaiger has decent specials on some nights of the week for drinks (Mondays feature 5$ martinis). My only complaint about the Thaiger is that, unlike other Thai restaurants, they do not allow you to choose your spiciness level. I understand that some dishes may be better spicy or mild, but I would like to have the option available. I would say that Wild Thaiger is the best Thai food I have had in the downtown area and would recommend it.

I (finally) tried Comedor Guadalajara with a friend in from out of town last weekend. I was surprised by how busy they were on a Sunday at lunch time- there were people crowded in front of the restaurant and they announced names over an intercom. Whoa. We were seated fairly quickly in the (extremely large) dining room and service was efficient from that point on. The chips and salsa were more like chips and hot sauce, but they tasted good... I love the spiciness of the sauce and put it on everything. When it came to ordering, we were a little disappointed. My friend is a vegetarian and thought Mexican food would be no problem, but our waitress didn't know of almost anything on the menu that was vegetarian (most items have lard). He ended up getting cheese enchiladas and thought they were pretty 'meh.' Here's the real kicker though, I got the chicken burrito, which was absolutely delicious.... the chicken was juicy and cooked well... but the burrito mainly consisted of fantastic and flavorful grilled veggies...the type that would be perfect for a vegetarian perhaps.... hmmm. Anyway, other than that mishap, I really enjoyed my burrito and would go back to get it again.    PS prices were reasonable, especially at lunch, and the portions were large.

I have been to Phoenix Theatre a couple times to see shows in the large theatre. We went last weekend to their grand reopening, and we got to be the first people to sit in the new seats...woo! The seats are comfy, there really isn't a bad seat in the house to see or hear the show. Last year, the BF and I saw Spamalot and it was good...not the best performance ever, but good. Last weekend we saw Rent, and it was great! The cast was very talented and spot on except one character who I won't name as to not hurt his feelings, but man, they really made a mistake in casting with this one individual. Anyway, this theatre is definitely worthwhile and I would recommend it to everyone!

Oh family.... why must you continually want to patronize boring chain restaurants. I've been to this OSF many times, and it is always fine... nothing special, but nothing terrible. I usually get angel hair with mizithra and clam sauce. The bread and butter is tasty. The minestrone soup is generally a little watery, but fine. By the time the pasta gets there, does anyone really want to eat any of it? I usually take it home. Anyway, OSF isn't the worst chain out there, but I'd rather spend my money on a meal at a local restaurant, especially when in downtown Phoenix.... mecca of local eats. Sorry OSF.

Ok, so I don't know how adequately I can review this place, as I only went in to the bar to get some drinks and then sat outside while waiting to go get some pizza, BUT I will try. I went in to the bar last night and ordered a beer and a glass of riesling from Germany. The bottle of riesling was almost empty, so the bar tender just poured the rest in my glass, resulting in a very full glass of wine and a very happy me. The wine was very very good, however I forgot to note what type of wine it was! How dumb of me. So this place was really good, it was convenient, generous, and looked cute inside. The bar tender was nice enough, and I like sitting outside, especially when it's a little cool out. I didn't try the food, but I'd like to one of these days... I wish they put their menu or wine list on the website. Overall, I'd recommend this bar even if you weren't waiting in line at Bianco.     PS: if anyone knows what the name of their german riesling is, I would probably love you forever.

Man, the science center has gone downhill! I went last night when waiting to eat at bianco. We saw body world, which was cool, but the rest of the center was pretty empty in comparison to how I remember it from about 5 years ago when I last went. First of all, this place is expensive! and I do not know why cuz they've had the same exhibits for years and years and the exhibits seem to be more stripped down than they used to be. I mean really? an exhibit on building a house? How much more boring can an exhibit be? The Body world was cool, but it didn't have the really cool body with the horse... I wish they had had that. Also, it cost extra on top of the science center fee and you can't JUST buy the Body worlds.... I thought that was lame. Overall, maybe kids will still like this place, but I found it to be severely lacking, for as much as they charge they need to get some new exhibits or new materials in their exhibits.

I went to Rosita's place for the first time to celebrate national tequila day, most excellent! I have never noticed this restaurant, let alone eaten here before. The restaurant is a bit odd, with the waitresses wearing little costumes (I am surprised this is still a thing anywhere). The food, however was pretty tasty. I tried the horchata with booze... very sweet and delicious. Their margs are fairly standard, but large. For food, I had their wonderfully delicious cheese crisp (and trust me, I've had some bad cheese crisps elsewhere, it is possible) and a combo which included a taco and an enchilada. The taco was nothing special, but the enchiladas were tasty and had a nice spicy sauce on top. Portions were large and prices were small, can't complain about that. My friend got the carnitas burrito, which she didn't really love ( I didn't try it, so I can't really comment). I would definitely return here.

I've been to La Tolteca a couple of times with Voice daily deals. Let me start by saying this place is not fancy, it feels like a restaurant straight out of Mexico, which is a good thing. This place has definite high points and low points. La Tolteca has very good cheese and beef tamales....the cheese tamales are very spicy and the beef is well seasoned and delicious and they both only cost 2$ each. They also have a really good salsa bar with delicious salsa verde. There are other things that are less awesome such as the carnita sopes, which don't have the same flavorful seasoning as the other items mentioned. The strawberry tamales are really odd....not bad, but odd. They're sweet, but not sweet enough to qualify as dessert. Also, their carne asada burritos are pretty par. I would recommend coming here and stocking up on cheese and beef tamales and reveling in deliciousness.

This place is so cute! I went here on Saturday night at about 8:30 or so. I ordered the chicken sammich with cheese, bacon, and gravy and the BF got a grilled cheese with bacon. We sat outside and it was lovely! I started with a hurricane, and let me tell you...it was ridic good! One of the best hurricanes I have ever tasted (definitely look for the nights when they have specials on the drinks on FB....it's worth it).  Anyway, the food came out and not only was my sammich HUGE, but it was in a pool of gravy.... I didn't even know how to begin eating it. I went with the messy method and picked this giant sammich up. Mmmm. The chicken was fresh and juicy, the gravy was rich and tasty and the bacon was flavorful. This was not a light dinner, but it was totally delicious. The BF said his grilled cheese was good, but he wished it was on regular bread instead of a biscuit. I really like that this place uses local ingredients. I will definitely be back in the near future (I really want to try a burger....yummmm).

This is a long overdue update. I don't think it gets much better than the Welcome diner. This place is legit delicious, I would struggle to find a meal I have had here that was sub par.... And I've been here many times (more than my check ins reflect). I try to bring people here as often as possible, family, friends... Because it is just that good. My favorite time to come is brunch..... One of the guys who works behind the counter gave me official credit for ordering the sunrise sandwich with egg over medium add tomato confit.... Add the confit... You will not be sorry. This thing is better than the lux egg sandwich (and if you know me, you know that's a big deal). The egg is always cooked perfectly, the biscuits are always buttery, flaky, and wonderful. The sandwich is the right mix of decadent and fresh.... Oh and if the husband gets the biscuits and gravy.... Put a little gravy on that sandwich and it's heavenly. Plus, they give you real cream for your coffee... Did you hear me? Heavy fricken cream!!! So good. Make sure you follow these guys on facebook for their beautiful daily specials that you wouldn't find in any other diner in the world (fresh made chicken and dumplings with butter poached chanterelle mushrooms for example). Have the pb and bacon burger... So yummy. Drinks? Forget about it, they are fantastic and happy hour has great specials. Sit inside the diner for great conversation and a bit of a show during your meal. Don't hesitate in trying this place out.

After sadly missing the ISC here in May, I knew I had to make it here eventually to try some Salvadoran food. Upon arrival, I wasn't sure how delicious the food would be as it isn't the most beautiful restaurant in the world. Luckily, you can't judge a book by its cover. I tried the bean and cheese and loroca pupusas, corn tamale, fried banana with beans, meat empanada type things, and the dessert banana empanadas. The food was so ridic tasty, especially the loroca pupusa.... what is loroca? Some kind of flower herb... I have no idea, but it was flavorful and fantastic. The bananas were caramelized and delicious. The tamale was a bit dry, but still tasty. The meat pie things were probably my least favorite item, but still not bad. The dessert... ohhh the dessert was good. Fried banana with some kind of white deliciousness inside (the waitress said it was milk, it had the consistency of rice pudding.... I didn't want to ask anything else haha) rolled in sugar. It was great. I will definitely return to this fantastic restaurant!

I've been wanting to try Rito's for a long time, but their hours are fairly prohibitive  (only open at lunch time when I happen to be working). I finally made it over spring break and it was fantastic! I never would have known this place existed without Yelp, as the building is on a side street and doesn't particularly look like a restaurant from the outside. Anyway.... once you approach the location, you'll know you're in the right place by the long line coming out the door.... It's that good. I went with my dad and we shared a green chili pork chimi, a guac and beef taco, a cheese enchilada, and chips and salsa. Everything was tasty, but the green chili was by far the best. It was just the right amount of spicy and flavorful. I would highly suggest going to try the green chili pork in any form... you can thank me later. I will be back ( schedule permitting :-P)!

How had I not been here before?!?! This place is close to my house, yet I never noticed it. I went here with the International Supper Club and was surprised at what a nice place this was. The ladies who work here were wonderful and accommodating to our ever growing party (uhh 2 more chairs please?) and managed to get most (not all) of the food out at around the same time for over 20 people... pretty good stuff. I went out on a limb, not being a fish person, and ordered the fish fillet divorciados and my risk came with great reward... this was delicious! It was a lightly fried fish fillet (that was HUGE) covered in half red sauce and half green. The red sauce was fairly good, but the green sauce was amazing... spicy, yet fresh tasting. The fish was so flaky and perfectly cooked.... it wasn't fishy at all. The plate was so huge, I shared with two other people and was still stuffed. As good as my dish was, the other couple dishes I tried weren't as delicious. I tried the fish tacos, which were very weird...like mini quesadillas with little bits of fish inside and they tasted very fishy....not my cup of tea. The al pastor tacos were alright, but nothing special. I think the key to this restaurant is to get the seafood (duhhhh). We also got to try several of their cakes which were all alright, but none were amazing. The coconut cake was my favorite. Anyway, I would definitely come here again!

I went here on the 4th of July with a huge party (my family). When we entered they had a kids pool full of nasty water up front because their roof was leaking...not so nice. The waiters were nice, allowing us to go to the bar to order our apps and drinks in order to get hh pricing and dealing with our giant party. Unfortunately, the food at Macayos is just not very good and is WAY overpriced. I got the baja chicken quesadilla and it was fairly dry and bland. It also took a huge amount of time to get our food (but I understand that due to our party size and the fact that it was a holiday). If it were up to me, I probably would not eat at Macayo's again....but I know I'll probably end up back there at some point. Please don't let your friends convince you to come here! With all of the Mexican food options in Phoenix, there is no reason to come here.

The BF took me here last night, as it used to be a hang out for him when he was younger. It was a pretty fun time. The place is not real 'hip' I would say, but everyone seemed to be having fun. They had tvs playing the basketball game and the place was pretty busy at around 8:30 when we went there. We ordered a couple beers (I got a Hef and he got a black velvet I think.... cider and Guinness) and we ordered a shepherd's pie and some fries. The beers were good and the food was really tasty. It was exactly what I wanted but didn't know I wanted. The shepherd's pie is really mashed potato -y and the meat is really tasty.... very flavorful. The pie is huge too so I wouldn't think twice about sharing it. After that he got a jameson and ginger ale and I got a couple shots- a buttery nipple (the best shot) and an orgasm shot (ok... not as good as the other). The BF's drink was huge... like a pint of whiskey. Anyway, the night was good, I like the atmosphere (they also have pool and darts and all kinds of stuff to do) and the drinks were nice too, our total was around 50$ after tip so not too bad for the amount of stuff we got. I would definitely go back in the future.

I went here with my dad today for lunch at his suggestion. We got here around 11:45 and this place was hopping! We were sat right away and the very efficient servers came and gave us soup straight away. It was egg drop with chicken, which isn't my favorite, but it was ok. We decided to order some potstickers and an order of Hong Kong style noodles with chicken. It took five minutes for them to bring out the food... wow. The potstickers were really good, and the potsticker sauce was a nice balance of savory and sweet. The noodles were also very good. They were crispy, just like I like them. All of the veggies tasted really good, I could taste each veggies' individual flavor. It had snow peas, broccoli, carrots, and celery. It was all really great. So why four stars? I didn't really like the soup so much, I think it is so lame that restaurants give egg drop soup (In my opinion, it is the worst, and what about people with egg allergies?), and also the sauce on the noodles could have been more flavorful. Overall though, this place was really good, and I wouldn't mind going back here again.

This is a great place to find records. I found a lot of old records I was looking for including Johnny Cash, Paul Simon, and Billy Joel. They have a large selection and most of them are reasonably priced. The BF bought a sealed copy of Folsom Prison this weekend for 35$....pretty cool find. If I am seriously looking for something, this place is my first stop.

This review is for the gas station. I went the other day and not only was the screen old and I could barely see it, but there was no auto shut off on the pump resulting in my gas overflowing all over my car. Really? That is ridiculous. Plus this station is always more expensive than other nearby stations. I don't typically review gas stations....but this one stood out in that it was so not good.

Oregano's.... you know, everyone in Phoenix has probably been to Oregano's, it's like a Phoenix institution. I got take out from this location and it was tasty, nothing crazy, but just what I'd expect after years of eating at Oregano's. We had the hot wings ('of fire'), and they were a little weird tasting but certainly hot, the stuffed rigatoni (tasty pasta with even tastier garlic bread), and the chicken Caesar salad, which is, by far, my favorite item at Oregano's. The chicken Caesar is so good because the chicken is spicy and delicious...that's it. This is a must order. Will I be at Oregano's again? Of course I will.    PS Pizza here isn't that great, you gotta know what to order.

Thank you to Becca and Dave H. for getting me to go to this restaurant. Yes, it had been on my bookmark list for over a year. Yes, every time I went by I said 'I want to go there!' And, yes, I did browse their menu online on several occasions and yet...I never went here. Well, when I got a text from Dave inviting us there, I knew it was time. Boy was I happy! The food here was great. They brought out bread at the beginning of the meal (which is very strange for an Asian noodle place), but the bread was good, especially the cinnamon toast..yum. I ordered the spicy gyoza soup on happy hour for only 5$. It was large enough for two meals and had tons of flavor. The gyoza was nothing special, but the broth was amazing! So spicy and flavorful...it was awesome. I got to try Becca's Tantan noodles (or something) which was spicy noodle soup with ground pork.....ohhhhh definitely what I would get if it weren't happy hour. It was so delicious, similar to the gyoza soup, but with more smokey flavor. It was wonderful. The two guys got the beef curry noodle soup which was odd, but in a good way. It had a middle eastern flavor that was really delicious and something I had never tasted before. It wouldn't be something I would order, but it was very good. The prices were also reasonable, about 10$ pp. Needless to say, I will be back without hesitation!

I came to Raw salon to see Melanie and must say I was surprised when I entered. From the outside, Raw looks... well... pretty raw. It's in a strip mall and doesn't really stand out. When you walk inside, it's like being in another world - the salon is totally cute! Upon arrival, I was offered wine... huge bonus. I know the stylists here are independent business owners, but it didn't hurt that my haircut is a really good one. I would come back!

Uuugh...I went here for father's day again with the family this morning....I think this should probably be the last visit. It was fairly empty in there this morning (probably a pretty bad sign given that it is father's day). We sat at a large round table in the back of the restaurant. The service was actually fair today except the waitress forgot much of the food ordered and had to make several trips to get everyone their food. Speaking of the food, it was pretty terrible. I had the two egg breakfast with eggs over medium. The eggs were overcooked (closer to over hard) and everything on my plate tasted like burnt bacon. I did not order bacon. Turns out everyone's food tasted like burnt bacon because they don't properly clean their flat top or pans or whatever they cook on. The potatoes were inedible....soggy and flavored like....burnt bacon. My bagel was burnt on the side with the toppings and soft on the side that should be toasted. My brother, Scott O., had pancakes which he said tasted bland. The BF had latkes which were thick, burnt, and somehow not crispy. The applesauce that came with it was so watery...almost like apple juice. No one enjoyed the food, and we are Jewish (btw) so we are very familiar with Jewish food and Jewish delis. With so many good breakfast restaurants in Phoenix, there is no excuse to come here. Honestly, I would have rather eaten at home.

This may have been some of the best Italian take out I have had in the midtown/downtown Phoenix area in a long time. The husband and I picked up some delicious food here last night. We split a calzone with pepperoni and basil, a side of meatballs, and an order of garlic bread. Total? 18$...whaaaat?!?! Awesome! and it was a ton of food too. The meatballs were really good, soft, but not too soft, and flavorful. The garlic bread was nothing too special, but it was standard. The calzone was very good. They loaded this thing with basil, it wasn't like a little bit here and there, so I appreciated that. Additionally, it had a lot of pepperoni...too much for me, but the husband loved that. They top the calzone with garlic and bake until it's golden brown.... this thing was so delicious and large, we certainly had leftovers. I also found out that this place will deliver all the way out to my house at 15th ave and mcdowell....awesome! This may be my new go to pizza.    PS this place is very accommodating, they have vegan and gluten free menus... awesome!

How have I never been here before? This restaurant is ridiculous. It is over the top, covered in Texas themed stuff, business cards covering the ceiling, and complete with Texas sized portions. I came here with my dad and his friend yesterday for lunch and was very impressed with this place. The lunch prices are a total steal, with most entrees costing 8$ and the portions big enough for two people. We split the (house specialty) chicken fried steak and a brisket sandwich. I don't know that I've ever had chicken fried steak before, and I don't know that I would ever have it again (the idea of frying steak just doesn't sit well with me.... if I'm gonna eat steak, I want to taste it), but this CFS was fairly good. The meat was surprisingly tender, the gravy was flavorful, the portion was obscenely large. It came with very tasty mashed potatoes, a biscuit, and some plain jane corn. The biscuit was good, but not the best in town. The real star of this place was the brisket. Ohhhh the brisket gods smile on this place for sure. Their brisket is super tender and the sauce they put on it was heavenly. I ate the brisket with a fork out of the bun because the bun just obscured the awesome brisket flavor, no need for it. I will definitely come back here for the brisket!

I had my dog groomed here over the holiday weekend (tried to get him in other places, but they were al booked). The experience was fairly good. The girls who worked there were friendly and the puppy came out smelling good and minus all his matted hair (just got him from the shelter). I would come back here, though, for the price i would prefer to support a local business (priced were about the same).

Who doesn't like Vienna beef? Vienna beef is pretty much the only kind of hot dogs I will eat because they are so tasty. I came here and had a chicago dog and it was good....but really, how could it be bad? It had the neon green relish and the sport peppers, it was great. The fries were crispy and salty. The price was right (2 of us ate for about 10$). I used to come to Luke's as a kid, and it's just as good now as it was then. Definitely drop by if you're in the neighborhood!

I had my birthday dinner here tonight with the family and it was fairly good. I got there 30 minutes early and decided to have a happy hour drink at the bar. Well.... their definition of well drink is a little different than most places, for example, they do not offer a well margarita.....pretty odd. The bartender was terse and I did not care for him. Anyway, as my family arrived we decided to sit down. We had made a reservation through open table and they accommodated our party of 12, so that is a positive. The food was good, not amazing, but solid. My family is big into sharing so I got to try the beef tenderloin (good and came with a tasty chipotle potato), the chicken special (chicken with green chile and really good goat cheese polenta), the pork tenderloin (this was maybe the best thing, it had a really flavorful sauce and horseradish mashed potatoes), and the ribs (flavorful, but a little drier than I prefer). We also split Caesar salads which were tasty, they had very well seasoned croutons. The service was good considering our large party size and it was an enjoyable place to have a large party.   I kind of think of it in terms of a wedding....a lot of wedding food isn't amazing but it works because it works for big groups....I think this place is like that. I probably wouldn't go here for a date, but I would come here with a big group again.

How have I never been to the Swizzle Inn before?? Thanks to Reese J, I got to go last night, and it was quite the experience. Lots of people having a veeery good time (especially for it being only about 8:30). It was busy, but we found seats at the bar. There was only one bartender, but she did a great job, there was never a time when we had to wait long for a drink. I had a couple 7 and 7s and they were strong and cheap (4$ each). The bathrooms were really clean for a dive bar and had free tampons... always a nice touch. I would definitely go back!

I can't believe I never wrote a review for this place. After having the pearl fall out of a very important ring, I came to Burland to have the ring fixed. They did a fairly good job - the pearl is still in place, but there was some excess glue type stuff on the ring and the pearl and the pearl was placed in the ring slightly off center. I am grateful that they fixed my ring, but it wasn't the best job ever. They did do the work for a fair price.

NYPD pizza is overall good pizza in Phoenix. I have been to several of the locations and they are fairly consistent. They have pizza by the slice, which I like, and you can get all kinds of toppings on your pizza for cheap -ish. I had a slice with garlic, basil, meatball, tomato, goat cheese, and something else I can't think of right this second....it was pretty delicious. The BF and I shared some spinach artichoke dip as well, which is always delicious and terrible for you. The service is somewhat inconsistent, sometimes it is fast and friendly and sometimes it is slow for no apparent reason. The last time I went it was the latter. Despite this, I would go back because the pizza is tasty and cheap.

Ok, I am totally breaking some of my general Yelp rules here...but I have to, because this place was so good. I generally don't give 5 stars on a first visit and I also don't generally give 5 stars to a chain restaurant, but this place really blew me away. The BF and I went here last night for Restaurant Week. We had actually just gotten our reservation because we had a res somewhere else but then had to be out til after the other place closed....lucky I guess. So anyway, we get there and there is complimentary valet (which I generally find annoying, but was nice last night because we were running late). We came into the restaurant and immediately felt welcome, everyone was very friendly. We were seated right away and our waitress, Sarah, came by to explain the menu. She was super friendly and helpful and really on top of things, so that was nice.    Ok, the food: After being seated, they bring out an assortment of warm breads with softened butter. And I mean a real assortment: cracker type bread, a roll that looks like an everything bagel, delicious onion bread, and a wheat bread with raisins or some kind of fruit in it....each bread was delicious (take that Atkins!). The BF ordered a Manhattan ($11.50) and said it was 'damn good' and he is a regular Manhattan drinker, so I gotta believe it. So start, I had the french onion soup (on Sarah's recommendation) and the BF had the field greens. The soup was SO good. I generally am not a huge fan of french onion soup because it has a weird texture, but this one was full of flavor and had a ton of cheese on it. I literally was peeling cheese off the side of the bowl and eating it (I know, not so cool in a fancy restaurant...but it was so tasty!). The field green salad was light, with a flavorful, but subtle vinaigrette. It had several types of tomatoes on it, which the BF loved. For mains I had the filet mignon and the BF had the kona sirloin. They came with a little share plate of mashed potatoes and green beans. The sirloin was delicious...it had this amazing sauce on it (don't know what it was, but it has some great caramelized onions in it) and was cooked perfectly. The filet was equally good, it was simple, but cooked to perfection, it was melt in your mouth and had the perfect steak texture (no fat, gristle, anything weird feeling). I will say, the filet was even better with a little of the sauce from the sirloin, but I understand why the serve it the way they do (steak purists and all....). The mashed potatoes were divine. They were some of the most creamy, buttery mashed potatoes I have had. I wanted to lick the plate. The green beans were also delicious, very well seasoned and served with onions....yum! Now on to dessert- We shared the creme brulee and the chocolate espresso cake. Both were amazing.... When I had my first bite of the chocolate cake it was like the most intense chocolate explosion in my mouth. The espresso just adds to the intensity. I will say this, this is a dessert to be shared...it truly is too chocolatey (and large) for one person....and I love chocolate. The creme brulee was equally amazing, it was creamy with just a hint of crunch, but the most impressive part (to me anyway) was it had blackberries on it that had no seeds. What?!?! Where do I get these blackberries? They were phenomenal!   At the end of the meal, Sarah went outside and had the valet bring our car around before we even left so we didn't have to wait....ummm, seriously awesome service.   So, overall, the meal was excellent. I probably ate about 3000 calories....sorry thighs....but if I got to choose a place to destroy my diet, this would be it. The restaurant week deal was amazing too because my steak alone was 41$, but the whole meal was 30$ on special. Insanity. I would definitely come back again.

The BF and I went here tonight as part of the Coffee Tour of Phx FTW! We had just eaten at Delux and came here 5 minutes before they closed (I know.... we felt like jerks). The girl who worked there was nice, though, and made us coffee without being too angry. Ok... these lattes were good! Like... Very good! I'm happy we were jerks and went in here right before they closed because now I know of another good coffee place in Phoenix... which is more of a rarity than you'd think. Go get a hot latte and be happy!

I have been to other Manuel's in the past and a couple weeks ago I just wanted to have so good 'bad' Mexican food, so we went here. This was a huge disappointment. The BF and I got very 'easy' and Americanized dishes- I got a cheese crisp and rice and he got a bean and cheese burrito. I will say the cheese crisp was pretty disappointing. It had no flavor at all....none of that delicious cheesy goodness that is the essence of Americanized Mexican food.... I definitely will not be back here again.

I went here on a whim when the husband and I's anniversary dinner plans fell through. It was a wonderful experience! They have the prix fixe menu (3 course for 25$), but you don't even need to order this if you don't want to, we ordered two apps and two entrees and they brought out surprise desserts for us at the end (we didn't even mention it was our anniversary, I think they do this all the time), also it was less than 25$ pp...we each had wine and coffee and I think our bill was about 65$ or so. The food was very good, I had the coq au vin and it was delicious, rich flavor, and even better the next day. The desserts were wonderful, a chocolate pot and a lemon raspberry dessert...yum! The coffee was great too. I will certainly be back!

I went to this place to use a Groupon and because I miss the food from Hawaii (well..some of it anyway). The food here was pretty typical of a fast food place, not very fresh and the meat was very poor quality and fatty. I got the curry chicken and the BF got the bbq beef. They were pretty meh. I also have tried the veggie noodle soup which was probably the best thing I have had here. It was not 'good' but it was better for sure. I probably wouldn't go back.

How have I never even heard of this place?!?! The husband and I wanted to get Italian and were planning on going somewhere else.... but it was so far away... and we were so hungry.... so I looked on Yelp (of course) and found this hidden gem! This place is so awesome. It is totally a throw back... red table clothes that are wipe cleanable, a CRT tv playing true crimes sitting on the counter, and Donna. Oh my goodness, Donna is one of the most awesome ladies I have come in contact with in a long time. She is definitely an East coast kinda lady, she is a no nonsense straightforward gal, but also a really sweet and thoughtful person.... they were out of lasagna tonight, but she could tell I really wanted it and got the kitchen to make one special for me...how above and beyond is that? Not only that, but the lasagna was legit.... two different types of sausage, a ton of melty cheese, and a nice flavorful sauce. It was also huge, plenty for two meals. It came with garlic bread that was actually garlicky (I know, crazy) and was a great complement to the pasta. We also had a pepperoni calzone which was ridic good. The ricotta was well seasoned, the crust was perfectly cooked, crispy, and had garlicky seasoning on top. I would definitely get this again. Oh ya, it was also big enough for two meals. All of this food was 20$.... you heard me, 20$!!! This was quite the deal. I think we found our new favorite Italian place in Phoenix.... We'll be back and suggest you give it a shot too!   PS they are BYOB PPS this place has 5 star potential, I just need a second visit to confirm the experience.

I attended dog training with my puppy here with Ashley. Ashley was great, very knowledgeable, and taught us many helpful things to train our dog. The staff here are all friendly and helpful. I would recommend the training classes to anyone.

Ok, I have been to LGO several times since my last review. No, I have not been back for breakfast, as there are so many good breakfast places, I would hate to waste a meal on a place that wasn't awesome. However, the pastries and gelato are wonderful. I got their french sea salt brownie a few times...but the one I got this week tied for best brownie in phoenix (with Lux, of course). It was ohhh sooo good. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Also, their chocolate pudding, red velvet cake, cookies, the gelato with the almond and lingonberry, the salted caramel gelato, their ridic nutella croissants, and just about all of their other pastries are amazing. I return again and again for their desserts...and you should too...    PS This place is especially awesome after a delish Ingo's burger... not to put in a shameless plug or anything.

Went to this location today to get some cat food (had a coupon specific to Petco). This place was a mess. There was stuff everywhere. There were boxes in the middle of many of the aisles...we couldn't even reach some items due to the amount of stuff everywhere. Things are hard to find here, their order makes no sense. We walked around in circles trying to find the food we wanted (is it in the natural section...no... with the other Science Diet stuff....no.... oh in a random other aisle...yup).  If I can help it, I won't come to this location again.

Ok, so it was kind of funny. I have a friend in visiting from out of town and her parents are here also visiting family. So on Wednesday night I decided to take her to Postino, because I went to the one on Central and loved the food (hated the service, but the food was great). So I took her to this location. Much better! The place was way less busy (i guess that's because it wasn't one of their special nights) and we were seated right away. We even found parking over by LGO. Whoa. So, anyway, We shared a bruschetta board with the brie and apple, the goat cheese and bell pepper, burrata and bacon, and prosciutto and mascarpone and we each got a glass of wine. (I got the Haart riesling.... *drool* that has got to be one of the best rieslings I have had). So the bruschetta was good, I thought the goat cheese one was not all I had hoped for, but the apple and brie was wonderful and so was the burrata and bacon... I think burrata is my new favorite cheese.... that stuff is good! Anyway, it  was a nice night and everything was fine. So fast forward to the next day. I went with my friend and her parents to the botanical gardens and then we were going to get lunch, so I list a bunch of places we can go and they decide they want to go to LGO (Now I've never been there but really want to try their pizza, it looks amazing). So we get there and realize A) there is no table service and B) there is no pizza. Lame. So my friend says.... we could go back to postino..... haha! So we ended up going again! two days in a row.   So the second time we all got paninis and salads (and wine.... yum and 5$). I got the half and half with the turkey panini and the italian picnic salad. The turkey sandwich was pretty good, it had tomato, greens, pesto, and provolone on it. It tasted good, but nothing too special. The italian picnic salad was also just ok. I couldn't taste the vinaigrette that's supposed to be on it at all... maybe they forgot to put it on... or maybe it is ridiculously light. The other ingredients were good, it had beets, greens, goat cheese, walnuts, and some crispy things in it. My friend got the prosciutto sandwich, which I tried and it was delicious. Her dad got the nine iron which looked really good. Anyway, this was not as good an experience as the night before, but it evens out to four stars. Yay postino!

This has got to be the best chinese in phoenix. The food is always fast and fresh. The servers are always attentive and friendly. This place is just great to go to. I normally get the chicken chow mein and my bf gets the sweet and sour chicken and both are excellent. The sweet and sour chicken isn't one of those gross fried puffballs covered in sugar, it's a real chicken breast, fried crispy and sliced. It makes such a difference. I have been coming here for years and my waiter Ed (who isn't there much anymore) always remembered us and knew what we wanted to order from memory. Now that's good service.

I still like Desert Jade. I go there every once in awhile. The noodles are not as crispy as they used to be and the food is not as fresh as it once was, but I still enjoy the food here. I went for lunch today. My mom got chicken with snow peas, which was very good and I had wonton soup, which was pretty bland. The sweet and sour chicken is still the BF's favorite and the service is still very good. They are always efficient. And the almond cookies....yum.

They're back! I have been a few times in the last few months and must say that Desert Jade is back to 5 stars in terms of food quality. The pan fried noodles are perfectly crispy and delicious. The sizzling rice soup (my new fave item) is flavorful and the veggies in it taste fresh. They still have the husband's favorite sweet and sour chicken (made with chicken that is fried and then sliced... that makes all the difference). The service is still great, in fact, we have been coming to Desert Jade for almost 10 years now and many of the staff members are the same, which is very cool. On top of that, they remember you, have personal conversations with you, and remember your order. You really can't beat the service. Additionally, the food never takes more than 15 minutes to come out. Other notable dishes are the pot stickers (made in house, not my fave in town, but a good solid effort), the spicy red sauce (yummm), and the lettuce wraps. Definitely check them out!   PS They still provide hot tea to the table, a nice touch, but they stopped the almond cookies.... this is sort of heartbreaking... bring back the almond cookies pleeease!!!

This was one of the most pleasant oil change experiences I have ever had. No waiting and it took them about 15 minutes to complete the whole thing. Everyone was friendly. It was great! It was a little expensive at 40$, but I would gladly pay the price to not have to wait there for 2-3 hours....everyone knows that is just awful. I'll be back.

The husband and I went to this nursery last weekend to get some veggie plants. This nursery had a large variety of veggie plants in various stages  (seeds, 2 inch plants, 4 inch plants. fully grown). The people who work here helped me choose some plants that would be at least somewhat difficult for me to kill....I do have a brown thumb, ya know? I ended up getting several different veg plants for a fairly reasonable price that I planted the next day. Well, it has been a week and not only have I not yet killed these plants, but they are actually flowering! The small victories... I would definitely come here again for my planting needs and suggest you do too, gotta like a nice local nursery.

My whole family went here last night for my oldest brother's birthday. This restaurant was very accommodating to our large party. They even sat us before everyone was there, and we appreciated that. We ordered a bunch of food, a couple pizzas, a couple sandwiches, bruschetta, salad, ravioli, meatballs.... a lot of food. Their pizza is always good and my brother swears that this location is the best and has the best crust of all the locations. I thought the pizza was good, the italian salad dressing was very good, and the ravioli and meatballs were tasty. I thought the bruschetta was just ok... but overall, this place is very good. I would recommend it to anyone for some classic italian food, plus about 10 of us ate for 100$....pretty good deal.

I went to Fleur De Lis last night for a tasting for my wedding cake. The experience was overall very odd. We have been to 3 tastings before this one, and this was by far the weirdest. We sat in a front room with a bunch of fake cakes. We waited 5-10 minutes before the owner I suppose came out to talk with us, but instead of getting right into the cake info, she got all of our personal info first. She asked me if I had pictures of any cakes that I liked, so I showed her some pictures while I explained what I liked about each one. After showing her and telling her, she asked me 'what do you like about that one?' Ummm...I just told you. (ex: Me:Here is a cake I like, I like that it is square and has different size proportions for the different layers....her: oh, ok what do you like about it?). She then set up a laptop computer and played a slideshow of their cakes. I'm not sure why they do this, especially when I came in knowing what I wanted. Also, the pictures were not awesome...the cakes all looked the same, there must have been 50 cakes that were white with red roses sticking out of the layers. It was some serious boring cakage. Also, some of the cakes had writing on them, but instead of looking flush to the cake and professional, it looked like it was piped on at the Fry's bakery (read: birthday cake for a child). So then she brought out the cake samples, there were thin slices of vanilla vanilla, vanilla strawberry, chocolate chocolate, champagne raspberry, and lemon raspberry and maybe some others I can't remember. Honestly, the cake ranged from ok to very not good. The vanilla strawberry was by far the best, and the champagne raspberry was by far the worst. That raspberry filling was atrocious. It tasted chemically or something and the combo with the champagne cake was terrible. The chocolate was boring, tasted like grocery store cake and I'm pretty sure the 'frosting' that was on the outside of all the cakes was cool whip. It definitely was not butter cream and it was light like whipped cream, but was clearly non dairy. When the owner came out (after letting us sit out there for like 15 minutes or so...a very long period of time), we told her straight up we just didn't really like the cake, no offense, but it was not for us. She then told us that they only make the samples once every 2 weeks and we were at the end of that time period. Wow. Just so you know, they charge 15$ for tastings. For 15$ we got the equivalent of 1 slice of 2 week old cake....and they're trying to gain my business? That is definitely unforgettable, but not so much in a good way. So anyway, the owner was gracious and offered us a second tasting if we wanted, but honestly there is no way I would buy my cake from them after what I experienced.    PS My brother got his wedding cake from this bakery a couple years ago, which is why I tried it and I remember it being fairly good, so maybe something has changed, or maybe it really is better when it is fresh, but I'm not willing to take that risk.

I went here with a friend for restaurant week tonight. I was teetering between 3 and 4 stars but decided the amazing view and service made it a 4 star experience. We started with the short rib ravioli, which was really delicious. The short rib was tender and it came on top of some corn that was sweet and tasty. Definite win with that dish. They also brought out bread with pesto, garlic butter, and a goat cheese dip so that was also fantastic. My only complaint was that the entrees were a little hum drum. I had the hangar steak and my friend had the pork and both were just lacking in overall flavor and both were a little on the dry side (and I ordered mine medium so that's not really expected). Had it not been restaurant week, I would've been upset to have spent as much money as these entrees normally cost. The desserts were also good, we split the turtle and the espresso cup, but they weren't mind blowingly delicious. I would maybe come back here for the view, but the food was not good enough to warrant the price.

We picked up some pizza from here last night to take over to a friend's house and this is the Red Devil I always went to for family functions as a kid. I love this restaurant! The pizza was delicious and what really makes it is their italian dressing.....This dressing is soooo good and perfect to dip crust into. In the past I have tried many of their items, but mainly order their ravioli, which have always been quite tasty. Don't pass this place up for tasty pizza and pasta.

I have to say, after going to several bridal shops, this David's Bridal was the absolute worst. This was the first place I went to try on dresses. I went with my mom on a Wednesday afternoon a couple months ago. The store was totally empty except for us and I had an appointment. The girl who was helping us pulled out some of the dresses I had marked online. She also gave me a special bra for the fitting...but she gave me the wrong size and did not tell me it was the wrong size (I thought I was shrinking!) because they didn't have my size. Really? It is a VERY common size. So, that alone made the dresses look weird. So I tried on a couple dresses, but wasn't really feeling them. I asked the girl (Meghan, I think) if she knew of any nontraditional or funky dresses I could try on and she brought out a few things, but they just were not my style. She didn't spend the time talking to me or looking at my picks from the internet to know what I wanted. Throughout this process, the sales lady would disappear for periods of time (don't know to where considering the store was empty) and I would have to sit around waiting. Then, I asked if I could try on a Vera Wang dress, and she informed me that they only had it in a size 4 (I'm a bridal size 8). I asked her if I could just slip it on open to get an idea of what it would look like. She refused. She held it up to me on the hanger, but would not let me set foot in it. Ridiculous! This sure as hell is not the way to sell dresses. After that move, I was done. I was totally insulted and didn't find anything special anyway, so I moved on. I would not recommend this to anyone.

I used to love this place when I was in high school...they had the best sandwiches. Well now, 10 years later (wow.), the sandwiches are still very tasty. I went yesterday with the BF for lunch and, despite a few flaws, it was really good. I had a half build your own sandwich and a cup of soup and the BF had a build your own sandwich. They forgot to put some of the items we asked for on both sandwiches....they forgot the BF's cheese and they forgot a couple of my veggies. Additionally, I asked for the pesto on the side and it came out on the sandwich, so I was not thrilled with that. Despite these errors, the food still tasted good. We both had turkey sandwiches, I had mine on focaccia with a bunch of veggies and the BF had his on sourdough with bacon. Both sandwiches had fresh ingredients and soft bread...very good. I also had the albondigas soup which was a bit on the greasy side, but had a lot of flavor. I'm glad this place has maintained its quality and I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the neighborhood.

The husband and I decided to come to the Stockyards for his birthday this year, and, I must say, it was very enjoyable! I made a reservation on opentable and noted that it was his birthday. This was not ignored, he was greeted with a 'happy birthday!' and given fabulous service all night. We had a wonderful waitress... I can't remember her name (sorry!), but the service was friendly, funny, timely... everything you could ask for. They start you with a basket of delicious cornbread and biscuits paired with honeybutter and a crudite plate with more than your usual veggies (watermelon radish, jicama, etc). Every entree comes with soup or salad, I had the soup which was seafood chowder and was pretty good, packed full of seafood. The husband had the salad, also tasty with a nice balsamic dressing. For mains, I had a filet mignon and the husband had a new york strip... I had the au gratin potato stack thing and he had mashed potatoes. Both steaks were tasty and perfectly cooked. The sides were also great, mine was garlicky and full of flavor, his were perfectly creamy. After dinner, we were so stuffed, but our fantastic waitress brought out a rich chocolatey brownie with ice cream and a candle..... I can't say we didn't eat the whole thing. Thanks to the Stockyards for the delicious and memorable dinner!    PS the whole dinner was under 100$, pretty good!

I would say this park could definitely get a 5 star, but the trails I have been on here are more of a 4 star. I went to Mormon trail last weekend and it was enjoyable. My main issue was that there were more than one families that were blasting rap music from their phones on the hike....wtf? That is so inappropriate. I had to run to get away from it. The trail itself was a good hike with nice views and it was challenging and a good workout. The last time I went here I did the Kiwanis trail which I did not care for. It was more of a nature walk with no pay off....you get to the end and you meet a road then you're done. There isn't enough gain in incline to get a good view. I would definitely not hike that one again.

What a cute little local bagel shop in Ahwatukee! I came here with a group of students, and the Nosh was more than accommodating! I called about 30 minutes before we arrived and the employees gladly set up a large table for our group outside. Further, they were so patient and kind to my students. The food was decent and well priced. I had a bagel egg sandwich with bacon for around 6$... not bad at all. They even cooked my egg over medium... fantastic! I would highly recommend the Nosh!

um... yum! How had I not been here before? I work in the neighborhood and had been meaning to come here for a long time, but never got around to it. I finally went to Los Taquitos and was pleasantly surprised. The line was loooong, but went fairly quickly considering the size (we waited about 20 min in line). I came on a taco tuesday (1$ chicken and al pastor tacos) and had one al pastor taco, one carne asada taco, and a beef tamale. Each item was delicious and fresh tasting. The sauces on the meats were perfect and the salsas were perfectly spiced to complement the food. The tamale had a nice consistency and the meat was tender. I would definitely come here again, but maybe try to come at an off time.

I have to give props to Mo who works at this location of Nellos pizza. I came in today with a school group and she was amazing. She took care of us without hesitation and was great with the kids. Things can get a little messy with our bunch, but   she didn't seem to mind at all. The service was incredible. The food is nothing crazy special... Decent pizza, very tasty house salad dressing. Everything seemed fresh. I would recommend this restaurant and thank you again Mo!

I found my new dentist! Dr. Ito and his staff have been nothing but nice and accommodating. I had some sensitivity in a back tooth and this office fit me in within the week to take a look. Not only that, but I got several calls from them offering earlier times when they could see me due to cancellations... how awesome is that? Further, Dr. Ito is very personable and spends a significant amount of time with his patients, way more than other dentists I have been to. I would recommend this office for your dental needs!

I used to go to islands a lot when I was in high school and used to love the tortilla soup. I came back and had to have the soup! It was fairly disappointing.... Not very flavorful at all. Nothing like I remember. I tried a burger too...definitely not as delish as it was expensive. I probably wouldn't return.

I went here for Mother's day with a big group of family. The dinner was a disaster. My uncle made the reservation for the wrong number of people, so I felt bad for the waitress, but it didn't excuse the poor service and food that we had. We were seated in the middle of the packed restaurant and the waitress came around and took everyone's orders. I ordered the build your own pasta with a caesar salad. The salad had barely any dressing on it, and was quite bland. Then our party waited about an hour and fifteen minutes for our dinners. In addition, we were not given any bread after the initial 3 loaves for 18 people nor water for about 20 minutes until we flagged someone down to get some. When the food came out, there were many mistakes. I do not know how they can mess up the build your own pasta because the customer fills out a paper form and checks the ingredients that are wanted.... well they did. My cousin got the same thing and ordered meatballs and meat sauce, and was brought out marinara with mushrooms.... hmmm. I ordered chicken, garlic, broccoli, spinach, and marinara. Well, it had no spinach and 2 cloves of garlic. The chicken was all fat, like it was what you cut away from a chicken breast before cooking it. It was some of the grossest chicken I have tasted. My brother ordered a dish that was supposed to have shrimp and some other meat in it...it came out in the smallest bowl I have ever seen and contained 1 shrimp. Really? Wow. All of the food was bland and of poor quality. I noticed their prices have gone down, but obviously it is at the sake of the quality.

I went here with my mom and sister in law today for happy hour. I must say.... I don't understand why people say this place is so good. Even my mom was raving about it as we left and I do not understand it. We got a ton of food, calamari, artichoke dip, pretzel sticks, chicken lettuce wraps, and my mom got a burger. The calamari was probably the best thing, it was a little spicy and had a nice enough flavor. The artichoke was nasty, if this wasn't frozen I would be shocked. It tasted like it had some of the lowest grade cheese (or processed cheese) and had a weird plastic look and texture. The pretzel sticks were dry and bland. The lettuce wraps were also bland.... the peanut sauce that came with it made it better, but not by a whole lot. The lettuce wraps are better at PF Changs and Cheesecake factory... and I don't like either of those restaurants. My mom liked her burger. I didn't try it. Overall it was a lackluster and bland experience. If I had the choice, I would not eat here again.   PS there was a lady with a screaming toddler in the bar area and this older lady turned around and told her off..... it was definitely the highlight of the meal.

I went here today with a friend to get a mani and pedi for only 30$... a really good deal! It was really just an ok experience... the salon is basically in the middle of a bunch of closed store fronts... kind of depressing. The salon isn't very pretty, but that doesn't really matter. I had Ann and she was good, I liked my mani and pedi. It was a little strange because she did the mani while I was still sitting in the pedicure chair... but whatever. I didn't like that we were constantly being sold things, even though this isn't that weird, they tried to sell us designs, waxing, gels, and shellac. We didn't want any of it.... so it was a little weird. My friend's mani and pedi was not as good as mine. The woman who did her nails was a little rough and left some parts of her nails less painted than others, like near her cuticles. So, I think it is kind of like, you get what you pay for.... I don't know if I'd go back, but I have had much better mani and pedis elsewhere. So if you want a cheap, but fine manicure, this is a good place. Otherwise... maybe try somewhere else, like nails 8000 down the street, which is much nicer.  Update... the manicure chipped the next day.... can see grow out and the nail polish seems cheap. The top coat is inadequate. It is not even worth the 30$s because it won't last.

I can't believe I hadn't tried this place before...and it is about a mile away from my house! I went last night with the BF after scouring yelp for somewhere to get sandwiches (he wanted a sandwich...I pretty much never want a sandwich). We came across this place, and I'm not sure what it is about it or what I had heard that made me not really want to go here....but I reluctantly agreed. Turns out, it is really and surprisingly good! I got the jamaican red which is chicken (and the chicken is like chunks of chicken breast, which is perfect for this kind of sandwich) some kind of spicy red seasoning/sauce, jalapenos, bell peppers, and cheese. It was really spicy and tasty. The BF got the Thai stick and it was also very good, but with more of a sweet flavor. I like that all of the sandwiches are toasted, and toasted for enough time that the bread is crunchy and everything inside is ooey gooey....a lot of other places can take note that this is like the definition of awesome when it comes to toasting a sandwich. We also got the garlic bread....it was good, very large for the money, but the sandwiches were a bit better.   I would come back here for a good cheap meal again.

I went here today with three friends to get pedicures to celebrate being finished with our first year of grad school (Woot!). This place was wonderful! The girls who work there were very accommodating, when I called to make our appointments they said there were only 3 people working, when I said I would call them back, she promptly said it would be no problem and that they would make it happen, and they did. It was probably the best pedicure I've ever had. They have 4 different levels of pedicures and I got the level 2 which was 23$. It included a foot scrub, all the normal pedicure stuff, sugar scrub, hot towels, 10 minute massage with oils (which was awesome), and for an extra 7$ the person who was doing my nails (Amy) did a beautiful design on both of my big toes including a gem on each and some sparkle polish along the edges of each toenail. It is so pretty! I will definitely return to this place, it far exceeded my expectations.

I went here with some friends last weekend to use a Groupon (4 people, shoe rental and 1 hour unlimited for 15$ woohoo!). I thought it was nicer than some other bowling alleys in Phoenix. The shoes were fairly new, which is always pleasant, the balls were organized by weight in a clear fashion, which was also nice. The only problem was the game froze a couple of times and the time kept ticking away, so we lost out on some time BUT at the end of our hour (of speed bowling) we only had a few frames left on our last game and the guys there gave us an extra 10 minutes for free to finish up, so that was very nice. I would come back here.

As far as the chain breakfast -y places go, Village Inn gets top marks. This is my go-to pie spot PLUS you get free pie on wednesday if you order anything....like a coffee....so pretty excellent. The BF and I went here tonight (for free pie) and got breakfast for dinner.... They have the same idea as Denny's build your own grand slam, but I like this one because there are way more options and pretty good options too like crepes, waffles, omelets....all kinds of fancy stuff (for a place like this anyway). The service has always been good for me at this location, especially from the (I think...) manager. Everyone is friendly. I'd definitely hit this place up for a fairly reasonably priced breakfast....not for a wonderful super creative breakfast....just a....I need a decent breakfast for a decent price type. Go local if you want something special.

Yum! Finally I found good chinese on the east side. I was driving to arcadia for chinese for months before I stumbled upon this place. Golden Gate has some pretty yummy food. They are not the cheapest Chinese food in the world, but it is good. I had their wonton soup, which was really good, their beef with asparagus, which was just ok.. too much asparagus and not enough beef, and their garlic chicken. Now the garlic chicken was the real star. I ordered it based on other reviews I have read, and it really was very good. The chicken is fried and then put in a sweet but savory garlic sauce, mmmm. I'll definitely be back to try more things at this restaurant.

So as I said before, this place has great garlic chicken. Delicious. I went back here last night and actually ate there (I've always gotten take out.. so this was a first). It is so worth it to eat there! They give you tea, which is good, and little fried wonton skins with red sauce... yum. So I got the wonton soup again and it was delicious just like the last times... I love their soup. Also, the BF and I decided we wanted to try their potstickers (So he has never liked potstickers, but they are my favorite part of chinese food. So I have not ordered potstickers cuz he won't share them with me... so about a month ago he decided he likes them, so now I can finally have them....yay!). Their potstickers are delicious!!!! They are all crispy on the bottom and still soft on the top and when you cut them open they have the juice on the inside, which is a sign of a good potsticker. The sauce also is good, not the best I've ever had, but very good. It is a bit spicy and has a few green onions, though more would be better. Then we had the wonderful garlic chicken. So the best part about eating in the restaurant is at the end they give you a little fried thing with powered sugar on top.... and in the middle there is banana!!!! So. Good. So go Golden Gate!

This place looks very dirty. I don't know if it is, but I didn't feel very comfortable eating there. I did eat there, though, and the food was pretty mediocre. Nothing had much flavor or spice. I would not come here again.

Ok... I know this is a chain, and generally I'm not a huge fan of chains, but this place is pretty good. First, I like that you can call ahead before you go, it saved us like an hour of sitting around waiting at the restaurant. That was great! I got a strawberry margarita, which costs 7$ and it was HUGE! Also, it was tasty...nothing wrong with that. The food here is also good and the portion sizes are insane. I got the ribs (13$) and had WAY too much food....a caesar salad (which was very tasty), a sweet potato, rolls with cinnamon butter, and a ton of fall off the bone ribs....everything was good. The BF had a steak with corn and a baked potato. Also fairly tasty (but not even close to my ribs...sorry BF). I would definitely come back here because it is super inexpensive for what you get and the food is good.

I went here the other night and it was a fairly not awesome experience. We got there early, and there were only a few people working there. This resulted in us waiting quite a bit to be seated and to get service. We both got the make your own pasta and I got a side caesar salad. I had to wait with my salad for a long time because I didn't have a fork....pretty weird. I felt like I was in coming to America or something. The food was completely bland. I had a mix of arrabiata sauce and garlic...two strong flavors....yet it had no flavor. I just wish I remembered how much this place is not good before I decide to go there again.

This is the Streets location closest to my house, but unfortunately it is very hit or miss. A few months ago I ordered a pizza online in the morning for this location and I went to pick it up at around 8:30pm, paid, and proceeded to sit there for about 45 minutes. I set the pizza to be picked up at 8:30.... WTF? Oh, they thought they put in my order but they didn't. Awesome. I do not know why they think I was sitting there.... In addition, I was not given any kind of discount for my trouble. So since then I have gotten take out from them a couple times which has been fairly good.   Then, the BF and I went here the other day and ate in... we experienced TERRIBLE service, and I think it was one of the managers who was serving us... We were not given the complimentary bread.... then I saw that they brought out some fresh bread and I was going to ask for some, but I could not get the waitress to come over to save my life. I gave her eye contact on multiple occasions, but she was busy cleaning all the other tables and ignoring us. Finally, I asked a different waiter for some bread and it was about the same time we got our food. The waitress said that the bread just came out so.... but it didn't! I watched it come out (she put it out) at least 5 minutes earlier. We were sitting right next to it, I don't know why she would lie about that. So the pizza was good, but I had ordered a cup of soup and it was still cold... like it was for sure frozen before coming to our table. I asked for it to be warmed up, so she put it back in the microwave (yum....) and brought it out luke warm. Awesome. Now, I like streets.... this location is just not that great.

Ugh, my first night in mesa I went and picked this food up. I had no internet and no food in my house  so I had to use proximity as my only judgment of where to eat. There were a lot of people eating here, so that made me feel hopeful for a minute. When I got the food home it was some of the worst food I've had in a long time. I ordered chicken chow mein and it came with those noodles from a bag. The crispy ones used to dip in sweet sauce, not pan fried noodles. Now that may have been my mistake, but what wasn't was that the chicken that was supposed to go over top was poor quality and had this weird white gooey tasteless 'sauce' on it. I couldn't eat it. My boyfriend got sweet and sour chicken which also was poor quality and was not good. I would not recommend this place.

I hadn't been here since I was a kid....but it is just as good now as it was then... if not better! I got a baby size coconut and strawberry daquri with cream and it was ridiculous! That was the biggest baby I've ever seen. It was a tower of ice and cream! I loved the way they put cream on the outside of the ice and layered so you can get some in every bite. Also, the ice is shaved so fine that it has a great texture. I will for sure be back (sorry thighs).....mmmmmm

I went here the other day, as I had a Deal Chicken for this place. I used to go to a really good Salvadorian restaurant in Seattle, and was excited to see there was one right near where I live now. So the BF and I got here at around 8 at night on a Sunday and it was actually pretty busy. This place is in a tiny strip mall that does not look like it gets much business, and I would have never seen it from the road, so it must be good to still be in business. So I ordered a pollo pupusa, a carne asada pupusa, and a polla tamale, and the BF ordered two bean and cheese pupusas and a carne asada pupusa and we split the pastelitos con papas y queso. Well, the pastelitos were pretty tasty, like fried mashed potatoes, and they came with a spicier cabbage slaw which I liked a lot better than the regular cabbage slaw for the pupusas. All of the pupusas were really good, my real problem was with the sauce. The red sauce that came with them was just kind of flavorless. The place I used to go to had some really good red and green sauces for the pupusas... it was kind of disappointing. Also, about 5 minutes after we got the pupusas, the waitress came by and said 'oh I forgot to tell you we don't have any tamales.' Well, that kind of sucks, why did it take til we were already in the middle of eating to tell us? Also, it screwed up the amount I was trying to spend (since I had 20$ to spend on the deal chicken) which I guess shows that this place is cheap, which is good, but for this particular trip that wasn't good. So we decided to order a dessert to replace the tamale. We got the empanadas de platano with sweet cream. So this was a big deal for the waitress, she had already totaled out the bill and for some reason it was a huge deal to add a dessert at the end (which I thought was weird, but felt guilty about giving her extra work). Anyway, the empanadas were ok, but I've had better. The sweet cream is in the middle of the plantain and it isn't all that sweet. Oh well, I would definitely come back here for some yummy pupusas and maybe try a different dessert next time, the central american quesadilla looked pretty tasty....

The BF and I went here for lunch today as we had purchased a groupon for this restaurant a few weeks back and wanted to go to total wine anyway, which is close to the restaurant, so we headed out. We got to the restaurant and it was not too busy, just a few tables. The restaurant was a nice looking restaurant, it was painted a nice color and had interesting metal wall hangings. We're having pizza for dinner tonight so we decided to get a couple sandwiches and the bruschetta. Our server seemed pretty miserable to be there and had a really flat voice. She was not so pleasant. We got the bruschetta and it was not exactly what you would expect. It was like a cheesy garlic bread with tomatoes, garlic, basil, and their balsamic dressing on it. I thought it was pretty good, although the tomatoes were not so fresh and the bread they chose was odd for a bruschetta. The BF, however, really didn't like it. He thought it tasted 'weird.' So then we waited a bit and our sandwiches came out. Here is the real reason for the bad review. The sandwiches just weren't good. I got the chicken panini and the BF got the meatball parm. The meatball parm was really bad. The sauce had no flavor, the meatballs tasted like they were once frozen, and there was a ridiculous amount of cheese on top, like 3/4 of an inch thick. My sandwich was ridiculous. It was giant and looked like a giant salad on bread. The chicken was a breaded cutlet... not super tasty, and supposedly it had their balsamic dressing on it, but I couldn't taste it. It had a lot of raw red onion on it which took over the flavor, and when I took it off all I could taste was the 'pizzette' bread which was overwhelmingly garlicky. I love garlic, but this was too much. It was almost bitter in my mouth. So maybe their pizza is good... I don't know, but what we got was not good. Like so many restaurants, I think this place could use better ingredients and give you much smaller portions for the same price and it would be a lot better.

Yay! NYPD is some pretty good stuff. I've been going to NYPD since I was a kid, but the one in scottsdale. So now that I live on the East side, I go to this NYPD. I had a coupon for a free ten inch pizza (thanks to FB and my trivia knowledge) and went to redeem it a couple days ago, and the pizza was good, as always. We just got a pepperoni pizza, and it was good. I have had many different combinations of toppings and they are always flavorful and fresh. Like getting pepperoni, ricotta, and basil... so good... but soo bad. Their pizza sauce is really flavorful and their crust is usually just firm enough, but not crispy. Also, they have amazing spinach artichoke dip, and now that they let you get a half order.... it's actually affordable to get (which may be a bad thing, health wise). The dip comes with pizza crust bread with cheese on top... so good, the whole order is like a meal for two. Last time we went in, however, the pizza crust bread was a little less cooked than I like, usually it is stable, so you can pick up the dip with the bread and not need a spoon, but the other day, it was kind of floppy... so that was sad, but normally it's fine.  Overall, this is a solid place to get pizza. I feel like there are better pizza places in the valley, but this place is really good and generally more convenient.

The BF and I went here tonight and it was AWESOME!!! This place is a cute little family restaurant that has comforting food for extremely inexpensive. We shared an individual salad, which was fresh and had an abundance of cucumbers and tomatoes...also, the house italian dressing was very tasty. We got an order of breadsticks, which were good, nothing wonderful, but something I would get again. Then we shared a calzone with pepperoni and ricotta cheese that was very good. The calzone crust was golden and delicious and the sauce was also very good. But you wanna know the best part? Our very filling dinner cost 12$. That's right. 12$. That is crazy ridiculous! We will definitely be back here... this may be our new go to pizza place, so hooray for that!

Ok....generally I would not review a Starbucks....BUT I go to this one fairly often considering it is in the parking lot where I park my car on thurs during my internship....long story, whatever. So it's generally pretty good, but today I was in line behind this van for like a bazillion years (15 min).... I got up to the window and the girl had my drink ready AND gave it to me for free! WooHoo! That was super awesome. So for that reason, this location is cool in my book.

Man... the cheesecake factory. I loved this place when I was like 8 years old and they were only located in california. Now, it is just a strange experience. It's strange because people line up to come here and wait an hour sometimes.... for what? The food is mediocre at best and it's incredibly overpriced. Anyway, my brother had given me a gift card to this restaurant for chrisanuka. So I finally got around to using it last night. I was in class until 8 and needed to go someplace that was open late (and since we had the gift card, this was the place). The first thing I really hate about this restaurant is the menu size. It is totally unnecessary and every time I go here I just sit and stare at the menu for ever before figuring out what I want. And it's not because it is all too good, It is trying to figure what type of food do I want, what isn't going to be incredibly ridiculously unhealthy, and what isn't 15$ because that is just too much to be spending on a mediocre meal in a chain restaurant. I could go to a pretty good local restaurant and pay the same. Also, with such a big menu I wonder how much of it could possibly be fresh... everything on their menu can't be ordered everyday...? I don't know. So last night I finally decided on the Saigon chicken sandwich with a side salad and the BF got the club. Both were fine, at least with the sandwiches the portion size isn't quite so crazy.   Kind of on a side note, our waitress last night was really strange. I think she was putting on an accent and she kept including herself in her questions ie Would we like some pepper on our salad? (um I don't know, would you, creepy waitress lady?) Also, I don't know if the restaurant changed, or what, but she spouted off a 5 minute speech when we got there about the menu (and on page 5 you will find this item, and on page 7, this item).... that was really strange. I have the menu right in front of me.... it is large, so maybe I need direction around it, but generally I can read.  So anyway, for two sandwiches, no drinks, we paid 27$. That is insane. But we had the gift card, so it turned out alright.... but seriously... why do people eat here? I do not understand it! What is the appeal!!!?!?!?!?!   Ok sorry for the rant.

As far as chain mexican food, Abuelos has to be the best. I always get the same thing there, two enchiladas both with the con carne sauce and papas and rice. The con carne sauce is delicious. Also, their salsa is interesting and has a decent amount of spice to it. The papas are like mexican mashed potatoes and they are very tasty. In addition, all of the food is very fairly priced. I would choose Abuelos over one of those other overpriced bland mexican chains any day.

The BF and I went here tonight because we were going to a movie and didn't feel like mexican food (which is too bad because abuelos would have been much much better). We wanted a lighter dinner. So he had the bbq chicken salad with no dressing (just BBQ sauce). His was decent, but for 10$ (for the half salad!) was unsatisfactory. It was kind of small and had very little chicken, tomatoes, and corn. It would be nice if the chicken on the salad was hot.... it was not awesome, but not terrible. I got the half peach salad....it was alright, but had possibly a whole red onion in it..... it was super oniony to the point where at the end of the salad I had more onion left than I had eaten (with onion in almost every bite). A bit overwhelming, but the rest of the salad was fine. It had some cranberries and nuts, but could have had more of that, less onion. We also split the chicken quesadilla small plate, which was decent, tasted like their baja tortilla spring roll. I just felt for two half salads and 4 small pieces of quesadilla 24$ was a bit steep. Despite all of this, our service was very good, but I still probably won't be back here soon.

I have been to this location a few times, but the last time I came here was a few nights ago. I just wanted soup because it was cold out and we were at Chandler Mall, so OG seemed like the appropriate choice. We got there and it wasn't too busy and were seated. Our waitress came by and asked us to sample some wine and when we declined she took on this huge attitude and said 'so what DO you want to drink?' with almost disdain in her voice. Whoa lady, sorry for not wanting your cheap wine sold for expensive prices... this was kind of the theme of the night. The waitress seemed to be in a very bad mood. The food was the standard mediocre fair that comes from all OGs. The salad had a giant uncut piece of lettuce in it, the soup was fine, the BF got an alfredo pizza that was dry, but fine. So this place gets a big meh.

I have dreams about their grilled vegetable scramble. I have never had eggs, biscuits, and potatoes taste so good. I wish I could go get it right now. I haven't been here for any non breakfast meal yet, but I would really like to as soon as possible.  Edit: So I went here last night for dinner and it was just as good as breakfast! I went with my Dad and we split the apricot glazed chicken and a veggie pizza. Both were delicious! The chicken was a very large portion and it came with mashed potatoes and roasted whole carrots and asparagus. It looked pretty and tasted great. The glaze was amazing! The pizza was also really good. The veggies were sliced, not chopped, and that was good. It had squash, zucchini, asparagus, mushrooms, and basil. It was really tasty. I want to go back asap! (especially to try dessert)

Mmmmmm, I went back here last night to try their lattes as I haven't tried them yet and my friend and I are on a coffee tour of Phoenix. They were delicious! The coffee was not too acidic and the barista even made a design in the foam.... I felt like I was back in Seattle. My friends also got some dinner, but I was going out later so I passed (begrudgingly). I tried a bite of theirs, though. The roasted chicken pasta was delicious, the chicken was so flavorful and the sauce was creamy, yet light. My other friend got mashed potatoes and hummus (weird dinner). The potatoes were really good, but the hummus wasn't anything special. We also shared a bread pudding. Wow.... this was super yummy.... it has a mountain of cinnamon -y whipped cream on top..... *drool*  So Liberty market continues to be one of my fave restaurants in the valley.... everything is just so good!

This place is pretty good. They generally have a wait, but it is worth it. The scrambles are good here and very large, but not as good as the restaurant next door. The one thing that is really delicious here is the biscuits with chipped beef gravy. I've never seen this served anywhere else and it is amazing. It is so tasty, I could put that gravy on anything (though that may cause me a delicious gravy heart attack). If for nothing else, I would come here for that.

I went here for linner today as I had a groupon (yay for using up my groupons!). The BF and I got there around 3 oclock so the place wasn't so busy, there were still a few tables in there, though. They have some interesting things on their menu, but I decided to be kind of safe and got the 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad combo with the thyme chicken and goat cheese salad. They were both good, but the sandwich was better than the salad. The salad looks like they always use the same base salad and then just throw the extras that make it a 'specialty' salad on top. That was alright though. I thought the fried goat cheese was good, the balsamic that I got with it was weirdly thick, but tasted good. The chicken on the sandwich was tasty. The thing that got me was they make this huge deal out of their making their own bread, but it's not anything special. It kind of tastes like nothing.... weird. The BF got the still crazy after all these years sandwich, which is fried mozzarella and veggie (which was what I wanted! but the BF is pickier than me so I let him have it). This was pretty good too.... I mean, what isn't when it's fried? He said the sandwich would have been better had it had fried tomatoes and melted cheese instead of fried cheese.... I thought it tasted good. He got fries as his side (even though I urged him to get the mashed potato pie thing.... *sigh) and they were good, they tasted kind of beer battered. Although this place was good, I wouldn't wait in line to eat here.

I came here the other day with my mom at about 2:50. The waiter was nice enough to give us both the lunch special prices and happy hour! What a nice guy! Anyway, I have been coming here for many years and it is always good. The lunch specials are a great deal and they come with a salad with yummy gingery dressing and these wonton chips which are addictive! For the meal, I especially like their crispy noodles and their potstickers. The potstickers are really crunchy and come with both a hot chili oil and a regular potsticker sauce. They're really good, and the price can't be beat at happy hour ($2.50). They also have good lettuce wraps, kind of citrus flavored and spicy, and teppanyaki beef (a rich sweet sauce over thicker spaghetti like noodles). Although it is Americanized chinese, it is still a place I will continue to return to.

What happened Flo's? I have been coming to Flo's for many years, even had my sister in law's baby shower there (which was great and affordable!). I was in the shopping center today and decided to pick up some of their delicious wonton soup for dinner, as I have a bit of a cold, and I always liked their pork wontons, the delicious julienned ginger and carrots, the spinach, the shaved garlic....perfection for wonton soup. I got home and opened the soup....what is this?!?!?! It was like the generic wonton soup you get at any take out place or from the frozen aisle. It had thick cut carrots and 3 peas, but no other veg, no scallions, no ginger, no garlic. The wontons were like shrimp balls....I don't like shrimp and was expecting pork. This soup was not even a shadow of what I have had here before and was not good. I am so disappointed. I don't know if this is due to it being take out (which would be ridiculous) or if they ran out of their normal soup (slightly better) or they changed their soup completely to this bland garbage (worst case scenario). I was thoroughly disappointed and won't come back soon.

I went here a couple weeks ago to use a Groupon I had bought. I used to go here as a kid, and the place lived up to my memories. The bagels were dense, but in a good way, and the cream cheese was delicious. I got an everything bagel egg and cheese sandwich and that was very tasty. The BF got a blueberry bagel and liked that too. There's just something special about deli bagels and cream cheese.... nothing like ones you can get from the store. Also, these bagels were even better than Chompie's bagels have been lately, so that's a good thing.  We also had their coffee, which I thought wasn't great, but wasn't terrible. Despite this, I will definitely be back the next time I feel like a bagel.

I went to Redendo's a week or two ago after seeing a show. I had gone to Redendo's several times many years ago and always remembered it being really good! They didn't disappoint this time. I shared a calzone with the BF and it was extremely large and flavorful. You get to choose 4 toppings for the calzone and it was still under 10$. If I were in Fountain Hills I would go back, but I probably wouldn't make a special trip to eat here.

This place is awesome! I just wish I had the money to do my shopping here. I do come here whenever I can't get something at my normal supermarket, I know they'll have it here, and I haven't been disappointed yet. I especially like that they sell a lot of items in bulk (dried fruits, grains, rice, lentil, etc) So I can just get what I need and I don't need to pay for a whole package, which sometimes makes it cheaper than a less expensive store if you're looking for something specific for one recipe.   Also, the smoothie bar is super good! I love the tropical green smoothie... I could drink one everyday, except they cost 5$ so I really can't... but I would. One day when I make lots of money (ha) I'll do all of my shopping here.

Went here this morning with the BF on account of him being off of work for President's day and me not having school til this afternoon. We wanted a bagel for breakfast because we already went out to breakfast at real restaurants twice this weekend (Liberty Market and Centurion... both amazing). We were going to just go to Einsteins, but then I found this place on yelp where a lot of reviewers said these were much better than Einsteins. So I ordered the cheese and egg bagel sandwich on an everything bagel and the BF ordered a blueberry bagel with cream cheese and we both got coffee. The coffee was nothing special, DD has way better. Our food came out and looked kind of weird. The egg on the bagel was really yellow and fluffy, probably egg beaters. This sandwich had absolutely no taste. Now, an everything bagel should have flavor... cheddar cheese should have flavor. No flavor. The cheese was waxy and tasteless. The bagel was not chewy, it tasted like a slice of white bread... I don't even know how that is possible. No idea. The BF's bagel was not great, but he thought it was ok. I just cannot forgive a bagel that tastes like nothing... even after adding salt and pepper... I just couldn't save the food. I will never go back again and really I think this place is an insult to the east coast.

I went here on Friday night with my family and it was a pretty meh experience. I think outback is one of those chains where somehow they fool people into thinking their food is good, but, in reality, it isn't. They do have good bread and good caesar dressing, but all of the steaks I have had there have been mediocre at best. This particular visit was not so great because my Grandma ordered lamb chops, but they turned out to be too spicy for her, so she asked for a less spicy version and they were very nice about it...but when it came back it was raw....not so awesome. So she had to send it back again and everyone else was done with their meal before she got hers. Also, I had the teriyaki steak and it was super sweet....not something I would want again. The meat was tough and it was just covered in the sweet sauce. It came over some odd tasting rice....not great.  I got it with a sweet potato which was drowned in butter and sugar. It just isn't someplace I would want to eat again if I had a choice.

I went in here tonight with the BF. It was weird because I saw a girl I went to HS with, so that was kind of nice (if you're reading this, sorry for the not so great review... nothing to do with you). Anyway, the reason for the low stars is the coffee. I got a latte and it just wasn't that good. It was kind of watery and didn't really have any of that 'latte like' texture. It also didn't have a ton of flavor. The grande was really big, kind of expensive though. The place looked nice enough and they had a band playing, so that was kind of nice. I just wouldn't feel the need to drop 4$ on not very good coffee again. Try Cartel.... they have awesome coffee.

I went here the other day for lunch and it was very disappointing. I have been to other Manuel's locations and they have been alright, but this one was not very good. I went for lunch and got the pollo especial which is basically a chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese sauce on it. It was pretty gross, the chicken tasted like dish water and there was barely any of the jalapeno sauce on it. Also, it was really soggy, not crispy at all. I did give an extra star because our server was really nice and attentive, however, I would not come here again when there are places like top shelf that make the same dish much better.

I came here tonight with my friend on one of our worldly eating adventures. I thought it was very good! The place isn't super fancy inside or out, but the service was fine and attentive and the food was good. We shared the lamb vindaloo (spicy) and chicken tikka masala (medium) along with some rice and garlic naan. So first they brought out the indian equivalent of chips and salsa... it was a crispy thing with a green, spicy sauce and a purple sweet and spicy sauce which were both good. Then we got the food. Well, I was not a huge fan of the lamb. I thought it was spicy, but didn't have the flavors I really enjoy in Indian food. It was just kind of spicy and boring. The tikka masala was delicious, however. It was creamy and flavorful, with just a little spice. I would probably order it spicy next time. The naan was good, but nothing super special. When we were done, they brought out a little free dessert which was like a pancake puff ball soaked in syrup.... pretty good stuff. I thought the place was pretty pricy, but that's kind of the way it goes with indian food. Overall, I thought it was a good experience and I would definitely come back.

I had a little car emergency. I got in my car yesterday and it didn't start... oh no.... school was starting today and my internship is starting tomorrow.... super bad timing. So after trying to jump the battery and buying a new battery I began to freak out for a little while. I was sure that I was doomed. Then I got a recommendation to go to the Car Shop. I called them this morning at 7 am and, I think it was Terry (?), answered and just sounded to calm and assured me they could fix it. I had my car towed over there and was very nervous I wouldn't get it back til this weekend or something. Well these guys really came through... they got it done for me by this afternoon....I am so grateful to these guys! They really saved the day... plus they have a discount on the labor for ASU students! Plus they were super friendly... I would definitely give them my business again (if I ever have to... which I hope I don't!.... but you should give them your business if you have any car needs!)

I have gone here twice and both times have been good experiences, especially for the price. When I go in, I will request an advanced student, which may or may not happen, but it will increase the likelihood that it will happen. Both times I have waited less than an hour, the last time being seen almost immediately and it was a two for one day (so the massage cost 12.50...whoa. The first time I went I had a lot of pressure to do a shiatsu massage, with a lengthy explanation of what it was, but I politely declined, and I think that's what you need to do if you're looking for a full body massage and the student wants to try something different, although I do think it's cool that they offer specialty massages like that, and sometimes, I've heard, you can skip the wait if you agree to get one of the specialty massages, so that's cool too. The first time I went my student was much better than the second time, but I think it is the luck of the draw and you never know what you're going to get BUT for as inexpensive as it is, I'm willing to take that chance.   So anyway, when you get called back you go into a 'classroom' that has many stations divided by full length sheets almost (like in an emergency room), so there really is no talking with the therapist as there are many other people in the same room getting massages. This makes me feel a little awkward, but I think the therapists don't really care. I say, if you are willing to get a basic massage without any of the champagne or chocolates or whatever they give you at a spa (and save the money) this place is a great alternative. Plus, being a student clinician myself (in a different field) I know how important it is for them to get practice, so that is nice too.

The Husband and I stopped here on our way to Flagstaff a couple days ago...mainly to use their facilities, but then also to get some pie to go. The service here, as others have said, is not good. There is an area for pie slices, but no one was working there, so I went and stood in another line to ask and after waiting 10-15 min I got to the front and someone was now working the pie slice counter...was told to go over there and had to wait again, get my slice, and bring it back over to the first lady to pay....kind of ridiculous. Anyway, we got the jack daniel pecan pie and didn't eat it for a couple days. When we ate it, it was very tasty, the pecans were toasty and the crust was flaky. I wouldn't make a special trip out here to have it, but I was a fan and may get another slice on future trips up that way.

I went here last night with the BF and his parents, and overall it was a good experience. I had made a reservation for 7, but we got there at 6:30, so we had to wait. Luckily, it was happy hour! We got two margaritas (some specialty margarita with agave nectar and deliciousness), a miller lite, and a blue moon. All of that for 17$....pretty good deal. They sat us a bit before 7, so that was nice (especially because the wait time was 60-70 minutes without reservations). Our waitress was very nice and helpful. I had the delmonico steak and it was delicious! Spicy and perfectly cooked.... It came with southwest au gratin potatoes that were just ok.... The BF and his dad got prime rib, which was good (but not nearly as good as mine). His dad really likes this place because they will give you real horseradish if you request it (not just the sauce). His mom also enjoys this place despite the fact that she is a vegetarian. They are very accommodating, and she got a salad and a potato and was happy with that. Oh, and I had a 10$ off coupon they sent me for my birthday through their e mail club...so definitely sign up for that.   Despite the fact that this place is a chain, I would come back here...they have quality food.

While in Vegas over the weekend, I wanted to get off the strip for at least one meal. On my way out of town, my friend and I stopped at the Coffee Pub (as influenced by Dave H's review). This place is very homey. When you walk in, it doesn't feel like anything special, but the people who work here are very friendly and casual. We sat ourselves and were served quickly (which was great because we needed to get home). The coffee was pretty standard coffee....nothing special for a place named after it. My friend had the pumpkin pancakes, which were good, and I had the croissant egg sandwich sub over medium egg. Mine was very good, but very homey... as in, I could make this at home. That isn't necessarily a bad thing. The bacon was crispy and the eggs were cooked well. It was good. Service was great, the woman who works there (owns it?) with the short hair knew everyone's names that came in and was very friendly...offered to bring out a coffee to go for me, which I appreciated. I noticed she physically touched just about each one of the customers (not in a weird way...just in a friendly way). The prices were good. I would consider going back when in Vegas.

What a cute bar.... The bartender was extremely friendly. We went in for a friend's birthday, got a couple shots (shot of the day... something fruity- 5$) and the bartender gave us the birthday girl's shot on the house.... you really can't get better than that.... oh, except the shots were extremely tasty! I will be back.   PS the bathrooms are cute and clean :-)

I went here for lunch with my Dad and my brother today and I thought it was a really solid meal. I got the chicken picado sub with a side salad. It was really good. The sandwich was simple, just chopped up chicken, bell pepper, onion, and jalapenos, but it was very tasty. The salad has a really good dressing and the portion sizes are generous. I would definitely come back here again.

I went ot Lolo's this weekend with the Breakfast Club (thanks Monica!). It was, of course, a fun time, and the food was pretty good. I, of course, had chicken and waffles (what else?). I got the Betty Boop, which was a breast and a waffle. My waist line is not thrilled, but I was! The chicken was good, it had a good amount of crunchiness, but I wish the breading had more spices in it. A good way to fix that is using their delicious hot sauce. Surprising, the coffee here was very good as well. I will probably not come here often (my thighs can't afford it), but when I'm looking for a breakfast calorie splurge, this is a good place to go.   PS our server was very nice and accommodating for our large group.

I have been to many shows at the Orpheum. Let me start by saying that this is a beautiful theatre. It is very old school and has beautiful paintings on the ceiling. The seats are comfortable enough and the layout is such that most seats have a decent view, although the seats towards the front are slightly obstructed by the stage  (the floor isn't slanted as much as some theatres). Anyway, my main complaint with the Orpheum is they don't get enough good shows... there are rarely shows here that I feel that I would like to see. This may not be the venue's fault, but it certainly affects the frequency that I visit this theatre. The last show I saw there was Bring It On the musical (A family member asked me to go with them) and it was not good....at all.... Anyway, If there is a show you are interested in seeing at this venue, I would highly recommend it!

Ugh. Really? 4 stars? I've wanted to come here a long time... now I don't really want to come back for a long time. I wouldn't have a problem with this place if it were cheap, but I got their mai tai (out of a bucket) and it cost 6$. I can go to bitter and twisted and get a handcrafted cocktail for 6$ on happy hour (not like you can compare the bars, but that's the point). Further, my friend and I's drinks had barely any alcohol in it (you could see when looking at the jug'o'mai tai that most of the alcohol had separated to the top... not cool). Plus cash only? ugh. I can't see myself coming back here anytime soon.

This place is right by my house. I pass it all the time. Why didn't I stop in sooner? Who knows. This place is very cute inside, kind of retro...kind of reminds me of an old school Fuddruckers from when I was a kid. Also, this place has a bar! With specials! I clearly didn't realize this. Anyway, I went here last Friday and got a burger with cheddar, guac, grilled onions, and bacon... It really tasted like a backyard BBQ burger, which I liked. Nothing fancy here. The husband had a burger as well and enjoyed it. The bill was under 20$ I will definitely be back.

Now this is what I call a Vietnamese restaurant. After going to a frou frou place in the east valley a couple weeks ago, this was a welcome change. This place is very much like the pho restaurants I frequented in Seattle.... kind of small, nothing fancy looking, strong pho smell upon entering.... great. I got my free drink with check in (how awesome is that?), iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk, which was very sweet, but delicious. Certainly a treat. I had the pho tai (steak), which tasted like a high quality pho with tender thin sliced steak (it even tasted great the second day). The husband got the pork and rice lunch special, which was tasty and came with a great little salad (that I stole). Of course, we had to get an ice cream sandwich... unfortunately they were out of the Thai tea option, but we got taro cookie with pineapple/coconut ice cream.... it was refreshing and delicious. Totally worth the 3.50$ price tag (and the calories!). 43rd express, I will be back!

I went in for an oil change expecting to pay about 40$.... the man who worked there applied a coupon for me (that I didn't bring in or know about).... 23$!!! How can I complain about that? They took about an hour to change the oil, but I wasn't waiting in the waiting room, so I'm not sure if it would have been faster if they knew I was waiting. Regardless, I know where I'll be going to get oil changes from now on.

I went to Mi Patio the other night for the first time with the BF. The place is a cute little restaurant that is pretty unassuming from the outside. The salsa is spicy and fairly tasty. The service was attentive. I had the 'healthy' burro and it was very good...grilled fajita chicken and veggies. It also helped that I stole some guac from the BF's chimi...the guac added exactly what this burro needed. I would go back.

I went here tonight with my mom after much deliberation of where to get pizza. I am so glad I did! This place is too cute and very homey. Our waiter was helpful and honestly seemed to love the restaurant and the food. I had the pasta pizza....yes...you heard me right....pasta on a pizza! Not good for my diet, but VERY good for my taste buds. The pizza has penne pasta, marinara, delicious roasted garlic, and ricotta cheese. It was soooo good. My mom had the caprese pasta and really loved her food too. She said 'this is the best pasta I have ever had.' The best part? The whole meal was 20$ and I have half a pizza left over for tomorrow....awesome!

How have I not been here before?!?! I pass this place all. the. time. and have never gone in. I guess because it looks a little run down from the outside. Well, this place is shockingly cute on the inside! I met a friend here in the middle of the week for dinner and the place was hopping. We were seated right away and had no issue with service. I had to try the Thai tea after reading all the glowing reviews.... it was quite good. Maybe not super stand out from others that I've had, but good and it came in a large glass, which was nice. For food, I ordered the yellow curry and my friend had the pad see iw. I got my curry 'hot' because usually restaurants tame back the spice and it's never enough. This place did not. The curry was blazing, but delicious and full of flavor at the same time. I was happy I had the Thai tea to coat my mouth. The curry was thick, packed with potatoes, carrots, and chicken and came with a mound of rice. I ended up being able to eat it for 4 meals (big portion), and it got better each time I ate it. I definitely want to go back and try more of their food!   PS 1300!!!

Oh Da Vang, you are fabulous! I've been wanting to try this place for a long time, but I always seemed to go on the day they are closed. Anyway, I finally made it there to get some pho to go. I ordered pho ga over the phone and went to pick it up. Unfortunately, when I got there they told me they were out of chicken. Sad day. Anyway, I ended up getting some kind of beef and only waited a couple minutes for them to prepare it. The pho cost less than 5$ and when they handed me the package, it was huge! It had every item in separate containers and everything was so fresh. The beef came raw but quickly cooked in the broth (which must have been crazy hot because it was still nearly boiling when I got home). The pho was the best tasting pho I've had in Phoenix. None of that Americanized flavorless stuff you get at other places in town.  I will certainly be back!

I went to Crazy Jim's years ago, and though I liked it and it was down the street from my house, I never made it back.... that is, until yesterday. The husband and I got lunch at Crazy Jim's and it was awesome! This place has house made sauces and dressings and house baked breads... that's fabulous! I had the chicken picado pita... a fresh, hot, thick, perfect pita piled with delish grilled chicken, peppers, onions, and jalapenos... top it with the tzatziki... you don't get much better than that. Oh, and it came with a side... I chose the lemon orzo chicken soup... a huge helping of chicken soup that was fresh and fantastic. This was under 10$. Wow. The husband got the steak sandwich and fries... also fab. We definitely need to come back here, in fact, I think it's the husband's new fave place.... what are you waiting for? Try this little place... it rocks.   PS the only problem with CJ's is they don't have skordalia...... get the skordalia going and I won't even think of another Greek place.

I am really impressed with Atlasta. My friend used them to cater her wedding, which was last night, and we also chose them to cater our wedding, which is in November. We tried a lot of caterers around town, and Atlasta was by far the best and the least expensive (both good things). We went to the tasting and it was great. They made us items off of our proposed menu and it was just us at the tasting, not a big group of people. So, we put the deposit down for our wedding and were waiting for our friends' wedding to see them in action. Well, they did not disappoint. Their coordinator did a great job, she set up all the tables and made sure everything was done right. Also, the food was great. They had some chicken that was incredibly moist, especially for a buffet. They had delicious and fresh grilled veggies and a tasty pasta dish. Everything was good. This really put us at ease for our own wedding, and reassured us that we made the right choice. I'll definitely update after our wedding!

I have sat on this review for awhile... I really wanted to think it through. Like I said in my last review, Atlasta catered my wedding. I was pretty disappointed. Unlike what I had experienced previously with them, my wedding was a bit of a disaster. The person I had been working with throughout the process wasn't at the wedding.... so despite many many phone calls and e mails, things were not set up correctly. I felt totally ignored and like my time had been wasted. Unlike at my friend's wedding where they came to check with her and help her set up, no one came to check with me and I had to go looking for them (in my wedding dress!) to ask them to put something on the tables... people saw me before the ceremony... not cool. The food served was not the food discussed throughout the planning process. Items were missing sauces, salads that were supposed to be served as salad 'tacos' were served in a bowl. Our whole idea of small plates and stations was not pulled off due to their poor presentation and their disregard for what we had talked about previously. I didn't get to eat much, but what I ate was not at the level I had expected. We were supposed to have grilled cheese with tomato soup shots.... the tomato soup was missing for most of the night... the grilled cheese was cold and flavorless. I think the worst thing was that we spoke to them extensively about having to have vegan and vegetarian options for our guests that were labeled.... we had a vegetarian mac and cheese that was supposed to be served with bowls of toppings for the people to add themselves.... the mac and cheese was labeled vegetarian, but not only were there no bowls of toppings, but they put bacon in it!!!! This is unacceptable for my vegetarian guests.... Additionally, they forgot to put out a knife for us to cut the cake with... so we used a butter knife... nice. Anyway, there were many other disappointing aspects to this company, but I won't get into it. I would not recommend them for your special day...they certainly put a damper on mine.

This place is awesome. I've taken my puppy here twice for vaccinations and both times the people were just so nice and friendly. I called and made an appointment, which gives you an hour and a half slot of time to come in...once you get there, you are put on the list and it is first come first serve...so you will have to wait awhile. The doctor there treated my puppy like gold and the price was also right. I would recommend to anyone for vaccinations.

This place is huge. They have so many antiques, it's almost overwhelming. I would say the prices are generally pretty good, but not as inexpensive as some other antique places. I have found some treasures here, but many times I leave empty handed. Despite this, I would definitely recommend the Brass Armadillo...you never know what you're gonna get!

The Humane Society has been my go to place for pet adoption over the years. I got both of my cats from the Humane Society, and they both are wonderful. I like that they provide a vet visit and a bag of quality food with adoption. Additionally, I like that their volunteers/staff are friendly and have seemed to be knowledgeable and the animals are kept in individual small cages or in large enclosures with 2-3 animals. The cats I have adopted have been wonderful, in good health, and seem to have been taken care of in their (extensive) time at the Humane Society. Both cats were lonely hearts (had been in the shelter for months) and had nominal adoption fees (5$ and 20$... wow). Both had been spayed and received medical attention. When it is time to adopt another furry friend, this will definitely be the place to go.

Sighhhh. I have been to other Waffle House locations, and I am the first to admit I am not a fan. Despite this, I agreed to go to Waffle House because the husband wanted to and it was 4 in the morning. I can say this will be my last trip (especially at this location). The booths were all dirty and sticky. The food came out wrong (I got a choco chip waffle....no choco chips...solution? they just out some on top. wow. The husband got covered hashbrowns....they had onions in them, he doesn't like onions....fail). In addition to being wrong, the food was absolutely disgusting. I'm not sure if it's the oil they use or that the cooktop was dirty or what, but I had a couple bites and was done. I had the biscuit egg, bacon, and cheese sandwich and the waffle. The sandwich was greasy and tasted like chemicals. The egg was overcooked. The waffle tasted terrible...also chemically....I just don't even know if this was food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

The BF and I went to Mi Comida with the International Supper Club this past week and it was an interesting experience. I was so excited to come here because I spent time in South America this past summer and it's hard to find good South American food in Phoenix. This restaurant serves Bolivian food and other South American foods, so there is a nice variety. The restaurant itself is small and our group took up a good portion of the entire place. The service is slow, but that's a good thing, because you know they are making the food fresh for you. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food, I know we did. I will say, this food was lacking a little in the spice department....I got the aji sauce, which is very spicy in Peru, but was not spicy here. The BF and I shared 3 different empanadas with different fillings....the one with the potato and cheese was amazing, the beef ones were good and the verde were alright. We also got two tamales (pork and potato I think), which were tasty and well made and a side of maduros which were sweet and delicious, in addition to not being burnt like they often are when served at Cuban restaurants. I would recommend this restaurant if you are in the area!

I went here last night with some friends and enjoyed it! I had a giant blue moon (since it was the blue moon and all...)...and it was big. The bear was like 24 oz. That thing was heavy! I had the baked ziti for dinner and it was pretty delicious....hot and bubbly and super cheesy. I tasted some of my friends wing sauce (the spicy and sweet special sauce...forgot the name) it was super delicious. I would definitely go back here again!

Ok so I am officially a gross person. I did eat at top shelf twice within a week and a half. BUT it was totally worth it. This location is so much better than the mesa location. The chicken fajita burrito fundido was delicious! as per usual. I only gave 4 stars because the rest of their food doesn't measure up and it is too expensive for what you get. Still good though (especially with a coupon).

This place looks very cute inside, but, unfortunately, the food just wasn't that great when I went here for lunch today with a friend. The chips and salsa weren't very good, the chips were stale and the salsa wasn't very flavorful. I ordered a burro with the pork, that someone raved about, but thought it was just ok, a little dry and kind of boring in flavor. My friend got a beef burro combo and the beef was extremely dry and was super peppery, not so good. Also, the rice was bland.... Finally, the service was slow and a bit awkward... like the waitress came and asked us about drinks and then brought the drinks all without giving us a menu... kind of strange.  I probably wouldn't come back here.

This place is....odd. As you walk in, you may feel like you've gone to the wrong place, as it looks like your typical liquor store, but they have a very small bar in the basement. I came here with a friend and sat with a couple other people at the tiny bar. The bar tender was friendly and helpful, offering samples of beers and conversing about restaurants with me at length. They have a nice variety of beers that change from time to time and they also have wine. It doesn't have your typical bar atmosphere... it's very quiet and intimate, but it's a nice place to go try some new beers.

I went here to get an oil change today and it was great! I love that you can schedule appointments online and see exactly how much you will be paying when you get there (also, look for coupon codes....can save some money). The oil change was inexpensive and the guys who worked there were friendly. They got it done in a little less than an hour, which I am completely satisfied with after my debacle with Meineke a few months back where I was there for around 4 hours...with them being right around the corner, why not give them the business?   Note: their parking lot is on the south side of the building and cannot be accessed from the north side (I found that out the hard way :-P)

This is classic Americanized Mexican food... super cheesy, mostly fried, and fully delicious. They start you with chips and 2 salsas - green and red, which are both mild and kind of sweet. Now, if you ask for it, you can get a tasty 'hot' salsa, which I liked much better than either of the original salsas. I had a cheese crisp and beef taquitos. The cheese crisp was more crispy and more cheesy than most.... it was a fabulous thing. The taquitos were fairly average, but also covered in melty cheese... overall, nothing special, but tasty. The husband enjoyed his bean and cheese burrito. The bill was under 20$... can't complain about that!

*note* this is a preliminary review. I purchased my wedding gown from Suzanne's about five months ago and they have been great so far. This store was the only one that had the perfect gown (I looked at a few places in town). They had a large selection of lots of different types of dresses, all shapes and styles, and they have trunk shows here often so you can see even more dresses. My gown came in to the store last week and I went to try it on today. The ladies there were helpful and Heather is too funny. My only complaint is that I called them back after being notified that my gown was in, and the girl who answered the phone had no knowledge of the store. I asked her if I needed an appointment to come try on the dress and she replied 'Do you want an appointment?' ......I don't know...... do I NEED an appointment??? This girl was ridiculous, can't remember who it was. Anyway, she told me I didn't need an appointment, but I figured I would double check this morning and the girl who was there then told me that I did need one. This girl should probably not be answering the phone. Anyway, this complaint is minor and I would definitely recommend Suzanne's for your wedding gown needs.  PS I will update after the wedding to let you know how their follow through is and how the dress turned out in the end!

I went to the Ren Fest yesterday for the first time since high school. When I was in high school, I went to the Ren Fest every year and got fully dressed in costume. My musts included: Henna tattoo, new jewelry (preferably with a dragon or sword on it),  and hair braiding. Well, the Fest is very much the same now. It has a lot of the same shows, rides, booths, and food that it always has had. I have a changed a bit (only got the hair braids this time since I am old enough for real tattoos :-P). This was my first time at the fest in which I could drink, so that was awesome. Their drinks are fairly priced, Guinness is 5$, mead is 4$, mixed drinks are about 6$. I started with honey mead...seemed like the right thing to do....this stuff is pretty freakin awful. The mead is so sweet, it kind of tasted like cold medicine....yikes. I had to slam it. The beer was good, and I got a daiquiri that was very large and tasty. The people watching here is pretty wonderful, you can see many scantily clad women, men in all kinds of costumes, and I even saw a guy with a sword and shield made of PBR cans.....pretty epic stuff. The shows are all included, there are some free games scattered around (we played giant Jenga), and lots of crafty things to look at. I will definitely return to the Ren Fest and if you have never gone, I would highly recommend it.

I came here with a friend for Restaurant week last Saturday night. The restaurant week deal is amazing, the meal I had would have been extremely expensive had it not been RW and I got to try a variety of menu items. I had to try the Stetson Chop Salad, as it is the signature dish... it was pretty delish. I liked all of the different flavors and textures, it was sweet, herbacious, salty, crunchy, chewy....pretty much a little bit of everything. I then had the scallops... very tasty, crunchy scallops served over a bacon risotto... I would definitely get this again. For an entree I had the lamb lollipops... these were good, but a little overcooked (they were supposed to be medium rare and were more like medium well...). I wouldn't get this again. My friend had the pastrami short rib, which was tasty, but a little odd. I probably wouldn't order that either. The desserts were nothing special.... we had the hawaiian bread pudding, which was dry, and the peanut butter bar, which was good but lacked any creativity. I would go back for the scallops and that delicious chopped salad!

I do not get it Yelp! I was so mislead by this place. I took the BF here for his *official* birthday dinner and it was a massive disappointment. The menu looks really good and the restaurant looks ok... kind of big and Houston's -ish. We were sat at one of the 'chef's tables' a table right next to the kitchen. That was kind of cool.. lots of yelling. Our server was really not good, he was extremely slow and inattentive. It took him a long time to come around, and when he did he only wanted to take drink orders. We wanted to drink water, and he didn't seem too happy with that. He walked off. Anyway, we finally ordered and I got the fried chicken and the BF got the short ribs (which he was really excited for) and we got the green chili mac and cheese due to the good reviews of it. Then we waited for a very long time. When the food came out, mine had a sauce on it that was congealed and looked really gross. The chicken itself was nothing special.... they used a really thick cut boneless breast and it was really dry. The mashed potatoes that came with it tasted like nothing.... totally flavorless. ugh. The BF's short ribs were also very meh. They were bone in (really? they couldn't take the bone out for 25$ hmmm). They also didn't render all of the fat so they had massive amounts of fat on them. Yuck. In addition, they had very little flavor... you would think something braised in Dr. Pepper would be delicious... not the case. Again, it was totally bland. Furthermore, the mac and cheese was really not good either. The first bite tasted ok, but as it went on, it tasted like kraft singles with chile peppers. yum? not so much. So we wanted to get cake, it being the BF's birthday and all.... but nothing on the dessert menu looked very good and honestly we were scared to get a dessert after the food being so lackluster. I will never go back here.

Let me start by saying whatever happened to cooking Christmas dinner? I am Jewish, so for me Christmas= Chinese food, but apparently the secret is out. I went here tonight with the BF. We had made reservations for 7:30 and arrived at 7:20. The place was clearly understaffed as the two hostesses were running around like crazy acting as waitresses and bussers in addition to trying to host. As we stood there waiting for our table, about half of the tables in the restaurant left. You would think that this would make for a quick seating....surprise! It didn't. We waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. Additionally, several tables who did not have reservations were seated at the same time as us, which would have been fine if there were people working at this restaurant, but there weren't. So the BF and I sit there. The couple (without res) gets water, some small family that was seated at the same time gets water....we get nothing. The waitress comes around and takes their orders. Nothing. The family gets their appetizers and the waitress comes and takes their main entree order. Nothing. The other table gets their beers and sushi...still nothing! The hostess finally came by after at least twenty minutes and took our orders....we still do not have water. For real. And the place has gotten significantly less busy at this point. So we order the tangerine chicken and the pad kee mao with a 7/10 spiciness. We waited and waited. The other couple received entrees and just about finished them before we got our food. It was like we were in an episode of Seinfeld or something. The service was that bad.   We (finally) get our food and I will admit, the tangerine chicken was tasty. It was sweet and savory...pretty good. The problem is it was luke warm...like it had been sitting for awhile. Not cool. The pad kee mao was a disaster. First, it had about a 1-2 star spiciness level. Not spicy....at all. Second, in addition to not being spicy it was bland and kind of tasted like dishwater. Third, the veggies were still essentially raw. The dish was terrible. I have had much better (real) Thai food for a fraction of the price. We barely touched the dish, but no one showed us any concern or asked if our food was alright. The entire ordeal lasted one and half hours...for just entrees and water. Overall, the experience was terrible.   I know what you're thinking....But Jennifer, it's Christmas!... Yes, I know it's Christmas, but I don't care, it isn't an excuse. I made a reservation. If they they did not have the space, they should have A) not given us a reservation or B) not let in walk ins when they had reservations. Whoever owns this restaurant should have put more thought into staffing for a night that they KNEW would be busy because they took reservations! It was unacceptable. The place only got a second star because the tangerine chicken was good, but I would be hesitant to go here again because apparently my business means nothing to this restaurant.

After being on my bookmark list for possibly years, I finally tried this place a few weeks back.... and it was good! The décor is a little hokey, what with it looking like a cave and being extremely dark, but it was cute. I went with my dad and we shared a green chili burger and a sampler plate (the enchantment platter) that had a chile relleno, enchilada, and a carne adovada burrito. The burger was so so... really nothing special and not a lot of heat there, but the enchantment platter.... that thing was huge, delicious, and covered in gooey cheese. There wasn't a bad item on it. Everything was spicy and flavorful, it makes me want another one as I type about it. There was more than enough food, so I had leftovers, which were equally delicious the next day. I'll be back.    PS they have a great looking happy hour here, would love to go back and try that!

I went back here last night with my mom as last time we went my mom asked for half of her burger in a doggie bag and when she got home it wasn't in the bag, so my mom called and talked with Chris who is the manager (?), and he was so sweet and told her to come back and he'd give her another burger on the house. So we went, we got the coconut shrimp, which aren't like I remember them from when I was a kid, but I liked them and I normally don't like shrimp at all. I ordered a double baked (droool.... this is the best item at this restaurant.... all bacon -y and delicious and a house salad which was just ok, but what do you expect, it's a house salad. We also got a slice of chocolate cake that comes with fudge.... the fudge... mmmmmmmm sooooo good! That was definitely a good choice. Chris really went the extra mile to give us really good customer service and we really appreciate that. I guess that is what makes this restaurant stand out.

I went here last Friday night and it is a very solid bar! They have cheap drinks that are very tasty. The ambiance is divey but cute. We sat out on the patio (got there early enough - around 9 ish - to get a place to sit) and it was comfortable. The place got very busy about an hour after we got there, but we still had fine service at the bar. I would definitely come back here again.

So my brother is getting married and we had the rehearsal dinner here last night. It was so nice! I had no idea that they had a bunch of party rooms in the back of this restaurant. They're very cute. So the party went well and everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful. The food was good, especially the salads (caeser, house, and caprese) and the artichoke dip. Yum, I would go back to eat those again. The pizza was just ok, we had a bunch of different types, but I just didn't think they were anything too special. I thought the pepperonis tasted kind of weird, maybe just not what I was used to. The plain cheese pizza was really good, so I'd probably just go for that if I came back. Also, parking is a bit difficult in the area, they have a lot but it is really small. We had to park a few blocks away and walking in heels was not so pleasant. That's not really the restaurant's fault though, it's kind of the nature of the area.

Let me start by saying that Elements pretty much set the bar for a special occasion destination. This place really bends over backwards for your special occasion, and that has not gone unnoticed. Elements is located on Camelback mountain, has a gorgeous view (especially at sunset), and is headed by chef Beau MacMillan (of food network fame). When we arrived, we decided to self park, which is actually quite a trek up to the restaurant in the maze that was the Sanctuary hotel, but it was pretty and we didn't mind the walk. We were greeted upon arrival and they promptly said 'happy anniversary!' (I had noted it in the res). We were shown to our table, which was facing a full wall window and was covered in rose petals... nice touch guys! Our waiter was attentive, but a little odd... I can't put my finger on it, but he seemed a little too 'put on,' this was not a big deal though.  I decided to start with a cocktail and was swayed to try the honeydew/ cucumber/gin concoction by the waiter, describing it as a sweet drink. Well... this drink was basically gin over ice.... it wasn't fabulous, but it was decent, and had enough gin in it to warrant the 14$ price tag.   We ordered the lobster bisque to share to start. They brought the soup in two bowls for us... very nice. The soup was good, but not great. The lobster was a bit cold and the bisque was made with coconut milk.... which was interesting, but didn't have the richness of a traditional bisque. The bread they serve, however, is delicious... crusty, flavorful, and warm, served with salted butter... yum.   For entrees I had the bacon wrapped filet which came with some polenta, onion, and mushrooms (45$), the husband had the prime new york strip which came with a bunch of braised greens (and bacon) and was topped with a huge roasted parsnip (48$), and we split the truffle mac and cheese side (which was super expensive at 17$). My filet was tasty, but the bacon wrapping seemed unnecessary. The filet itself was delicious and the mushrooms were nice and tender. The husband's steak was decidedly better, very juicy and flavorful. The parsnip was very good, but the star was the sauce and greens.... they were perfectly savory, well seasoned, and complemented the meat. The mac and cheese was good... but maybe not as good as it was expensive (I will say though that I had most of it for lunch the next day as leftovers mixed with the greens from the husband's steak and the bacon... it was really good like this).   The restaurant was nice enough to bring us dessert on the house and decorate the plate with chocolate saying ' happy anniversary' ... Like I said... they went all out. The dessert was a lemon tart with gelato and fried herbs... it was pretty delicious.   Take home point: I would come back here, but only for very special occasions (this place is pretty crazy expensive). The food was very good, but maybe not as good as it was pricey.

I came to Toyama with a couple friends who had heard good things about their food from a friend who had recently been to Japan. It was a bit out of the way, but we were excited to try it. The restaurant is small but cute. We were seated in their enclosed patio (arizona room?), which had the nice feeling of being outside without actually being outside. We tried many menu items- agadashi tofu, asparagus, veggie tempura roll, tuna roll, gyoza, and the beef over rice appetizer. I'm sorry to say, nothing was that delicious or memorable. Most of the food was very plain and nothing special, especially for the price. The asparagus was served plain with a little sesame seed on top. The rolls were fine, but not amazing. One of the people in our party had a roll he said was tasty, but I didn't try that one. The beef over rice was one of the biggest disappointments. The beef was this thin fatty mangled beef web... Like a thin slice gone terribly wrong... It looked unappetizing. The sauce had no flavor... It was one of the most bland and boring dishes I have had in a long while, which was especially sad for the 12$ price tag. Other restaurants give you steak in a bowl for about the same price. When I asked the waiter about the difference between the beef I got and another beef on the menu he said 'they're the same beef, the sauce comes out of the same packet...' really? Your sauce comes out of a packet...super glad I'm paying 12$ for that. Additionally, our waters were never refilled and we were checked in once throughout the meal. We spent over 70$ for a wholly disappointing experience. Wouldn't be back, wouldn't recommend.

I went here yesterday with some friends and we all liked it. We all shared an order of half garlic spread and half roasted red pepper hummus. Both were really good, although now I feel like I can't wash the garlic smell off of my skin, but worth it I guess. I got the chicken pita and it was flavorful. I don't think this place is any better or worse than other places like it, but It's convenient to me and it was pretty good. I'd go again.

I can't believe I forgot to review this place! I went a couple months ago with a friend. We were both a little worried that we wouldn't like it, especially because I had Ethiopian food once before and didn't love it. Well, I did end up liking this alright (not my favorite, but definitely not bad). I asked the waitress for her suggestion and she seemed a little exasperated with me (but what do you expect?). At her suggestion, I got the Key Sega Wat (spicy beef stew) and the Misir Wat (spicy lentils). Both had a lot of flavor, but neither was really spicy, which disappointed me. I don't know how soon I would go back here, but if I did ever feel like Ethiopian food again, I would give this place another shot.

Um...yes please! This is one of those cases where the idiom 'you can't judge a book by its cover' really applies. This place looks awful from the outside...like a place you would never want to go, BUT do not be fooled! I went here yesterday with my dad and brother for the lunch buffet and it was killer! There was a wide variety of dishes including chicken tikka masala (my fave dish), a spinach curry, a vegetarian meatball in curry, a stewed goat dish (which was Ah mazing), and even desserts and chai tea. They also come around and bring naan to your table. All for like 9$ per person! The food here I thought was really really good, and for the price you can't beat it. I've paid double or more to eat at some other Indian restaurants around tempe, and I can honestly say that this was just as good, if not better, than those places (plus the variety of a buffet is nice). I will be back here for sure!

The BF and I went here tonight after getting a Groupon for this store (40$ for 80$..pretty sweet). We got there about 10 minutes before closing, which was very rude of us, but the people who were working there didn't seem to mind and still gave us outstanding service! So much so that the woman who worked there offered to gift wrap a pair of shoes for us...even when we kept them late. The place has a good selection of comfortable and specialty shoes and I like supporting a local business. Give this place a shot the next time you need a nice pair of shoes!

So.... this place has some seriously tasty pizza. I picked up a pizza from here the other day and it was very good, it was a saucy pizza, which is the way I prefer it, and the sauce was very flavorful, a little sweet, but not too sweet. The crust also had a lot of flavor and was the perfect golden brown color. Oh, and be sure to visit their website and look at the coupons, there are some great deals! We got a 16 inch pepperoni for 12$ and had half a pizza left over to eat the next day. Yum.   I will definitely be back.... and to try the pastry one of these days.... mmmm

Oh yelpers....you steered me wrong this time.... I went to Haji Baba yesterday with a friend after having a friend recommend it in addition to having great yelp reviews. Let me say, it was not so awesome. My friend went to wash her hands and said the bathroom was one of the most disgusting bathrooms she had ever seen in a restaurant. We both got the chicken shwarma plate with the garlic sauce...the plate was large, but the food on it was not very good. The chicken was some of the worst quality I have had in a long time....having cartilage and other chewy grossness.... The garlic 'sauce' was more like mayo...really gelatinous. The rice was just plain white rice, the hummus was ok....pretty generic, the tabbouleh was almost all parsley, barely any grains or tomato.....it just was not so pleasant. I would not go back for sure.

I went here last night with the BF cuz it was 10 pm and we hadn't eaten anything yet. The pizza is not flavorful, it's greasy and it wasn't heated up enough. If I wanted reheated flavorless pizza, I can make a frozen one at home and it would be much less expensive. Plus the place feels grungy and dirty. I used to like this place 5 years ago.... but sorry slices, not my thing anymore.

I CANNOT believe I haven't reviewed this place! I wasn't going to review this place for my experience last night (which was pretty par) because I assumed I had reviewed before, but apparently not. Anyway, Macayo's as a whole is somewhat a blight on society. I know that is a little strong, but it really is not good and not authentic and just not a place where people should eat ever if they have the option. I have been to this location several times (always against my will....I have a friend that really likes it...not sure how that is possible and went to grad school at ASU, so hard to avoid). Anyway, the few times I have had dishes with meat in them from this restaurant are by far the worst times. Their meat is horrible. It has a disgusting texture and is completely devoid of flavor. So meat is definitely out when eating here (that is probably safer for your health anyway....I am just imagining a Kitchen Nightmares type scenario behind the scenes at this place). The food that does not contain meat is significantly less disgusting, albeit pretty bland. Their one saving grace is their baja sauce (sweet cream cheesy sauce) which is obviously tasty, but so terrible for you it is hard to eat in good conscious (but sometimes.....let's just say it happens). So last night I got a cheese crisp, which is pretty unmessupable and it was fine, although it had several random food items on it that obviously fell onto it from other plates (some lettuce, a small piece of chicken, etc)....nice touch. I had their 'special' Marg which was actually pretty good (it was Grand Marnier and tequila), but when I got the bill it was still 9$, so it did not appear to actually be on special (or it is an incredibly overpriced drink to begin with). That brings me to another complaint....this place is WAY overpriced. Like, an entree costs 12$ at least and is lower quality than Filiberto's. The entrees are also way WAY too big....they should probably offer half or quarter size portions for less (although the food isn't good anyway, so it doesn't really matter). So why 2 stars and not 1? This place is a decent place to drink if you are into premixed type alcohol, but they have a good happy hour and the baja sauce is good, so I can't justify a 1 star BUT if I had it my way, I would never eat at a Macayo's again ever.

I have had pizza from here a few times, with mixed results, but generally positive. I usually get thin crust, which I like very much, but tonight we got a thick crust.... I wasn't a fan, but the BF really enjoyed it. I thought it was too bread -y. We also got some garlic bread with tomatoes, mozz, and basil.... This was super delicious! I could just eat this for a meal.... probably a really unhealthy meal that will leave me smelling of garlic for a few days..... but it's totally worth it.    So this location is a cute little hidden restaurant. The people are always friendly when I have gone to pick up, but I haven't eaten in the restaurant. I also really like that I can order online.... since I hate talking to people on the phone and all. So go Spinato's!

This was stop 2 for my friends and I's awesome pre St Patty's Day drinking times. There was no line outside at about 10:15 ish. We got fireball shots for 3$ which is a good deal IMO, but other than that it was not so good. The slushies were a little on the gross side, too sweet. I got the strawberry marg and it was just too syrupy and too expensive for what you get (like 8$ for a 'large' which is not that large). The music was fine and the dancing was fun, but I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite bars.

Ok, so I discussed it with my dad, and decided to give this place four stars ( I was going to give it five stars, but he convinced me that it wasn't 'special' enough to get five stars and then I decided that I would need to go again before making that decision.   Anyway, I met my dad here for lunch yesterday at around 11:30 and the place had some customers, but wasn't crazy busy. We sat outside, and that was very nice. We decided to split the caesar salad with chicken and the chicken sandwich with the goat cheese and fig jam. The caesar was really good, the dressing tasted excellent and was tossed perfectly, and the chicken was also very flavorful, but the whole thing still had a light quality to it. It was tasty. The sandwich was also very good. I could taste each ingredient, which I like, the bread was good, crispy but soft at the same time, and the combo of flavors was really great. Also, the service was excellent, my water was never empty.   So I would most definitely come back here. I just think I need to try dinner here and some more complex dishes than what I got before I can give it five stars, but honestly, as far as sandwich places go, I liked this very much, better than pane bianco.

So let me start by saying that when I lived in Seattle I ate thai food all the time. So I wanted to try some of the top rated thai food in phoenix.I went here for lunch today with some friends, and it was pretty good. The place was busy, but we were seated right away. The waitress promptly brought out little cups of soup (which was really yummy). A couple of my friends ordered the Phad see ew, another got the red curry, and I got the spicy noodles. Everyone liked their food, my only problem was that I ordered my spicy noodles 'hot.' They were not spicy at all. Like not even a little bit. So... maybe they were confused. The noodles were still good, I liked them, but they had absolutely no heat. Oh well, I guess I would go back, I'm curious to see what the food would taste like if it were spicy. I tried my friend's curry, which was a medium, and it was good. Also, all the lunch specials were reasonably priced at 6.95.

Ok...so I have been back a few times and I have a serious problem with this place. They will not make my food spicy. For real. I order hot and the food is bland and lacking any sort of spice....it makes no sense! I have gotten the spicy noodles each time which is a misnomer because the noodles have never once been spicy...at all. After visiting several other thai food places around phoenix I have realized that this one is one of the worst...sad to say. It just doesn't have the flavor that other restaurants have....sorry thai basil.

Ok, so this week the BF and I decided to do a little comparison. We ate at Classic Italian Pizza on Tues. night, as we had a Groupon (yay!), and then went to Pizzeria Bianco on Wed night. We got to this restaurant a bit late (9 pm) and it was pretty empty, just one other table who were finishing up. I ordered a red sangria, which was very good, and the bf got a good beer that was Croatian... interesting. We decided to get two pizzas, a margherita pizza and a garlic and basil pizza because we couldn't compromise on any of the more fancy pizzas, but did agree that we wanted to try something with sauce and something without. They were both alright, but not as good as I expected from the reviews. The margherita was a little disappointing because it was just like a cheese pizza.... I expect the margherita to have islands of mozz and sliced tomatoes... this was just like a plain cheese pizza. It still tasted fine. The garlic was better, in my opinion. It was very garlicky and the cheese was tasty. We finished with the tiramisu which was good, but again, not the best I've ever had. (I guess better than Bianco, since they don't even have that as an option...) The tiramisu was melty and you could really taste the alcohol which was good at first, but a bit too strong as we got to the end of the dessert. So overall, sorry guys, I gotta say Bianco was better.... but this is a great alternative if you don't want to wait for hours and or are in mesa. I will actually be more likely to return here than Bianco because of the wait and my location....

I went here today with my supervisor and it was very good! This place was packed...like standing room only. When a table opened shortly before we got our food it was a sweet victory. This place was much better than pei wei for sure. I ordered the pan fried noodles with chicken and it was very tasty.The sauce was all garlicky and delicious and it had a lot of veggies (broccoli, snow peas, carrots, mushrooms, etc), which is a big plus. The noodles were just ok, but what can you expect from a fast place, plus it's awesome that they offer this crispy noodle option to begin with!  My supervisor got the lemon chicken and was excited that they offer brown rice. Overall, it was good and I would go back for sure.

I have been coming here for years, but just picked it up for dinner tonight and thought I would review. This place is excellent! The food is fresh and the service is so nice. The owner is usually there and she remembers my bf and I when we come in (which isn't that often considering we live in mesa... but totally worth the drive). I usually get pasta of varying forms (Lasagna, ravioli, manicotti) and it is always good. It comes with salad, garlic bread, and a drink for less than 10$! That is amazing! I only wish they were closer so I could go here more often. Their pizza is also really good, but I haven't tried the sandwiches yet. If you want to have great italian food with fabulous service for a real steal go to Submarinos!

I can't believe I haven't updated my review for this place in 2 years! Well in that time I have come here several times and have brought family here. I found the key to liking this restaurant....the eggs florentine. This is way better than their omelets, the hollandaise is good and the mushroom, tomato, and spinach that is on the bene is fresh and delicious. The service is always good and the coffee is also always tasty. I like that they serve their coffee in glass cups so you can watch the coffee mix with the creamer....I know, kind of odd, but try it....it's very entertaining! This place is definitely worth a try.

I know I seem like a crazy person who can't make up my mind on this restaurant, but I think I'm done with it. Went here a few more times in the last 6 months or so, the eggs florentine went south.... eggs not cooked correctly, hollandaise was gluey... produce not so fresh. Went last weekend, got two eggs and bacon with potatoes. The eggs were cooked well but flavorless... the whole plate was flavorless. I broke up pieces of bacon and mixed it with the potatoes and put the eggs on top.... still not good. The potatoes were undercooked, crunchy still, and had no seasoning whatsoever, it was just a bland pile of grease... yuck. On top of that, we waited over 30 minutes for a table. I don't think I'll be back, there are too many good breakfast places around to continue to go to a bad one.   PS The service here continues to be very friendly, so that is a plus.

I am so thankful to North Valley Mechanical! My AC went out on Friday night, making for an extremely unpleasant night trying to sleep in a 90+ degree house. I literally slept on the concrete floor... desperate times people. Anyway, I put in a request with my home warranty company for service and got back some other AC company that got 1 star reviews... uh, not gonna happen. I called and requested a change in contractor and ended up with N. Valley. Anyway, I called them at 8 am on a Saturday - they aren't technically open, but have a line for emergencies. Called that number and they had someone out at my house by 2 PM.... I was so grateful. The mechanic was professional and said it was an easy fix. He fixed the AC in about 20 minutes.... hooray! I haven't been billed yet, so hopefully it only costs the call fee from the warranty company, but the service I received was excellent. Would recommend.

Jake's is a great little place to have your car worked on. I have gone here a couple times and the BF has gone here a few times, including today, for various car issues. Jake is a good guy who does good auto work. He is very honest and has fair pricing. This guy also really knows what he's doing when it comes to cars. I would recommend him for auto work to anyone.

The BF and I stayed here this past weekend because we booked last minute and this was the cheapest option at 70$ per night. Let me start by saying, although this place isn't bad, I never want to stay here again. The room was fine, but the bed was old and uncomfortable and the bathroom had random hairs all over....the cleaning was pretty far from thorough. My main complaint, though, is although they have a shuttle to the strip, it ends at 9 pm....so obviously, we had to cab back....and the cab ride cost 35$....whoa. There goes the savings. I can see staying here with a family as they do have a lot of things all under one roof....movies, bowling, casino, restaurants, and even an animatronic show....It's just not for me.

The BF and I stayed here using his parents' timeshare. It was great! The location was perfect, very convenient and close to other hotels and casinos. It was quiet and our one bedroom villa was huge! We had a giant tub with jets...jets! The bed was large and comfortable and we also had a full kitchen. The place has a small rooftop pool and hot tub that are very nice and were, for the most part, not very busy. We had a great stay and would definitely come back!

I stayed at the Excalibur the last time I was in Vegas because I was meeting friends and this is where they chose to stay. Ugh. I do not know what is wrong with them. This hotel/casino is not cool. It was very expensive (160$ a night... what?) and the first room we went into smelled like someone poured water all over the floor and let mold grow for a few weeks. After over an hour, they gave us another room which was fine, but still overpriced. The casino is in a bad location, so far from the central strip. Who wants to go to New york New york? cuz that's about the only place that is close to this hotel, oh and the MGM. All of the food in this casino is bad. Overall, I was not happy that we had to stay at this hotel. Never again.

Whoa... This place is so good! We came here with no reservations and they sat us no problem. We had trouble deciding on which restaurant we should eat at, but we definitely made the right decision. This place is so nice, the waiters are very professional. We got some delicious leek soup as an amuse bouche. This was so good, I wanted to lick the little cup. We got an array of really good breads with sea salt, olive oil, butter, and other herbs. Ohhh so good. I ordered the new york steak, which was excellent! It came with this crazy potato cheese fondue stuff that was unlike anything I've ever had before. My boyfriend's food was even better than mine though. He got the braised short ribs. They had this delicious sauce on them that had mustard flavor and was a little spicy. It was served on top of some of the lightest most fluffy gnocchi I have had. I want to go eat there every time i'm in vegas.

'Why am I here?' was the thought running through my head after walking 3+ casino lengths to get there. Oh ya, 50$ free play I got from the ridiculous time share presentation I attended....should've known that would be a joke. Can only use the voucher on machines that don't pay you any winnings and are straight up slots....was wanting to play on video poker....nope, not an option. Also, was not approached by a waitress at all. I should have known better....definite fail for me.

Ok, as much as I want to give this place 5 stars.... I just can't. The wait is just too ridiculous. So I think this place plays psychological tricks on it's patrons. People have to wait so long that they either go get drunk or get so hungry that the food tastes amazing once you finally get it..... plus people need to justify the wait. But alas, I have fallen for their tricks. We got there at 4:45 and had to park in the garage which has validation ,but not complete validation, it still costs 5$ (Lame!). We found the restaurant by looking for a mob of people. We got in the 30 min line to put our name on the waiting list... whoa. When we got up to the front we found out the wait would be 3.5 hours, but at least we didn't have to stay the whole time. I think that is the best possible thing this business has done. If I had to sit there for 3 hours, I would not have been a happy camper, but we went to Body World and came back and only had to wait 15 min, so that was great. Also our wait wasn't really 3.5 hours, it was more like 2 hours 45 min. Whatever. So we got some drinks at the bar and then got called in to a table. The waitress was nice and very apologetic about the wait, so at least this restaurant knows to be courteous to it's customers unlike a different restaurant I recently went to *cough*postino*cough* There were four of us and we ordered two appetizers and two pizzas. We got the roasted veggies with cheese and sopprasetta (sp?) and the fontina wrapped in prosciutto. They were both amazing!! This was the best part of the meal. The veggies included purple cauliflower, carrots, squash, asparagus, sunchokes, and olives. They were sooo good. Roasted and kind of sweet. These were some of the best veggies I have had. Also the cheese, I don't remember what kind it was, was so creamy... it tasted great on bread. However, nothing touched the fontina wrapped in prosciutto. I have not had prosciutto before because I don't like bacon.   Yes, I don't like bacon.  But I was being so closed minded because prosciutto is delicious. And this was especially good, it could have only been better if there were more of it. The BF and I ordered the biancoverde and our friends got the wiseguy. I didn't try theirs, but our was very good. It was garlicky, but the flavor was more subtle than it usually is. The three cheeses were great and the arugula tasted very fresh.   So the problems include: long wait and no dessert. Why doesn't this place have dessert? (oh except for biscotti... biscotti is a weak dessert choice). The rest was good and if someone were to invite me to go back, I would, but I probably wouldn't go back on my own.

I went back to Durant's last night for my anniversary because the BF really wanted to try it. They totally redeemed themselves. We had a fabulous dinner! They brought out that delicious leek and garlic bread....that has got to be the best bread in Phoenix! For dinner the BF got the New York with rice pilaf and I got the filet and scallops combo (fancy, huh?)...We both got the pumpkin bisque soup to start. The soup was SO good... creamy and delicious. Sweet and savory. It was like savory pumpkin pie....we both loved it. The steaks were delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The scallops were slightly on the fishy side, BUT they were also cooked perfectly and had this wonderful creamy herb sauce with them. It was like eating a deconstructed clam chowder almost. Very good. I had the mashed potatoes with my meats and they were creamy and flavorful. The filet melted in my mouth. Despite the fact that we were both stuffed beyond belief, the restaurant graciously offered us dessert on the house for our anniversary. We got the brownie pie on the recommendation of our waiter. It was so rich and wonderful. Two brownies with nuts sandwiching vanilla ice cream, topped with whipped cream and chocolate in a pool of chocolate sauce....ridic! The only problem with this place is it is very pricey....it isn't a place we could go to all the time for sure...but for a (very) special occasion, this place is top notch!

Chase field is a decent ballpark. I like going here to see baseball games (obviously), and most of the seats are good. The food selection is not great and is overpriced, as is pretty par for baseball fields everywhere, but if you are in Phoenix....you really don't have any other choice. I suggest eating at one of the many restaurant near the field or getting a hotdog from a vendor outside of the park before you go in to save money and to eat something a bit tastier. Also, you can bring sealed water bottles into the park, so I suggest doing that. It is cool that many Friday nights they have a fireworks display, so props for that. Go D Backs!

I have been here a few times and it is always excellent. I went today with my Dad for his birthday. We always get the guac. Get the guac!! it's so good... it's sweet with pomegranate seeds (i think), spicy with jalapeno, and just delicious.... it also has cilantro, avocado (duh), salt, onion.... it's great! So I usually get the pollo poblano which is delicious chicken with goat cheese and tomatillo sauce.... yum. But today we wanted to try something else so we tried the cochinita pibil at the waiter's recommendation. I am so glad we did! It is slow roasted pork that is roasted for 12 hours.... it just fall apart and yet is so juicy.... It was delicious. It came with spicy mashed potatoes and zucchini. It was all delicious. The pork came with little tortillas to wrap it in and then I put the guac on top.... whoa. Delicious. I will continue to go to this restaurant because although it is expensive... it is so worth it!

I went here this morning as part of my Coffee Tour de Phoenix!! (ftw). I went with the BF even though we were just next to this place last night (lots of driving this weekend). We got there around 10 and the place was busy, but we didn't have to wait long to order. The girl behind the counter was friendly and the clientele was kind of hippy dippy and 'trendy' but that's ok, that's what I kind of expect from a good coffee place. I ordered my usual, a latte, and the BF followed suit. We also shared a slice of pecan apple bread or something to that effect. The barista making the coffee was not so friendly, he kind of looked angry that people were at the shop (I can't really blame him, but still.... if you work in customer service you have to put on the show.... at least feign happiness a little). However, the coffee was good and he made a nice design in the top. The pastry was alright, but not the best I've ever had. I don't know where they get it from, but it was not particularly moist. It definitely was not bad though and we did eat it, so I'm just being nit picky. Overall the place was good, not the best coffee I have ever had, but definitely good for Phoenix. I would come back here if I were in the neighborhood.

I went back to Lux last night and was extremely impressed with their new place. It looks great, the food menu looks great (something I really need to try in the future), and the pastries looked even better than they did last time I was there. The guys behind the counter were funny, friendly, and made us feel comfortable while waiting for our coffee. The lattes were smooth, rich, and flavorful without the acidity that can really ruin a good latte. I can't wait to come here to try some pastries and a meal....

I have to update my review. After moving downtown, Lux has become my new favorite coffee shop, breakfast spot, dessert spot and dinner spot. This place is ridiculously good. Their coffee is on spot and consistent throughout the day. Their egg sandwich is inexpensive (5$), yet super high quality. They actually make their food in *gasp* pans! No microwaves here. The egg sandwich is an over medium egg on an english muffin with cheese, bacon, and a roasted tomato. So good. Now, as good as that is, the biscuits and gravy are even better. This is what the BF gets for breakfast and what I eat off his plate when he's not looking :-P. The gravy has chunks of delicious sausage (and I don't generally care for sausage). The gravy is very well seasoned and full of flavor. Then, this week, we went to Lux for dinner. We had the bacon/jalapeno mac and cheese and the yorkshire pudding burger. The mac and cheese was creamy, spicy, salty and delicious. The burger was a knife and fork burger that had very flavorful meat (almost meatloaf ish) and a really good horseradish -y sauce. Finally, their desserts....I crave their desserts, especially their peanut butter brownie. That brownie is so awesome because it has the saltyness of the peanut butter and a rich and sweet chocolate flavor of the brownie....it's like magic. Brownies are never my first choice for a dessert....except here. This place continues to impress me and I will continue to frequent Lux at all hours of the day...

This place was kind of disappointing. I was excited to try some spicy Mexican food, but it just wasn't that great. I went here with the BF tonight and the service was quite bad. We got there at about 7:45 pm and were seated. Then we waited, and waited, and waited, about 15 minutes before the waiter even took our order. Then we proceeded to wait about another 30 minutes for our food. Also, the salsa they gave us was spicy, but the flavors were weird and neither of us really liked it much. When our food finally got there, it was also a disappointment. I ordered the combo #1 which was a taco and a cheese enchilada. The enchilada was actually pretty good, with a decent flavored sauce, but the taco was not good. The meat was tough and flavorless. The combo had a chili pepper next to it, so I thought it would be spicy, but it was kind of bland. The BF got a bean and cheese burrito and said it was alright, but nothing special. Maybe people really like this place because of the margaritas, they did look good, and probably would have made the food taste better and the service seem quicker. However, we did not get any margaritas. Also, it was very expensive for what we got, around 23$ with no drinks..... way too much for the quality of food they are serving. We will not be back.

I went here this morning after mehkfast at Butters to fulfill my coffee needs and as part of the Coffee Tour of PHX!!! It was a bit busy, but we didn't have to wait long for our lattes. I like the atmosphere in the coffee house but found the lady singing outside was a bit annoying... and their pastries looked pretty good....but I didn't eat one (self control FTW!). The coffee reminded me of Cartel a bit, it was strong without being too strong. The latte was well made. I would come here again if I were in the neighborhood, but there are equally good or better coffee houses that are more convenient for me.

I hadn't been to Rainforest Cafe since I was a kid... I guess there was a reason for that. I went here with work since the students were studying the rainforest and how to behave in a restaurant. The service was sloooow, we were there for about 2 hours. The food came out far apart...making some of the kids upset. The food itself was nothing special. I had some mashed potatoes and clam chowder. Chowder was like the stuff you get out of the can... the mashed potatoes were ok, but gluey. The main issue with this place are their prices. They are insanely overpriced. You can't get an adult meal for less than 12$ and those meals are basic sandwiches... the entrees were about 20$... even for pasta.... craziness. Even their entree salads were 15$. I would not come back here.

I stayed at the Paris for the first time this weekend. I have always liked gambling at the paris because I like the atmosphere and I have gotten lucky here a few times. Staying here was also really nice. We had a strip view room that was awesome! The bed was comfy, the views were nice, we could see the pool and the Eiffel tower replica out one window and the strip including the Bellagio fountains out the other. The location is convenient, the deal we got on the room was good. The pool was fine, but it closed really early (7pm) so that was a bit weird. I would definitely stay here again if the price was right.

I have not stayed at this hotel, but have visited the casino many times. On my most recent visit, I had a strange experience here. As we walked towards the entrances from the strip, there was a strong feces smell, and upon entering the casino, the smell of cologne or Ax body spray hits you in the face. I don't know why they are pumping this scent in here, but it is gross... I could almost taste it.... ugh. On a good note, I did win here! On a bad note, they had no waitresses walking around to serve cocktails. Also, the casino is just too large and easy to get lost in.... it certainly isn't my favorite place, but I will most likely be back again in the future.

I landed in Vegas and about 30 minutes later I was having breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. I really liked this restaurant, and if it were based solely on my food, it would be 5 stars. I had the special eggs benedict for the day and it was ridiculously good. Crazy good. It was the english muffins (made in house) with brie cheese, spinach, onions (I think? hard to remember)....but it was just sooo good. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise was the best I have ever had. I wanted to lick the plate. Additionally, it came with herbed hash browns that were more like very thin french fries....all over amazingness. Fresh and delicious. Now, the BF got the nutella waffle and he thought it was just alright. The description made it seem like it would have hazelnuts in it, but it was just nutella in waffles (I thought it was super good, but he thought it was just ok). The portion was a bit small for the price. The coffee was very tasty and the service was great! Coffee was never empty. Anyway, I would definitely come back here the next time I am in Vegas for breakfast....

I have been to Mon Ami Gabi a total of 3 times including my last review. Two of the visits have been very good, one was not so amazing. The last time I went was last weekend and it was very good. A friend and I went for breakfast but once I got there I was really craving a burger...so I got a cheeseburger with brie and an over medium egg...that counts as breakfast, right? (Now I'm kind of kicking myself because reading my last review, they had the same special for benedict...ooooph). The coffee continues to be good, they use Intelligentsia, so it is consistent with other tasty coffee places. Let me say that the burger was super delicious and large (and i totally ate the whole thing....yum), BUT it was not cooked correctly...ordered medium, served well done. I didn't really mind, but to be technical, it was incorrect. The egg was cooked correctly. The whole thing was really very tasty. The frites that came with it were not so awesome... a little too thin, they were kind of the texture of pork rinds. Regardless, for 15$ I would certainly get it again.... I will be back.

I have stayed at the Flamingo twice in the past couple months. Both times have been fairly good, one a little better than the other. When I stayed in December, we upgraded to a view Deluxe room and it was pretty nice. The bathroom was redone with a glass shower...nice lighting...tv in the mirror...great view (slightly obstructed by their peeling 'skin' of Donny and Marie). I went and stayed again last weekend and we were in the area that hadn't been renovated so recently. The bathroom was kind of disgusting.... the tub was tiny and had an AC vent in it that was full of grime...yuck. The room itself was clean and had a hard floor (which I liked) and the beds were comfy. View was not so good, but it was a less expensive room. The prices weren't bad (40-50$ per night), but the resort fee of 18$ per night was a little ridiculous considering you don't really get anything for it...especially in the winter. I would stay here again, the location can't be beat and the rooms are fine for the price.

So the BF and I had gone here about 5-6 years ago and were not fans... but we finally tried it again tonight and have been converted! I love that they are open late....especially when i don't get home until 8:30.... We both got the classic burger and I got mine with caramelized onions. It's a good burger. It's meaty, the tomato is fresh, the pickles are tasty... pretty much everything you want in a burger. We also got a half order of mixed fries.... also delicious. The sweet potato fries were awesome because, unlike most sweet potato fries, the flavor of sweet potato was preserved in the fries. We finished with the red velvet cake which was very tasty... subtle, but a good cream cheesy flavor.   So why only 4 stars? I think for the money, the burgers should come with fries. Also, I wish they offered different sized burgers, cuz I could definitely do with about half of the meat I had. Still.... go here! It's good!

I can't believe I haven't updated this review for so long! So I have been to Delux several (and I mean SEVERAL) times since the last review. This place has my favorite burger in town. The Delux burger is crazy delicious. I was a fool to ever order the classic burger. The Delux burger has delicious caramelized onions on it and has bacon in it....yes....in it! I solved the problem of their huge burger sizes by taking half home and having it for lunch the next day (ohhh and it is soooo good the next day too). The sweet potato fries are the way to go here, like I said before, they preserved the flavor of the sweet potato in the fry, which is great because usually that delicious flavor is lost. Also, their fry sauce is excellent...good on the burger and good with the fries (and I'm not usually into mayo at all). The prices are a bit high, but for dinner and lunch the next day (and fries with dinner the next day because I always have to take half of the basket home), it is well worth it. Skip the desserts, though, not the most awesome and you can go get Hava Java next door (much better move for sure).

I went here for lunch today with a friend and it was very good! I had the grilled chicken banh mi and he had the grilled pork (but I was totally jealous cuz the pork was better!). The sandwiches are cheap (cash only) and huge! I couldn't finish mine. The veggies on it give the whole thing a wonderful bold flavor and the bread is warm and fresh. Everything there is well priced, I would like to go back and try some different things. So I will be doing that...

Echo canyon is one difficult climb. As you ascend the mountain, you find yourself thinking.... will the almost sheer vertical climbing ever end? Yes, yes it does.... and the view is the best one you can get in the valley. After the high of getting to the top and seeing the beautiful view, the realization that now you need to get back down this mountain sets in. Every step needs to be calculated as to not fall down the side of the mountain. As beautiful as the top of the mountain was, the bottom of the mountain was much sweeter.... I made it... alive! Would I go again? Absolutely! Go try this adventure for yourself.

Who doesn't love Gelato Spot? This location is nice, they have a large selection of flavors. The best part of this place is that it is attached to Hava Java which is also wonderful. When we went last week, the BF and I shared chocolate brownie and salted caramel and it was incredibly delicious. The salted caramel was not shy on the salt, it was salty and proud! I don't go out for ice cream or gelato very often, but when I do, this place tops the list.

This pizza is soo good! It reminds me of the pizza you would get on the Jersey shore. The slices are big and the sauce is very flavorful. Their prices are very reasonable too. And the best part? The tiramisu. You wouldn't think dessert would be that good coming from a pizza place, but man. This stuff is amazing and the perfect size and price.

I have gotten Mamma Mia several times since my last review (including some pizzas from the 8th st location that I believe is closed now). I have to say, it has not impressed me lately like it used to. It is much more like a generic pizza, nothing too special about it. Also, they changed the tiramisu!!! When I ordered it and got their new version, I was really disappointed. It was much larger, but not nearly as flavorful. Anyway, I will still get the occasional pizza here, but it is no longer my go to place.

I went here today for lunch with my dad, my brother, niece, nephew, and their cousin. There were some definite pros and cons to this restaurant.  Pros:  Good caesar salad CUTE kid's menu, little wax toys for them to play with, AND cute sectioned plates with a good serving of tasty food....really nice for kids The green chile burger was tasty...not 'crazy' good, but good.  They have a very nice patio which is great for beautiful days like today  Cons: Valet parking....really unnecessary Their soup of the day was not very good...a pork posole... it did not have a ton of flavor and was not hearty enough... The prices are a bit high   Overall, I liked it and would come back, but they could make some improvements.

mmmmmm I just went here this morning for breakfast and it was pretty yummy. I used to come here about 5 years ago before I left phoenix, and it is still as good as I remember it. The place is super small so getting there early is important if you don't want to wait. So we got there at around 7:15 and didn't have to wait, but we did have to sit at the back counter, not a table. That was alright, although weird people waiting kept staring at us like we couldn't see them through the window.... anyway, I got the griddle cakes. These are so good. I don't know what they put in them, but they are better than most any other pancakes. They taste like pancakes made by your grandma if your grandma was an awesome cook. I also got coffee and oj. The oj is delicious, small, but so good. Now here is why I took off a star. The coffee. The coffee is not good. Despite this, when I use to come here years ago they gave you real cream to put in the coffee. That improved the coffee dramatically. When I came today they gave milk... not even half and half. When the coffee is not good, I need something a little more potent than milk... plus I was looking forward to that cream. Oh well. The bf got a waffle that looked pretty good and came with really peppery bacon. All in all, it was a good trip but if the Matt's people are reading this.... Bring back the cream!!!   Kthanksbye.

I went to Sierra Bonita for brunch yesterday and must say it was pretty good. I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, checked out their menu online and decided to go. One disappointment....the prices they show on the website are not reflective of the real prices at all.... it showed 6$ for pancakes, but in the restaurant they are 10$...this is not an unreasonable price or anything, but I wish they would update their site so I wouldn't have been surprised. Anyway, the husband and I ate on the 'patio,' which is more like an Arizona room...it's indoors and has a fireplace, pretty cute set up. Our waiter was very helpful and friendly. The coffee was good and our waiter, seeing that the husband looked a little sickly (sunday morning...you do the math), he brought him a complimentary coffee drink...very nice! He got the pancakes, which were a nice balance of sweet and savory. They are blue corn pancakes with pine nuts and strawberry butter. I got the chile relleno, which was very tasty. The pepper was spicy and the filling consisted of cheese, chorizo, onion and potato...it had a creamy sauce and some pico on top along with over medium eggs....was tasty, but I wish the eggs were more runny (the yolks were almost hard). The flavor was good, though. Overall, I thought the food was good, the service was good, but it was a bit overpriced. I would go back for a special occasion.

This review is for the drinks/ambiance only. I went here last night to get a drink and ended up hanging out for 2 hours! This place is very comfortable and a good 'chill' bar. It is not super dark or even very 'trendy' but they have good drinks and are a nice place to relax. I had the coffee and Bailey's (how can you mess that up?). It was very good! I like that they use Lux coffee....nice attention to detail. Our waitress was excellent. She was not overbearing, but always seemed to be there when we needed something. They had a great Jazz musician there who played a lot of different instruments. I liked that the music wasn't overbearing, it was at a good volume and was nice background music. I would definitely visit this bar again and would like to try the food.

I've been to Tammie Coe a couple times as I live fairly close to this location. They have some pretty delish baked goods.... I've tried the crack cake (chocolate and mocha deliciousness), red velvet cupcake (cream cheesy frosting of wonderfullness... but hard to eat due to the top being larger than the base and all of the sprinkles), Ooey gooey cupcake (ummm yum!), and the brownie (just ok...way too much frosting). Overall, I don't think this is the most delicious dessert in town, but it is very good and I would (obviously) go back.

Pita Jungle is delish and this location is no exception. I came here with a large party (10+) and they accommodated us well and gave us great service. I had the chicken tikka masala, which was unlike the typical version of this dish, but absolutely delicious topped with pea shoots. The portion was giant, I took a big container of it home. I also got to try one of the flatbreads, which was spicy and fresh tasting, a variety of tasty hummuses (hummi?), and the dolmades. Everything was good. Definitely recommend it!

We came here last night after dinner and it was a pretty fun little bar. The drinks were inexpensive (5$ for a Guinness and 5$ for an amaretto sour and it was strong!). They have a juke box, which is fun, and comfy chairs. This place had a nice vibe, it's like you are sitting in someone's basement. I would come back here again.

I have so many awesome memories of this theatre. I've been coming here for years and years to see all of the limited release movies and indie movies. Yes, this movie theatre is old, and if your movie is in theatres 3-5, you will be in a tiny theatre that has an older feel, but that's part of the charm! Theatres 1 and 2 are nice, large, and new. The chairs are comfortable. The BF and I went to Camelview this weekend to see Blue Jasmine (which was awesome!) and as we walked in, the delicious smell of popcorn was overwhelming (we managed to resist, but it was so sad to do so). Harkins has THE best popcorn around (soooo much better than AMC...ick), which also adds to the excellence of this theatre. I'll continue coming to Camelview to see indie movies because I like it and because they are usually the only place showing these movies. Gotta love it!

The husband and I went here last weekend to celebrate the beginning of my break and to get a juicy burger. The restaurant is cute, kind of themed, and the service was friendly. They smoke their meat for 18 hours and you can see their chicken roasting from the dining room. They start you with some pretty good cornbread. For entrees we split the burger with bacon and bbq sauce and the pulled pork sandwich with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese... very healthy. The burger was tasty, not the most amazing burger ever, but solidly good. The pulled pork was better, definitely flavorful and good with their spicy bbq sauce. Both sides were pretty mediocre, I didn't like the mac and cheese...tasted like velveeta and the mashed potatoes were gluey. When we were done they brought out a little bag with a couple doughnut bites in it.... yum! I would come back here to try some more of their Q.

Wow. Just wow. Why haven't I gone to this place before now? Am I crazy? So I went there last night for my birthday with the BF and it was wonderful! We got there at around 9 due to my having class until late at night, but they were just as pleasant to us as if we got there at a normal dining time, and we got a parking spot, which was great.   First of all, bottles of wine with no corkage fee from their grocery. What?!?! What! yes. It's true. We had a bottle of wine at a restaurant for 15$. That's like a glass and a half of wine at Postino. This was too awesome. That alone is enough to make me want to go back.   So on to food, we ordered their special salad for the night which was a caprese. This stuff was good. It had house made mozz on the bottom, then ricotta, then a whole roasted tomato, then the perfect amount of sea salt (?), some kind of salt and pepper, delicious balsamic, and strips of basil. This was so good. I was so happy we decided to get it, I only wish we kept the plate so I could have dipped my pizza crust in the balsamic.... yum. Then we got the roasted corn pizza. This was also very good. The corn on the pizza tasted really sweet and delicious and it was the perfect counter to the goat cheese. The crust was also very good and the whole thing tasted fresh. We finished with the red velvet cake. At first, I wasn't a fan, but as I ate it, it got increasingly good. It is more subtle than a lot of cake out there, but that is a good thing!   Also, our waitress was super sweet and helpful. She helped us pick out all of our food, and she was spot on. I will definitely be back here soon.

I have been back a few times since my last review, and I must say, LGO is still good, but not as good as the first time. The pizza is still good, I like the thin crust and the inventive toppings. They just haven't been quite as good as they used to be. The caprese salad isn't that special one that I had the first time either....sigh. You know what still is delicious? That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good. I don't love the forced valet parking....why can't we just park? aaanyway, I would not say that LGO is the best pizza in Phoenix, but it is still a solid choice.

I went here for brunch today with my mom. This place is super cute, it has a really nice looking patio and the inside is small, but clean and comfortable. I got the veggie scramble sandwich with orange juice and she got a blt. It was so inexpensive! My mom had a coupon for bogo entrees with the purchase of two drinks which brought our total to 8$. Seriously?!?! Without the coup it would be like 12$....pretty amazing. The food was good. It was not the most amazing food ever, but it was fresh and cooked by a person in a pan (not in a microwave) and beats the pants off of an Einstein bagel sandwich or anywhere else with comparable prices. The veggie scramble had a variety of tasty vegetables like eggplant and mushrooms in addition to cheese and tomato. My mom enjoyed her sandwich (and the couscous that came with it). I saw some other people get salads...they were huge! I would definitely come here again for breakfast and would like to try lunch here.

Sorry Steve! I feel kind of guilty, but I have come here two or three times in the last couple of weeks due to it's somewhat close proximity to my living area..... each time has been worse and worse. I still haven't tried the food, which still looks super good! I did, however, try some different coffee drinks. I tried the mocha coconut iced and the aztec mocha iced. Both were appalling. I could not finish either. The coconut tasted WAY too sweet and a little chemical -ish. The Aztec was okay at first.... but slowly became cloyingly sweet as well.... maybe it's the chocolate they use? It was totally unpleasant. The Barista's have always been nice enough, and the space is nice, but man. The coffee just isn't there.....

The BF and I ate here because our friends who were with us wanted to. It was extremely over priced and the food was not great. I got a veggie omelet and it was bland and the veggies seemed like they were frozen (?). The coffee was not good either. I wish we could have gone some place good instead of just eating at the most convenient place, but hey, that's what I get for going to vegas with a big group of people.

Uuuugh. The BF went and picked up food from PF changs tonight because we had a gift card and I still can't go out due to coldy fluish yuck disease.... wtf, I can't shake it. So I got wonton soup (for the throat), the BF got sweet and sour chicken and we shared some dumplings. The soup was so bland.... possibly the most bland wonton soup I have ever tried. The BF thought the sweet and sour chicken was alright.... but the menu says it is pan fried and the chicken is clearly deep fried... yuck. Also, They really don't give you a very large portion for what you pay.... most places I can eat the food for at least two days on what they give you, but the BF finished all maybe 10 pieces of chicken that were on his dish.  I would never pay to eat at this restaurant. Their food is so ridiculously bad for you and expensive. Their double pan fried noodles have just about a full day's worth of sodium and calories... ugh. I do not understand how the PF Changs all stay in business.... they're just not good. I had better chinese food yesterday and the entrees cost 5$....

I have sadly been to this On the Border more than once due to family members liking it. I just don't get it. The food here is substandard 'Mexican' that tastes extremely salty and is loaded with sodium, calories, and fat (their fish tacos have over 1800 calories... whoa). Their portions are outrageously large. Don't bother looking at their nutritional facts, it will make you sad.... And yes, I get it , Americanized Mexican food is generally bad for you, but at least it tastes good at other restaurants. To their credit, they do have a 'healthy' menu that lists the calories, unfortunately this food is also not very good. On my most recent visit, I got the 'healthy' combo with an enchilada and fajita taco with a side of grilled veg. The veg was fine, the taco tasted like they dumped a bunch of that lime juice that comes in the green bottle all over some prepackaged precooked chicken slices... not awesome, but made better by adding some of the grilled veg and some salsa to it. The enchilada was also nothing special, but not terrible. The husband's enchiladas were a 'salt lick.' A family member ordered the guac, which they made table side. I don't even know how they could make fresh guac so flavorless. I would not recommend on the border to anyone and am keeping my fingers crossed that I will not have to make a return visit.

So I went here for customer appreciation day to try this BBQ for free!! This place was so busy, obviously due to free food. The line went really fast though, my friend and I waited only about 15 minutes and then got some bbq pork sandwiches with beans and coleslaw. So the sandwich was good, it probably could have had more sauce, but it was tasty. The beans were also very tasty. I'm not a coleslaw fan, and this was just par. I would definitely come here again and try something else, as the flavors were good. Also, it was very nice of them to do a free day, that's great. My friend said he thought the food was good, but the coleslaw was too wet. I don't know about that.

Of all the Fox restaurants in town, I think this one is in my top 3. I've been wanting to try Olive and Ivy for a long time, so when I got notification that they were offering 25% off on Memorial day, I pretty much had to go. I (luckily) made a reservation (otherwise there was a 45 min wait at lunch time). We were seated right away. We had fantastic service throughout with a knowledgeable and friendly waitress. We had the delicious pesto and bread ( 2 servings because I'm a pig) and we split the bacon cheeseburger and the lasagna. The cheeseburger was tasty, with a definite charred taste to it. The onions were really good (and the pesto that came with the bread was good on it too). The lasagna was also tasty, with a distinctly red wine based Bolognese sauce. The portion was large allowing us to take half home. Also, it came with some of the most fantastic garlic bread.... just oozing with butter and garlic... I'd come here just for that. I'll be back!

I went to Corbin's today after hiking at North Mountain. We arrived at about noon and were seated right away. We shared the Asian chicken salad and the asparagus quesadilla. The salad was supposed to have a spicy peanut dressing, but it wasn't spicy at all....but it was fresh and overall an alright salad, but nothing to write home about. The quesadilla was very good however. It was actually a cheese crisp, but it was flavorful and the asparagus and artichoke had a smoky flavor and were very tender....delicious. Would definitely go back for this again.

The BF decided to take me on a date tonight (Woot!), and we chose to try this place. I'm really glad we did! The place is cute, despite being in a strip mall with a dollar theatre. We had to wait, but only a few minutes and got a table on the patio. Unfortunately, it was right by the door so we had a lot of people hovering around us while waiting for tables, but it was ok.   They brought out some really good garlic bread, focaccia, and slices of a baguette in a basket which was really nice. I got a glass of their house pinot grigio (without remembering that I could have gotten it free with a coupon... i felt stupid) and the BF got a Peroni off the tap. The alcohol was priced well with the wine at 6$ and the beer at 5$. We ordered the bruschetta, and it was good.. not the best we've ever had, but good. It didn't have any balsamic on it, so that would make it a lot better. For mains I ordered the gnocchi and the BF got a chicken caesar salad without dressing (I hate when he makes me feel unhealthy...). Mine came with a salad and it was good, it had creamy italian dressing which I love! More places should have creamy italian....yum. The gnocchi were delicious, really light and had a really good tomato basil sauce. The BF enjoyed his salad, but a salad without dressing is kind of hard to mess up. We got the tiramisu for dessert and it was really tasty. It came with chocolate sauce all around and strawberries on top. Again, it wasn't the best tiramisu I've had but it was good.   The service overall was nice, the waiter was timely and did not bother us much. He didn't come by to ask how our food was, but that was fine with me because it all was fine. The food came out kind of slowly, but it was nice to have a leisurely meal.   So overall, I'm a fan, but it's not the best. I'd go back, though, because it is close to home, reasonably priced, and tasty. The whole meal only cost 50$ before tip, and we were both very full at the end, so thumbs up to that!

I went here this past saturday morning and it *almost* lived up to expectations. The BF and I ordered double lattes, which were very tasty, but tiny considering they cost 4$. He got a french almond croissant, which was not as light, flaky, and delicious as I expected from reviews... but it was good. I got a caramel macaron which was delicious... the caramel filling melted in my mouth and was super tasty. The real problem was that I ordered an egg sandwich and we waited a good 30 minutes for it... for real? it is a fried egg on toast with a slice of cheese..... That was pretty crappy, however, the sandwich itself was delicious! Not quite worth the wait.... but enough to make me not incredimad about waiting so long. I would come back, but I would definitely consider the ridiculous wait time before I ordered another hot meal.

I went here tonight with the BF to use a Voice deal and I'm really glad we did because the food was mighty tasty. We were the only people in the restaurant, which made me nervous, but it also made for very good service, with our bread and water never being left empty. The bread was fresh and warm and fairly tasty. I had the cheese ravioli and it was very good. The marinara had a lot of flavor and the portion size was perfect. The BF got the gnocchi in the creamy pink sauce (rosa I think?) and his was also tasty, with a rich buttery flavor. My only complaint was I really REALLY wanted to try their tiramisu (pretty much the whole reason I bought the deal...) and they didn't have any.... truly sad for me. Luckily, we will most likely come back here again and be able to try the tiramisu then (hopefully...).

I have gone here many times over the years due to its close proximity to my mom's house. It has always been mediocre... but alright. Today it was not so good. I called in to order a to go order at lunch time for my mom (who's sick) and myself. We had some specific instructions (hold the beans etc). So I get there and there were some seriously weird (possibly drunk) people in line in front of me. It took them about ten years (or minutes) to complete their order. So it's finally my turn, and I tell the lady that I have an order for Jennifer. She says... you do? what was on that order. So I tell her the basic components of the order (not including the details because I thought she was trying to locate the order). She then walked away and did not come back for fifteen minutes. She was tending the bar. When she came back I asked her what happened and she said that the person who was working up front took the order and couldn't leave so the order was never placed and therefore she had to re -place the order. Well.... that sucked because I did not know she was placing the order again and did not include that I didn't want beans and sour cream... kind of a big part of the order. So I get home and the burrito is just covered in beans and sour cream..... gross. I just wish there was some communication... why didn't she just tell me that they didn't place the order. I didn't even get a chance to ask her questions because she went over to bar tend. Well, my mom called and they credited her the money for the messed up order, which is the right thing to do and they get props for that.... but the quality is yet to be seen.

Yummmmm! I had a deal chicken deal for this place, os the BF and I gave it a try this afternoon for linner (lunch/dinner). The place is cute inside... has that modern feel. I ordered the carne asada on a potato pancake and he got the hot chick sandwich with sweet potato fries. We also split a side salad. The salad was good, it tasted very fresh and the balsamic dressing was creamy and delicious. The carne asada was sooo good! Wow! The meat was very tender, I was able to cut it with a butter knife, and it had a great flavor of the combo of guac, spicy tomato sauce, pico de gallo, and cotija cheese. Then you add in a potato pancake and it is just a flavor explosion in your mouth. It was sweet, savory, spicy, creamy, and crunchy all at the same time. It was pretty awesome. The hot chick sandwich was also very delicious. It was smokey because it has a smokey cheese, but it also tasted really fresh from the veggies and the chicken was juicy. Overall it was a very good meal. I'll be back, especially to try the awesome 5$ burgers on monday and good looking happy hour.   PS I have been by there at night on weekends to try to get a drink and it is super crowded... it's probably fun, but not my scene.

I have been in to the Wag N Wash a couple times, once to buy cat food and once to get my puppy groomed. The people who work here are helpful and seem to be knowledgeable about their products. There is a long wait to get your pup groomed, we had to schedule 3 weeks out, so keep that in mind. They did a good job on my puppy and were very reasonably priced. I will definitely be frequenting the Wag N Wash for grooming and pet care needs.

Well... Qcumberz is my favorite antique store. This place is packed full of stuff and dangerous.....in that I always spend money when I go there. How could you not? They have some great stuff. I found a punch bowl with cups for like 15$, I found a step stool for 9$.... I found an 8 track player (yes...they have those and the 8 tracks to play in them), I found my bench for my front porch here (restored city of Phoenix bench...cool stuff).... They just have so many fun items, some restored items painted fun colors and some true antique items... the prices are right, the selection is great, I would highly recommend this place for some fun treasure hunting.

I went here today with my dad and my brother for lunch. I was unsure of going here when my dad first suggested it, but I'm glad we tried it! The place is a little like paradise bakery in set up (you order at the counter, seat yourself), but the food is much better and tastes less processed. My Dad and I split the chicken parm sandwich and the wildflower salad. I was glad to find out that the chicken parm has grilled chicken on it (not fried) and only one slice of bread, bringing down the calorie count significantly. Also, the sandwich had TONS of flavor as it had veggies in addition to the typical sauce, chicken, and cheese.... I would definitely order it again. The salad was tasty, but my brother's asian chicken salad was better. I like that they have all of the nutritional info available on their website...it makes it easier to determine what might be fairly healthy. Surprisingly, most of their sandwiches are around 900 calories! Made me think twice before ordering. Despite this, I will go back because the food is very flavorful. At least I know what I am eating, and I like that.

I really don't like AMC very much. I prefer Harkins and even Cinemark to AMC. So I went and saw a movie here yesterday with my mom and sister in law and it was fine, the movie was good. That really has nothing to do with the theatre, but it helps. I guess my main complaint with AMC is their concessions. They are really expensive and not very good. The popcorn is expensive and it's not good. They have the do it yourself butter which is terrible because then you can't get any butter in the middle of the popcorn and about 10 minutes into the movie the popcorn is all dry and sticks in your throat. Although, this may be a good thing because their butter tastes weird... like a little fishy. yuck. Anyway, I just think there are better theatres out there (like any other type of theatre....). I understand this may just be convenient or you may have a gift card to AMC (like we did), but it's just meh.

We were staying in the excalibur (NOT my choice... ugh) and decided to eat breakfast at the buffet out of convenience. Ugh. We waited for 40 minutes to get in and once we got in I waited another 35 minutes for an omelet. there were only like 4 people in front of me... I don't know how it possibly took so long, but the BF was able to eat a complete plate of food while I was waiting. The food wasn't inedible, but it was definitely the worst buffet food I've had in vegas. We decided to wait for them to turn the buffet over to lunch, but once they did there was nothing that looked good enough to eat. It was like they opened frozen dinners and put them into chaffing dishes. Don't waste your money here.

I went here last weekend with the BF's parents to see if we would like to have our rehearsal dinner here. When we first walked in, I wasn't 100% convinced because this place is old school....like what I remember a sizzler or something looking like in the 90's. The place is dark and it has an old school salad bar.... need I say more? But this place really surprised me with their excellent service and food. We started with apps (which is totally unnecessary because the portions here are out of control). We had the spinach dip and the potato skins....it was good, but typical bar food. I also had a couple mimosas because they were on special for 1$....heck yes! We then got our soup/salad bar. I had the soup and it was good, nothing terribly special, but not bad. Then the (humongous) entrees....I had the lamb chops and they were delicious! They were perfectly cooked and seasoned....super juicy, they reminded me of eating lamb chops at home as a kid....definitely delicious. The BF had the new york strip which was equally good. He got it medium well, and they managed to keep it moist and juicy....awesome! We all got twice baked potatoes with our meals, which were very good (how can potato and cheese and bacon and whatnot be bad?). We finished with mud pie, which was ok, but nothing special. Anyway, at the end of the meal (while I was sitting there dying of stuffedosity) the owner came over and spent the time to chat with us about how our party was going to be set up and what the room would look like. I liked how friendly and accommodating the owner was. We are planning to have our rehearsal dinner, so I will update after that! Definitely check this hidden treasure out!

I went here tonight with the BF. We thought it was really meh, capital MEH. We had a reservation, but for some reason got sat inside. There were virtually no people eating inside and outside was lively and had a band playing... we couldn't even hear it inside... it was like silent. I would think they would at least open the doors, but nope. So that was a bad start. It took our waitress a long time to even come to our table, and when she came she asked if we wanted drinks and apps (which we didn't given the portion size) and we ordered dinner. The waitress seemed kind of short with us, and it may have been that she was busy or that she was mad we didn't order more items. Anyway, so I ordered the chicken and the bf ordered the pulled pork. Both were pretty lack luster. First off, the food came out really fast... like it was all premade fast... and it wasn't really hot, just kind of warm. Like other people have said, the chicken sounds really good but actually comes out kind of bland. The menu says the chicken is pounded but my chicken was like 2 inches thick, so that was weird. The breading wasn't really crispy and the whole thing just wasn't that good. The bf's pork was also kind of bland, even with the dipping sauce that came with it. The sides were alright (mashed potatoes, corn bread, carrots-these didn't have a ton of flavor). Despite the food being underwhelming, we did decide to order dessert. This is why I gave this restaurant 2 stars. The banana burrito was delicious! I wish I had just eaten this for dinner.  So we get our check and I have a 30$ groupon. The bill comes back and only 20$ was taken off. We waited for about 6 minutes for the waitress to come back and she was good about it, she fixed it. It just seemed like a weird mistake. Anyway, for the two of us to get mains and split a dessert (no apps and no drinks) cost me a total of 45$ (would have been 60). This was way too much for what we got. I felt kind of ripped off. Maybe it was just my experience, but it was overall underwhelming.

I was hesitant to eat here, as the menu just didn't sound that appealing, but the husband was adamant about coming here, so we did. I am glad we ended up here! The service was outstanding! Very attentive, friendly, and filled with great recommendations. I had their pineapple mojito at the recommendation of our server and it was the perfect amount of herb and sweet.... very good. It was 12$, but hey, this is Vegas.... that was kind of a steal. For lunch, I had their soup of the day... a Thai coconut chicken soup.... it was sooo good. The best part was the tender mushrooms, and I don't even like mushrooms! The husband had a club sandwich, and he enjoyed it thoroughly. It came with a nice salad that was lightly dressed. Lunch was a bit pricey at about 50$, but considering I got a drink, this wasn't too bad. I would come back!

So.... this place is ridiculously overpriced. I went last night with the Bf and a couple friends. We wanted to get a couple beers and have some food. First of all, they do not list any prices for beers.... I think they should probably do that considering how ridiculously expensive their beer is. We asked the server for prices and she said 'They start around 4$ and then go up from there depending on the beer with an average of around 6$' Well... that's not really so helpful. I ordered the rose gaarden which is hoegaarden mixed with framboise lambic... it was good, until I found out it was almost 9$..... for a beer? What? That is the most expensive beer I have ever had. Our food was alright, but also ridiculously priced. I got the summer salad (strawberries, avocado, romaine, mandarin oranges from a can and balsamic). It was fine, but pretty small for a 9$ appetizer salad. Oh and if you want chicken on it, it's an extra 5$ or so.... that must be some amazing chicken. You can't get an entree salad or sandwich for less than 10$. I did get a cup clam chowder too, and it was not great and kind of luke warm when I got it... meh. Everyone else got sandwiches and said they were fine, but nothing special. I feel like just because the place has a lot of beers on tap does not mean they should charge double what anywhere else sells the same beers for. So anyway, for a sandwich, a salad, and 5 beers, our bill came out to about 65$. That will never ever happen again. I could go to a nice local non-chain restaurant in the valley and get better food for that kind of money, which is what I suggest everyone does.

I had my wedding at this venue. I was so excited to have my wedding at this amazing art space. We worked with Riette, who was great, she checked in on us once a month to make sure all was going well and to help us with any planning issues. She made time to meet with us and our vendors, she was overall very good. So why only 4 stars? Well, for one, they have 6 choices for caterers (which is fine) and their reasoning is to ensure that all of the caterers know the venue and how to use the space effectively...well, our caterer did not seem familiar with the space at all and was doing all sorts of odd things (cooking outside by cell phone light....*cough*) so I think maybe they should rethink who they suggest. Also, I know you can't control the artwork that will be shown at the wedding, which was fine with us because they usually have such amazing modern or funky art....but for our wedding, they had (and no offense intended) some really poor photography that looked like it was shot by a high schooler that depicted all graves. Yes....all graves....and not even pretty graves, like plain crosses in the desert....it was not artistic or funky as their displayed work generally is, it was not good for photos, and it just generally disappointed and depressed us (there was cool artwork in the cocktail space, though, including a painting of a giant middle finger behind the bar, which we thought was kind of funny). Despite these small details, I would definitely recommend this venue if you are thinking about it for your event.

My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary, and it was very good. The ambience was a little old school, but the food was great. We split a light salad to start and the waiter had them split it onto two plates for us, which was really nice. The salad was flavorful, but not overpowering. I had scotch beef for my main and he had BBQ pork. They were both delicious! I could have licked the bowls. Finally for dessert we had this amazing cheesecake with rosemary caramel sauce. It was so rich and wonderful. This place is a bit pricey, but it is so worth it.

Peoria Sports Complex is a fun place to go see games and they are home to the Mariner's, my (second) home team! It's a nice park, not too big, but not too small. There are a lot of places to get food, but none of them look particularly tasty. I was also slightly miffed that they started charging 5$ for parking....pretty lame. Other than that, this place is good, I went a couple weeks ago to see Mariner's/Cubs, and it was a fun game to watch. I will definitely come back here, and encourage others to come support the M's!

I head to the public market every Saturday to get my veggies and sometimes on other days to eat at the food trucks. The market on Saturday is impressive. You can get delicious bread, locally grown veggies, fruit, plants, and many other locally made wares. Most stalls take credit card and if they don't, you can buy with a card at customer service. The Wed market is less impressive... not much there, but definitely good if you forgot something or need a couple items mid week. This isn't the most amazing farmer's market in the world, but it is my favorite in Phoenix.

I've hiked North Mountain several times including the national trail, Shaw Butte trail, and the loop nature walk. I think I liked the national trail the best because the payoff is great. The views are amazing. This mountain is semi difficult, but I really enjoy hiking here. The trails are busy but not TOO busy. I have never had difficulty finding parking. I will definitely hike here again!

I went to Urban Cookies for the first time a couple days ago. I had had one of their cupcakes at Serranos and it was amazing. The one that I got from the bakery was also good, but not as good as the one I had had before. When I walked into the tiny bakery it smelled delicious like fresh baking cake....thinking about it now makes me want some. I got the peanut butter chocolate cupcake. Everything about it was good, but I wish it had a little less frosting and that the chocolate they used was dark chocolate. The cake had a good consistency and it was tasty, so I would definitely return.

Since my previous review, I have been back to Urban Cookies for cupcakes a few more times. I will have to say they do have winners and less awesome flavors, but they are very tasty over all. On my most recent visit they had superbowl cupcakes. I brought home a Seahawks (mocha....duh), a broncos (chocolate marshmallow), and the 49ers (red wine buttercream, vanilla cake, and chocolate filling). The Seahawks was good, the coffee flavor came through and the chocolate was perfect with it...a real classic. The broncos was kind of a loser in my opinion (ha.... in more ways than one...ha). It tasted like a ho ho or something...more like a prepackaged cake than a fresh one. Was not my fave at all. The real winner, however, was the 49ers cupcake...it sounds weird, but it was so so SO good. The chocolate and the red wine went perfectly together. As the husband and I finished this cupcake I was sad.... I may never get to have this cupcake again...oh no! Please put this on as a regular special...it is awesome!!!   Anyway, as a whole, Urban Cookie is a cute small local bakery with tasty cupcakes for a reasonable price (on par with other cupcake places). Check them out!

This is my neighborhood park and I don't think it can get much better than this. I go here almost everyday to walk my dog and the park is always fairly quiet, clean, and well maintained. The park is huuuuge... it has a bunch of paths, fishing, paddle boats, playgrounds, golf course, tennis courts, basketball courts... there are always families here and it just has a nice feel. I'm so happy to have a park like this by my house... will continue to visit regularly.

This place is a fast food restaurant.... I just don't understand why their prices don't reflect this. The BF and I went in here last night to get the summer sampler, and we were excited to try this new place for less money. Well what we paid was STILL too much for what we got. We ordered the caprese salad, a pizza with pepperoni and arugula, and two glasses of chardonnay. The caprese salad was not what was expected. Usually it's just basil, tomato, mozz, balsamic, and evoo. This was a salad (like lettuce) with hidden chunks of mozz and tomato in it, as well as some soggy pieces of bread. The mozz was the most flavorless mozz cheese I have had in a long time.... not so good. Otherwise, the salad was a plain old salad, but not what I wanted when I ordered it.... oh well. The pizza came out ridiculously fast. This leads me to believe that they are all sitting back there made and waiting to be shoved in the oven real quick and brought out. Our pizza had some spots that were covered in black burnt crust and some that seemed like they'd barely been in an oven (droopy, chewy, meh tasting). The pizza also lacked a lot of flavor, the sauce was almost non existent in taste, and it could have been a frozen pizza for how it tasted. The wine we got was also not pleasant.... although, chardonnay is not my usual wine, I have had it and this was particularly bad. The people who work there were very friendly, however, so that is a plus. I suppose if you want expensive fast food pizza....come here. For 'italian' style pizza, there are just too many other (good) restaurants in the valley to waste your time here.

This little place is really creepy looking, but really good. I come here often with my dad, as it is close to his work. I always get, i believe, the number 8 -chili relleno, taco, and enchilada with rice. It is always really good.... Also their chips, salsa, and guac are great. The place is never too busy *see the store front for why* but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Also, it is relatively inexpensive, especially for the size of the entrees. I would definitely go to this place all the time if I lived a little closer.

This was.....not good at all. I ate here because the BF and I got to comicon 2 hours early this morning and needed to kill time and we were hungry. We were debating between going here and going to cartel..... Well we definitely should have gone to Cartel. We walked in and immediately we had to wait to put our name down for about 10 minutes despite the guy in charge of that clearly seeing us. Then, once we were seated, we waited about another ten minutes for anyone to even come by our table to ask what we wanted to drink. The coffee was metallic and not very enjoyable. I ordered the veggie omelet using egg whites and the BF got the chocolate chip pancakes.... The veg was not good.  They chose some of the weirdest veggies for an omelet.... celery? Who puts celery in an omelet? That's all I could taste and it was not good. The cheese also was tasteless. The potatoes that came with it were standard, not real flavorful, but not awful. The really shocking part was that somehow they made the english muffin that came with the plate completely bland. It really had no taste at all. It was like eating chewy jelly.... not good. Why don't they just go buy a pack of Thomas muffins if this is the best they can do, because those are much better. The pancakes were dry and bland, despite the chocolate chips. It was hard to swallow it because it was so dry. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

I have been thinking about trying this restaurant for awhile, and when the BF and I couldn't decide on breakfast this morning, I decided it was time to try it. We got there around 10 and it wasn't very busy, we didn't have to wait long and easily got a table. So I wrestled with what to give this place star wise. The lady who owns the restaurant was really nice, she even came by our table and said hello. Additionally, the employees were nice. The food was just meh, not terrible by any means, but not good or memorable in any way....so I had to go with the 2 (sorry guys). I had the eggs florentine and, though the eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was not made correctly. It was very acidic and tasted not good, which kind of put a damper on the whole thing (as it covered all of the food). The bread was good, but it got soggy quickly (which is why I think they traditionally use english muffins). The potatoes were mealy and not crispy at all. I barely ate any of them because they were that meh. The BF got the strawberry pancakes. The pancakes were flavorless....like puffy white bread, but with less flavor. I figure a place is fairly meh when their pancakes are worse than those at Ihop. I even said to the BF that if this place were the only breakfast place in town....I would probably just cook at home. Now, it could have been an off day, and I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I probably would drive out of my way to go here again.

So I went here for the first time last night for the BF's birthday with some friends. It was a lot of fun! I loved all of the activities, we played horseshoes and other people were playing volleyball, pingpong, and some bean bag game. The alcohol was fine, nothing to get too excited about, but I don't think this is the kind of bar to go for specialty drinks or anything.... it's about hanging out with friends and playing games (for free :-)). I did have one of their frozen daiquiri's, and man, it had quite a bit of alcohol in it. There were some interesting characters here last night...They had some cover band of Jimmy Buffett or something, so there were a lot of older people (dressed in too skimpy clothes, but that's their prerogative). We grilled our own cheeseburgers and that was fun. They provide a bunch of different seasonings for the burgers and then also a bunch of toppings. They also offer to grill it for you if you don't feel like grilling it yourself. Overall, it was a really fun place and I would like to go back.   Also, as far as having kids leave after 8, I was surprised there were kids there to begin with.... it is a bar after all. I think all bars have some time limit where kids can't be around anymore, and I think that's for the best.... who wants kids at a bar? And also, it could be an unsafe environment for a child anyway.

I went here to get my eyebrows waxed today and was pretty happy with them. I walked in on a whim without an appointment and they took me right away. This was really no spa experience, but it was clean and the girl that did my eyebrows was thorough. The only thing that was a little off putting was that the girl asked if I wanted her to wax other parts of my face...but there is no reason for me to do that as I do not have coarse or dark hair anywhere else on my face....makes me think they are really just trying to make extra money for unnecessary services. Also, when I went to pay with my card, they asked if I had cash and  were pretty insistent on getting cash....a little shady, and then when she gave me change she didn't give me any ones to try to get a larger tip. Overall, I felt like this place was a little shady, but it was inexpensive and they did a good job, so I suppose I can look past these things.

I remember when this theatre opened about 5 years ago and I was so excited to go to a brand new kind of movie theatre (not AMC, Harkins). The theatre was the only thing out there and I wondered if anything else would be built around it. Well now Mesa Riverview has tons of shops and restaurants and all kinds of things to help entice people to go to the movies at cinemark. I really like the Cinemark. I went there on friday night to see Rango (which was a weird movie...) and it was a good experience. We went to the 10:30 showing and expected to be free of children.... no such luck. Some ladies brought about 6 kids to this movie ranging from approximate age range of 2-6. Really? you brought a 2 year old out to a movie in the middle of the night? So of course the kid was bored and started running around the theatre and crying. Awesome. Bad parenting... yes, but not the movie theatre's fault. In addition,  I don't like that they have do it yourself butter.... I mean come on movie theatres... why would anyone want to do the butter themselves? You can't get any in the middle! Despite that, the popcorn was good, way better than AMC but not as good as Harkins. The theatres are big and have comfortable seats. And as other yelpers have said, there aren't huge crowds here and there's a lot more parking available than at Tempe Marketplace. So switch it up and try Cinemark!

I went here tonight for dinner with a couple of friends and I must say... it was pretty meh. I don't really understand how this chain got as big as it is because it is overpriced and not very good. Plus the 'kitsch' is kind of annoying, right down to all of fake enthusiasm and the names of menu items. I got the potato soup and salad combo (which costs 9$) and the salad was pretty terrible. It looked like they opened a bag of rabbit salad and dumped it on a plate with some cheese on it. The lettuce tasted like it had not been washed. The soup was mediocre, not bad, but not as good as potato soups I have had at other chain restaurants. Oh...and there was a bug on our table. You heard me. A bug. I don't know what it was....but it was a medium sized bug and was kind of gross and unappetizing. I'm not trying to say the place is dirty, because I'm sure every restaurant has had a bug come in...hard to avoid....but I think the place should be maintained enough to keep them off of the tables at least. Anyway, I feel that my money and calories are best spent elsewhere, sorry RR.

This place was definitely meh. I was super disappointed because the house is so cute, it still has little rooms like a real house.... very nice.... but the food was just the most bland food I have ever had at a breakfast place, and that includes denny's and the like. That's pretty pathetic. I got the buffalo scramble, which has ground buffalo, onion, bell pepper, tomato, mushroom and jack cheese and comes with toast and hashbrowns. I asked for it with no mushrooms.... no such luck, I got mushrooms. That wasn't a huge deal though. The real problem was the overwhelming lack of any flavor. You would think with that list of ingredients that it would have tons of flavor, but it just tasted like mushy, creamy, nothing. There was way too much cheese and the cheese was bland and nasty.... the buffalo being ground is also not a good idea because it has a weird mouth feel and looks like little turds.... also, buffalo is a beautiful meat, why grind it up? I think the lack of flavor may be because they do not saute the veggies before adding the egg (or at least that's my guess.... not sure) Anyway, I thought maybe the hash browns would be better.... no. Tasted like nothing! WTF? Has this place not heard of seasoning? Finally, the toast was standard, but they only had welch's grape jelly on the table.... for 10$ a plate I should get some nice jam... or at least a choice. So overall, mine was a train wreck.   The BF got the blueberry pancakes that are supposedly so good.... they aren't. They were soo sweet... disgustingly sweet. They drench the pancakes in blueberry sauce of sorts and it is just super sweet... like sweeter than a regular cake or pie.... I know pancakes are supposed to be sweet, but this was too much.   The only good part about it was the coffee, they do have good coffee. So if you want good coffee and hate having flavor in your food or money in your wallet... this is the place for you! You can find me up a few blocks north at the much better breakfast establishments on Gilbert rd.

I typically would not write a review based on a Yelp event where I had the chance to try the food for free, but I just cannot hold back when it comes to this shop. The chocolate here is ridic. It is so good. I want to go back now....and tomorrow......and everyday. I won't, because no matter what Julia says, you can't eat this stuff everyday and be in good shape. Anyway, the chocolate martini may be the best drink I've ever had....so rich and delicious. The cakes were all good, but the chocolate mousse with the hazelnut was just insanity. I cannot wait until I can go back and have some more of this crazy delicious dessert....this may be my new fave dessert in the desert!

Alright! Finally good Chinese around my house.... I have looked at reviews for this place before but got scared of going here because I thought the menu was only in Chinese (for some reason). So one of my friends suggested this place after discussing which type of Asian food we wanted to try for lunch. So I looked at the reviews again and realized I was being dumb and their menu is in English along with Chinese. So I was excited to try it. The place is nothing special, like others have stated, but it's not unpleasant by any means. After considering the reviews, I decided to get dry beef chow fun. I also ordered hot tea. My friends got pork chow fun (wet), chicken chow mein, and the spare ribs over rice. Holy crap, the spare ribs were delicious! So tender and flavorful and cheap! My food was really good too. The meat was very soft, not chewy like at a lot of Chinese restaurants. It had good flavor and consistency. My tea was good too, they gave me a whole pot for a dollar. Nice! The chow mein was also really good, it had those crispy bird's nest like noodles. Man, those are soooo good. I wish all restaurants offered this. So anyway, I will definitely be back to try more dishes.... I really want to try the wonton soup and the chili dumplings (so cheap... whoa... none of our meals cost more than ten dollars). So thanks ACE! I now have a go to place by my house for yummy cheap Chinese food.

Ok... so I know I only went here a few days ago.... but hey! I'm sick and in need of lots of asian soup. So the BF and I went here tonight to get some cheap foods and it just didn't measure up to last time. We got the chili dumplings and I thought they were just ok.... I couldn't taste the meat over the chili, so I didn't really like that....the pork flavor is the best part! Next time maybe I'll go for regular pork and veg dumplings. The BF, however, really liked the dumplings so to each his own. We also got a spring noodle soup due to its cheapness and simplicity. Well now I know why it is so cheap. First off, I was expecting an individual sized soup... like a cup, cuz it cost 2$, but no... it was a giant bowl! Normally I wouldn't complain, except that the food inside the bowl wasn't very good or flavorful. The noodles were like thick spaghetti.... mushy and flavorless. The broth was also quite bland.... just a bit salty. And that's all there was. So, I know it's probably my fault and a misunderstanding, but I thought even though it said it had no meat and no veg,  it would still have some kind of seasoning. I wish they would serve a really good flavorful broth with more delicate noodles.... still no meat or veg.... for the same price... and just make the portion a normal portion for one person. Anyway, it's not that big a deal, I just wouldn't order that item. We also got the black bean spare ribs which were ok, but not as good as the other day when I tried my friend's spare ribs.... maybe due to them being busy. I think they just put too much black bean sauce on today and it made it kind of salty. Soooo tonight's visit gets an 'ok' but since the other day's visit was so good, I evened them out and went with four stars.

I went into Bangz about a month ago for a consultation and was so lucky they got me in the same day. Brian did my cut and color and he was amazing! My hair is the best it has looked in years, and everyone noticed. His cut and color has lasted fabulously too, my hair looks as good as it did the first day now (over a month later). The color hasn't faded or turned weird colors. He really knows how to work with curly hair...my curls haven't been this perky and pretty for so long, and his color work also helped highlight the curls. I will definitely be back when I need my hair done again (which probably won't be for awhile since he did such a great job!)

This place was hopping at lunch time last friday! The restaurant is really nice looking, with a lot of natural sunlight. I went with my dad and we split the chicken flat bread and the braised beef sandwich with the quinoa side salad. It was a lot of food! we ended up taking half of it home. Anyway, I thought the sandwich was good, but could have used some veg or something on it so it wasn't just meat and bread. In addition, the flatbread was good, but could have used more flavor too! It has really delicious caramelized onions, which gave it the majority of its flavor, but it could have had more seasoning or a sauce of sort.... The quinoa salad was really good, I would definitely eat that again. Also, the service was very attentive, when my dad went to the bathroom, the server came over and refolded his napkin.... kind of weird, but nice I suppose. Overall, I thought it was good, my dad liked it more than I did, and I would like to try this restaurant again.

What a cute little restaurant! The husband and I came here to get dessert and coffee one night and it was lovely. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake board.... it was so crazy good, maybe one of the best desserts I've had in Phoenix (maaaaybe). It's a delicious, dense, chocolate cake (and a large piece too!), with an espresso mascarpone topping and 3 other toppings in small containers. The toppings were raspberries macerated with mint, strawberries, and some kind of brittle. The cake with the cream and the raspberries was pure gold. I would come here just for this again. Also, the coffee was delicious and the cream came in a cute mini milk bottle (aww). The only downside was the service was a little inattentive, especially for such a small place. Anyway, I would like to come back to try their other food!

I went here tonight for dinner with my mom and sister in law. The place was totally empty when we got there, but had a few tables filled when we left. When we were waiting we had some very delicious oniony bread with balsamic and oil. I ordered the creamy garlic chicken pasta which had a very tasty sauce, but the chicken was just alright...kind of dry. BUT it was super inexpensive in comparison to dishes like this at other places. My mom had the broccoli on fussili pasta which was decent, but not terribly flavorful and my sister in law had a panini that she said was good, but I didn't try. The food here is decent and it is convenient for after a movie, but it isn't the best restaurant in town. Still, it would be nice to have more people come here and less people go to the chilis next door.

I was not impressed by Salon Izzy. I went in a couple weeks ago for cut, color, brow wax from Ruth. This salon is not what I call 'nice.' It is not modern and it has no style. It looks like a Regis or something, which makes sense since all of the stylists I talked to there used to work for Regis or beauty supply store salons... great. The people in this salon did not seem to get along. There were more than one disagreements and people stepping on each others' 'turf' while I was there. Ruth seemed 'off' after receiving a (very helpful and probably needed) coloring tip from another stylist... I later found out that she was very upset by this. Further, there isn't a receptionist in this salon (as far as I can tell) and Ruth answered several phone calls and text messages while I was in the chair. Unprofessional. There was a time when Ruth had the color brush and hair in one hand and was texting with the other. Wow. Ruth had a cancellation and then called another client who then also cancelled and she was clearly stressing... I probably should have left too.   Anyway, Ruth's mentor (Donald... I think) was a nice guy and helped out (more than he probably should have had to ), but I didn't like that he and Ruth gossiped about other clients and stylists while I was there. If they are talking about these people, what will they say about me after I leave? So unprofessional. The hair cut I received and the color is decent, but I was concerned because A) Ruth cut my hair while it was curly, so if I were to straighten it, I doubt the cut would be straight....not a real issue since I wear it curly, but something to think about and B) Ruth didn't style my hair at all or offer to, so it was pretty hard to see what the cut was going to look like. I had to go into the bathroom to re-wet my hair to see what it might look like.... that really isn't acceptable. My Mom also had her hair cut and colored and Ruth accidentally turned her hair purple. My mom is fairly cool, so she went with it, but that is also not acceptable. To her credit, Ruth offered to redo it if she was unhappy with it in the next few days.   So lastly, Ruth did my eyebrows. I wouldn't normally have my eyebrows waxed at a hair place, but I needed them done and she offered to do them for free for my birthday (which was the next day). All seemed fine until I got up and looked in the mirror. She had waxed off half of one of my eyebrows! Before I could say anything, Ruth said 'I didn't wax off your eyebrow, your hair is just light!' Ummm I have been having eyebrow waxes for 13 years and my hair has never been so light....it was so light, it was nonexistent! I was pretty furious and got out of there as fast as I could. As we were leaving, Ruth sat in her chair and texted. She did not apologize. I would not recommend her to anyone and I certainly will never go back.   I guess you really do get what you pay for.

I went here yesterday morning for brunch with my dad on my birthday and I thought it was really special. The farm is pretty, it feels like you are out of Phoenix for a minute. The food was excellent! We shared the cowboy eggs (or something like that) and the french toast. The cowboy dish was amazing, it is a big bowl of delicious, well seasoned, slightly spicy chili with two over easy eggs on top and two pieces of toasted and buttery bread. I thought it was a real gem. The french toast was also very very good. I am not super into sweet breakfast, but I might make an exception for this. The toast had a crispy outside and a soft inside, was covered in syrup and some kind of flavored butter, and topped with nuts...it was crazy good....I only deducted a star because it was my first time coming there and the place is a bit expensive, but there is no question I would come back here again. In fact....I want to go back right now!   Oh, Tip: I saw the parking lot across the street from the farm and parked there BUT it is a long walk from there to the restaurant and there is closer parking...just not a ton of it.

After failing to get to a different restaurant in this neighborhood before they close, Monica O and I found ourselves at Middle Eastern, and I'm glad we did! This little grocery/restaurant is very cute with friendly staff and delicious food. I had trouble making up my mind (what's new?) and the lady behind the counter helped me.. I had the falafel pita.... it had fresh crisp lettuce, slice onion, tomato, and teeny tiny delicious falafel inside... oh and some kind of magic sauce. Wonderful! I also got to try the hummus, which was extremely tasty. Now, you may wonder how I got out of there without ordering a dessert as they all looked insanely tasty... I didn't see them until after I paid (ha!). Anyway, I will definitely be back here!

I went here tonight with the BF as we had a groupon. We ordered soo much dessert for 10$! We got espresso and creme brulee gelato which was excellent! They had a lot of flavor and was creamy and delicious. We shared a latte which came in a real glass (a clear glass glass) and was beautiful. It had a few cookies on the side and came on a cute little plate. The only thing that we weren't huge fans of was the tiramisu. I was especially excited for it, but wasn't a huge fan. Overall, the service was friendly and the gelato and coffee was good, so it deserves 4 stars.

Claim Jumper is one of those chain restaurants that gives you giant portion sizes, but the food really isn't anything to rave about. I went here with a few friends last Saturday after we had our comprehensive exam and it was just alright. I really wanted to order a soup and salad, but that lunch special is only offered on weekdays (which is weird...people don't want to eat something lighter on the weekends? hmmm) and in order to get soup and salad, even ordering the smallest portion sizes would have been around 13$ (which is ridiculous). So I ended up ordering the tomato flatbread appetizer and a cup of the potato soup. The flatbread was fine, nothing to get too excited about, but not bad. It had sundried tomatoes on the top and was a little garlicky. The soup, on the other hand, was not good. It was the weirdest tasting potato soup I have ever had. It had carrots in it and it just tasted almost sour. It started to separate (I could see the cream and the grease) before I stopped eating it about halfway through. My friends got sliders and sandwiches, which I guess is the way to go here  because they said it was fine, I just wish they had some half portion options or smaller salad/soup options for more reasonable prices for the kind of restaurant this is....a national chain.

I came here a couple weeks ago to get some coffee after hearing good things about this place. The coffee was just not very good. It didn't have a lot of flavor and just was meh. I might have high expectations after living in Seattle, but this coffee wasn't even as good as dunkin donuts.... so.... I'd pass.

I went to Switch yesterday for happy hour with a friend. We sat in the bar and had fairly good service. I had the margarita sunrise, which was on happy hour for only 3$. It was really good! Lime, strawberry, and orange flavors layered.....pretty great idea. My friend was a little disappointed because their beer list on their website is inaccurate and they don't have any beer on tap, but that's not that big of a deal. We shared the bruschetta and the dragon pita. The bruschetta came in two varieties, a classic tomato and basil and a less classic pimento pepper, artichoke spread, and cheese...both were very tasty. The pita had a really great sauce on it that had a sesame -y flavor and the mint on the sandwich added a fresh flavor to it, but I was a little disappointed because the menu stated it had avocado on it and ours did not. Not the worst thing in the world, but still not how I think it should be. Overall, I did like this place and I would definitely come back here again, especially for happy hour.

I love Bill's! I stayed here in the summer (I know, took me awhile to review) but it was perfect. The room was clean and large, with a big screen plasma tv. The bed was comfortable. The location was perfect, right in the middle of the strip AND I only paid 35$ a night. The only time I've ever gotten that kind of deal was in Mexico city... The casino is nothing special, but who cares? I don't have to gamble there. I recommend this place to anyone going to Vegas. I'll certainly stay here again next time.

Ok...I know you've heard it before...but the lentil soup is a definite 5 star! It is absolutely delicious...so much so that I wanted to lick the bowl...but I didn't, I just spoon licked it instead (you know....scraping and scraping until it's gone?)...yum. The other food that my friend and I got was good, but not even close to as good as that soup (which is definitely what I'm getting next time). I got the chicken biryani and my friend got the chicken curry. My chicken was good...it was a little spicy, but also a little sweet with a cinnamon -y flavor to it. My friend's curry was a typical curry...nothing terribly special. The service here was super slow...we waited like 20 minutes to even get water....which is unfortunate, but I can kind of understand it because it is only one girl running the whole front of house and she was busy. Despite this, it was still frustrating to just sit there and wait for so long. However, the good did outweigh the bad and I always like to go to family run restaurants, so I'll be back.

This bar is a cute little neighborhood bar. Very relaxed atmosphere. I went last night for Tuesday night trivia and it was really fun. I was glad to see it wasn't hosted by Team Trivia (who I do not like at all...) and the questions were good. The trivia master was a nice guy and very gracious to all of the people there. They had ok drink prices, with a 16 oz PBR for 2.50. I would come back here for trivia night again for sure.   PS Ace the puppy is adorable!

This place is really more like a 4.5 in my opinion. I just went there tonight for reverse happy hour/ dinner with the BF after both of us having school for around 12 hours today (ugh). We needed a drink. Well, we decided on Sakebomber because it is close to our house and because the place we were originally going to try (Saketini) didn't have reverse happy hour until ten. Anyway, I'm glad we gave this place a shot. It looked a little sketchy from the outside, but the inside was nice and comfortable. We got ID'd at the door and given bracelets, which was a bit weird, but fine with me. Also, the hostess was a really sweet girl, so it made it less weird. We were sat, and our awesome waitress, Joy, came by to get drink orders fairly quickly. The BF got a beer (asaki... I think) and I got the Bahama Mama on Joy's recommendation. They cost 4 and 5$ respectively. My drink was wonderful! It was all banana-y and coconutish and just delicious.   So we ordered cucumber rolls, gyoza, spring salad, and the chimichanga rolls. The BF liked the cucumber rolls (I didn't try them), The gyoza were clearly generic gyoza, but at least this place had good sauce and they were crispy, which was pleasant. The salad was alright, a bit too peppery, but good and fresh tasting.   So chimichanga rolls you may ask. They are rolls that have fried chicken (true story), avocado, jalapeno, rice, cream cheese, wrapped in seaweed and then the whole thing is fried and served with habanero sauce. This sounds like a food eaten on dare or thought up by a very drunk person. Good for them, though, because these were wonderful!!!! I have never enjoyed a sushi roll, mainly because I do not usually like the flavor of seaweed, but it was a lot more subtle in this roll (probably due to the deep fry) and I really liked them. The sauce was super yummy!   So we eat all of our food.....all of it..... and are still nursing our drinks, when Joy comes over and says 'oh, you're still drinking, would you like me bring you some free toasted marshmallows... I thought I heard wrong, but I did hear free, so I said.... ok..... She brought out these delicious toasted marshmallows on whipped cream with strawberry sauce. It was great!... albeit very weird.   The whole meal (two alcoholic drinks, gyoza, two sushi rolls, a salad, and a dessert) cost 30$. Overall, this place was great and I will most definitely be back with as many people as I can introduce to this great place!  Update: Went back tonight for a 'snack' and for the BF's dinner. Got the chimichanga roll..... Even better than last time, if that's possible! The more habanero sauce... the better! We also split the tempura ice cream.... Also super delicious. It's ice cream wrapped in cake and then fried with chocolate sauce and whipped cream on top.... yes it is as delicious as it sounds.  Oh... we had Joy again, and she rocks my socks! Probably the coolest waitress I've ever met, so major props on that!

I went here with my dad for lunch a few days ago and it was seriously tasty. We split the torta nortena with chicken and the chicken ranchera torta and both were delicious. My only complaint was the nortena's bottom half of the bread was soaked through so I had to eat it with a knife and fork, but the flavor was spicy and delicious. The ranchera was even better, it had a lot of flavor for being a more simple sandwich. I would definitely come back here again....

This place has definitely had some of the best thai food I have had in Phoenix....and it was hiding right around the corner from my house! Craziness! I went here today with a friend and got my standard order, drunken noodles at a 2 star due to the warnings of crazy spiciness. I think I could handle a 3 star, but it was decently spicy. I thought the flavors were good, the ingredients were tasty and it was cheap! 7$ for soup, spring roll, and a full plate of food. I'll definitely have to come here again (especially to try their desserts which are made in house...yum).

I went back here last night and it was awesome! Got the drunken noodles again, but I got it at 3 stars and it was plenty spicy....my nose was running, but it was perfect. The dish had a lot of flavor (other than just spicy) and it still tasted fresh and delicious. I brought a couple friends and they both enjoyed the food very much. This is definite my new go to Thai place.

Hooray for 100 reviews in 2014! Anyway, I have passed by this park for years, always thinking that it was not very nice and writing it off based on how it looked from the perimeter. I was so wrong!  The park is large, has a nice water feature (which you can't see from the outside), and hills that provide nice views of the rest of the park. I went to yoga rocks the park here last weekend and it was so much fun, definitely a great event. This park was a nice venue for an event like this because there was plenty of room and the environment was beautiful. I would like to come back to further explore what this park has to offer.

I have gone to the festival for the past two years and I went with a few friends to the arts festival last Sunday and it was really nice. This festival is large and has LOTS of vendors ( a lot who sell similar stuff, but then many who sell cool and different things). This is such a fun activity to do on a sunny day like last Sunday, and the place has some really nice items for gifts that will be different than buying some garbage from walmart (I'm looking at you crazy black friday pepper spray lady...). You can sample some interesting foods and drinks, for example, I tried a wine slushy. It was....different. This is definitely an event worth attending.

Man. This place was so disappointing. I was trying to think of a place to eat breakfast this morning, and this place popped into my head. I don't know why, I think I had heard of it from someone, but anyway, we were in the neighborhood so we went.   That was the mistake.   We waited outside for about 20 minutes, which wasn't so bad, considering this place was on tv and whatnot. We got seated over by the wall... really close to the people next to us. The place was loud and the person sitting next to me was yelling the whole time... did not stop. We were basically sitting at the same table as this person so that was annoying. Not the restaurant's fault though.   So I ordered the chicken and waffles at the waiter's recommendation and the BF ordered pancakes and bacon. We both ordered coffee (2.25 for a cup of drip coffee?!?!?! how do they charge so much?). The coffee wasn't terrible, not great, but not bad, kind of metallic, also we didn't get a second refill on the coffee... cups stood empty. The waiter brought out a tiny thing of half and half but never refilled it (the coffee was much worse without cream). Our food came quickly. The chicken was a fried breast on top of a thin waffle. The chicken actually had decent flavor, but the waffle was completely tasteless, soggy, and detracted from the overall flavor of the food... useless calories.  So my food was not terrible... but not good by any means, and for 9$, it should have been good. The real reason for the one star was the BF's pancakes. WTF. These pancakes were terrible. They had no flavor and they were dry as could be. These pancakes were not as good as bisquick at home. They were not as good as the pancakes at mcdonalds. They were not as good as those frozen pancakes that you microwave. How did they make pancakes so bad? At a popular breakfast place no less. In addition, the syrup was in a squeeze bottle on the table... not heated up or anything. The syrup was flavorless as well... mrs. butterworth's is better. So gross. And the bacon (4$), was so small. 3 wimpy soggy slices that were not at all crispy. Then I got the bill. 25$. Wow. This place has some nerve charging that much for this poor excuse of a breakfast.   Never again, I would go get a frozen breakfast from the grocery store before I would come get food here again.

This place reminds me of Seattle. The coffee is very good and the decor is nice and feels like a 'real' coffee house, not a starbucks (ugh). I also like how it looks like it is going to be so small from the outside and when you walk in it is quite large with plenty of seating. I have been here a few times and the coffee is always good and the service is also good. The people who work here seem to know about coffee.

Ok, so I have been to Cartel many more times and discovered something a little strange. Their hot lattes are almost always very good.... BUT their iced lattes are really bad. I don't know how this is possible, but I do not like their iced lattes at all. Sad day for them. I still like that it's bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside and the vibe of the place is nice, but I am disappointed in this finding. They do have decent toddy and they have good chocolate croissants...mmmm. I will still come here, but maybe more often in the winter.

I went here the other day on my Coffee Tour O' Phoenix, FTW!!! I tried to go last Sunday, but they don't open til late on Sunday (I would think this would lose them a lot of business... but whatever, that's their choice). So I went here with the BF yesterday morning to get some coffee and pastry before I had to go to school. The place is pretty cute inside, I really like their couch and fancy chairs, the rest of the furniture looks like it came from Ikea, but whatever, Ikea is cool. We went up and ordered a couple of lattes, a chocolate croissant, and a cranberry scone. Healthy. ha. So we waited a bit and then the barista called us up to get our drinks. It was so weird cuz the hot lattes come in glass cups... like beer cups. I found it strange... but I guess that doesn't matter. The lattes were good, not as good as my go to (cartel) but still good. The pastries were also yummy. The croissant was delicious and the scone was just ok, but quite large, I couldn't finish it. So this place is definitely a winner on the tour in comparison to some of the places I've been to which have been nothing exciting. There were a bunch of people there that all knew each other but didn't sit together, that was kind of weird.... I could see myself coming back here again when I want to mix things up.

I first went to crust over 5 years ago and the food has always been fairly good. After the disaster that was the street eats festival today, I was happy to go eat lunch at Crust instead. I went with the BF and another couple (Erin B and her BF). We all shared the meat and cheese plate, which was good, but nothing extraordinary. We each got a rustica pizza and they were all really good, I got the classic, the BF got the New York, Erin got the one with pesto and bacon, and her BF got the meat. These pizzas are a funny shape, but still tasty. We didn't have the best service today....our water was empty through most of the meal, but generally the service is good. I do wish they would bring back the 'pot brownie'....a brownie in a metal pot with banana, nuts, ice cream, whipped cream....completely delicious and amazing....how can that not be on the menu???? Overall, a pretty solid pizza place.

I have been to the Rum Bar a few times in the past few weeks. They have some pretty interesting cocktails. I have had the watermelon cocktail, pina colada, rum punch, their mixed punch stuff that's on the counter, and the strawberry basilica. My favorite was definitely the watermelon. Soooo good....it is sweet, yet light and refreshing. The pina colada is a little too rich for me, as they use coconut milk in it. The strawberry is very good, sweet, but clearly alcoholic. The punch that was on their counter last night was excellent! It tasted like clove and fruit....really interesting. Overall, this place is great, but here is my gripe- last night we wanted to get some food, but we were informed that they don't serve anything but apps in the bar area or outside and we couldn't get a table in the restaurant for another 2 hours or so. The waitress told us that they have a very small kitchen and that's why they do that. We were fine with ordering apps and got the scallops, the prawn flatbread, and the avocado spring rolls. The portion sizes were SO SMALL! and the prices were SO high. For $12.50 we got 2 scallops (after being told that they were good to share). Kind of ridiculous. The scallops were excellent! But I wanted more than one bite for the price. The prawns were just alright and were more like a dip with pieces of bread than what I would typically think of when hearing flatbread (aka pizza).  The spring rolls had a decent flavor but were mushy. I will be back for drinks, but I wouldn't order appetizers again. I felt kind of ripped off. I also am not sure why they can make these appetizers in their small kitchen and can't make some rice and beans or curry for the small amount of people in the bar.....oh well.

Ok, I was a bit harsh last time (to be fair, that salad was really something awful). I have been back once for just appetizers and again last night for a dinner date with the BF. Both times have been Fan - Tastic!!! Last night we started with the scallops and a couple of drinks. The scallops were amazing. Spicy and perfectly cooked. The portion is a bit small, though, for the price (2 big scallops for 12$). I ordered the pork belly and it was tender and delicious. It came on top of a white bean mash with a sweet and spicy sauce. SO Good!!! The BF got the jerk pork with polenta. OH Em Gee.... I could eat that everyday (but I wouldn't...of course.... *looks around*). It was spicy...spicy enough to make my nose run a little. It was flavorful...smoky, spicy, and savory. The polenta was the perfect side to go with the meat too. *droooool* For dessert we had the chocolate and orange souffle.... The souffle was very good...molten and delicious chocolate with just enough orange flavor...but the thing that made it...rum whipped cream. Yes, you read it right....RUM whipped cream!!! It was perfect with the souffle and just such a good idea overall. Yes, it is expensive, but I had a fabulous time there, it is cute and intimate, and the food is awesome. The service is great, attentive, but not too attentive. I will definitely be back.   PS be sure to make reservations...this place is tiny and gets booked up.

I went here tonight with the BF to use a Groupon.... what a disappointment! I had heard that this place was so good... but really.... not awesome. The chips and salsa were ok, but not anything too special. I started with the supposedly amazing corn chowder.... bland and the chicken in it had a weird texture. Not my cup of tea... or soup, as it were. I ordered the double stack pork adovado enchiladas 'christmas' style... with green and red sauce. Well.... I'm not sure if there was any sauce on it.... there certainly wasn't any spice, I thought it was New Mexican food? No flavor or spice here. The pork was ok.... but again, not very flavorful. The BF just got a cheese crisp. It was soggy, flavorless, and pathetic. If it is an old family recipe, as the menu claims.... that family is probably pretty boring. To top it all off, the service was sloooow. I will not be back, sorry guys!

I went here for breakfast the other day and it was VERY good! I was on the fence about going here, but decided to give it a shot, which turned out well. The place was pretty empty, but it was a weekday, so that is to be expected. Our waitress who may or may not have been the owner (she was French), was attentive. The BF and I shared a chocolate croissant and it was delicious! I like how it was sweet but in a subtle way. I had the egg sandwich, and, unfortunately, they were out of butter croissants, so I had the sandwich on french bread. The bread was good, but I can only imagine how good the croissant would be. The sandwich came with a small salad that had the most flavorful balsamic dressing....so good and also came with very crispy, almost like shoestring fries, hashbrowns. All was wonderful. The BF had the nutella crepe and it was light and fluffy with, again, a subtle sweetness. I need to try this place again before I can give them a 5 star....but it really was yum to the extreme....  PS I really want to try their lunch (the sandwiches look great) and their desserts (I think I got fat looking at their display case...but so worth it)

I have been to this discount tire twice and both times have been amazing! The first time, I had a tire that would consistently lose pressure. I took it in, they found a nail, removed the nail and patched the tire for....free! Yes free! And they gave me a water bottle! Amazing. So, of course, I remembered this kindness when I needed a new tire and returned. Discount makes the process easy, you can go on their website, put in your car and it will tell you what tires you need and give you different brand/price options. You can complete the entire process online, make an appointment, and head in to the store when you're ready. Additionally, if you make an appointment, they don't make you wait longer than 45 minutes. In my case, I got there about 25 minutes early, and they completed the work on my car by my appointment time....and it wasn't like they weren't busy....awesome!!! Their prices are similar to anywhere else. I would highly recommend discount for your tire needs!

I have been to La Bocca about 6 times, and each time this place has been very good. I have tried several pizzas, several salads, the antipasto plate, and the bruschetta. All have been really tasty. So I went here tonight with the BF before we went to see Stephen Hawking for his birthday (the BF's, not SH's). We went for happy hour, intending to just get a bruschetta plank, but ended up being super hungry and getting a bunch of food. We were seated right away, which was nice. For happy hour, all wine and beer by the glass is half off. We ordered some wine, I got the Riesling and he got the pinot grigio. I really liked the riesling and he liked the pinot, but I wasn't a fan. To each his own though. So we ordered the bruschetta plank with the prosciutto, fig, and mascarpone, the tomato, mozz, basil, and balsamic, the pulled pork and peston, and the garlic, arugula, and goat cheese. They were all excellent. So in comparison to Postino, I'd say these are on par (with the tomato and mozz one being way better here). Plus we didn't have to wait forever for the food. Each piece of bruschetta is smaller than the ones at postino though. We ended up ordering a margherita pizza. This was so good, it was exactly what I expect in a good margherita pizza. It had whole leaves of basil and the mozz clearly came from a ball of cheese and not shredded cheese. It all tasted really fresh. I thought this pizza was much better than the Marg. I got at Classic Italian Pizza a few weeks ago. The crust was a lot less burnt and the toppings tasted fresher. Then, cuz it's the BF's Bday, we got an order of tiramisu. Mmmmm this was so good! The tiramisu did not have an overwhelming alcohol flavor, but a very light coffee flavor that was very tasty. It had a really good sized piece of tiramisu with two little wafers in it and some chocolate sauce and raspberry sauce on the side. It was excellent! This was one of the best meals I've had in awhile, and I don't know if it was the wine, but this was also the best meal I've had at La Bocca.

This pizza is great, I just wish they were open more often. I have only had their pizza once, but have tried to have their pizza 4 times. They are closed at (my) dinner time, and I keep forgetting (silly me). If you can get it, their pizza is some good stuff. Also, everyone who works there are super sweet! Plus they have pinball which rocks my socks.

I used to go to AJ's all the time as a kid and two of my brothers worked at the one on lincoln when they were in high school. Always good memories.... so more recently I ordered a cake from AJ's for a birthday party and they made it really beautiful. The flavor was good ( It was the chocolate raspberry cake).... not the best cake I've ever had (... would have been better if it had a real raspberry jam type filling instead of raspberry flavored whip cream or whatever was in there), but it looked great and it was definitely better than most other grocery store cakes.It served it's purpose and I would probably buy another cake here again. Plus their chocolate croissants are bomb. I only wish I could go here to shop... but man, too pricey.

What a fun place to eat! This conveyor belt sushi bar is on the casual side and is quite popular. We went fairly early on a Sat (5:30 ish) and there were probably 15 people waiting for a spot. We didn't wait too long though, maybe 15-20 min. After being seated, you can begin eating immediately... well, as soon as something you like comes around the belt. There is a small sign before a series of plates with the name of what is on the plates- I wish it also had a small description since there were a few things that I wasn't familiar with and couldn't find online (mountain potato roll... tasty, but I have no idea what was in it). I liked that each plate only has 4 or so pieces, allowing you to try many different items and minimizes the risk of trying new things. Additionally, their prices are very reasonable, with no plates costing more than 2$. We enjoyed the mtn potato roll, the seared tuna, gyoza, inari, asparagus rolls, cream puffs (yuuuummm)... most everything. The edamame was kind of a waste... not salted, with some pods empty when we got them. Additionally, we didn't care for the vegas roll. Overall, we really enjoyed this place and would come back if we were in the neighborhood.

I went on this hike with the hike and brew UYE group...which was awesome! This is not close to my house and therefore would never be a regular hike for me. Despite this, the facilities are very nice, there are nice places to take a  break along the trail. So why not 5 stars? It was really easy.... all of the switchbacks make for a pretty flat hike and when you get to the 'highest point' there is no view....what's up with that? The actual peak isn't accessible via the trail and obscures your view of the city....not awesome. I was pretty disappointed. The backside of the hike is a little more of a challenge than the front but still nothing too difficult. I guess it is a testament to my personality, but I like a hike that goes straight up to the top of the mountain so I can get a good view and a good workout and be done with it.... maybe I have no patience, but if you are like me, this may not be the hike for you. Otherwise, this is a pretty nature hike that is fairly easy, so go for it!

I went to Maizie's for the first time last Friday night after having wanted to try it for awhile. I just went for happy hour, but I was less than impressed. Let me say that the parking is horrible, there are very few spots, there are restrictions on most of the spots...it was a mess. I got Sangria, the husband got a beer (3$ each on HH) and we split the buffalo chicken dip at the waiter's suggestion. The dip was pretty lackluster...very oily, weirdly chunky, and highly acidic.... not something I would want again. The sangria was also extremely mediocre. Kind of just tasted like red wine. The worst part was that after drinking half of it a fly died in the sangria. The husband called attention to this to the waiter who responded 'what do you want me to do about it?' Well....not really a professional response. Then he proceeded to say ' I can bring you something to fish it out with...' Really?? Wow. I understand if they don't replace it as a policy (their patio had TONS of flies (gross) so it probably happens a lot), but he should say it with a little more decency.... try 'I'm sorry, unfortunately we can't replace it, could I get you another one?' or something along those lines. Anyway, I couldn't get out of here fast enough and I won't be returning.

I really like the Cracker Barrel for breakfast, mainly because it holds a lot of people so there's never a really long wait and it's cheap. Like dirt cheap. You cannot go out to breakfast for less except maybe at the waffle house. This place is far superior to the waffle house. I haven't been here for any other meal, but the breakfast is good. It is a chain, but when you don' want to spend a lot, it's a good option. Also, they have eggs in a basket... I loved that as a kid! props to that.

I went to Eddie's House last night with the BF and two friends for restaurant week and it was a terrible experience. First of all, I had made a reservation for 7:30 more that a week in advanced and we waited until 7:50 to be seated. This was a bad omen, because, as it turns out, the whole night was made up of waiting. Our waiter (who did not share his name, unfortunately because I would tell anyone to avoid him at all costs) was terrible. TERRIBLE. He came by 4 times before taking our order when we were ready after 5 minutes. Each time was a weird excuse. First time he came by I asked for a restaurant week menu, he said 'a restroom menu?' Why would I say that, then I ordered a glass of moscato and he's like the XXXX (whatever brand it was) and i looked down and it was the ONLY moscato.... I was like ya... WTF? So I screamed what I wanted and he's like oh.... sorry.... I can't hear. Then he said 'Oh hey, I'll be back to explain things.' Explain what? we're clearly ready! 'Oh hey, are you ready to order? Well let me go take the order of that big table back there and I'll be back to take yours' (real quote) WHAT? Seriously? We waited over 40 minutes to order. What's worse, is that we looked over like where the ef is this guy, and he was chatting at the bar!!! What, were we not wearing the right clothes? Were we not hip enough to be served? Or was it that we were ordering off the restaurant week menu, are we not ordering enough to get service? Come on.   So he finally took our order, and we each ordered all three courses at once, because who knew when he would decide to come back. We got drinks, everyone got beer, except me who ordered the moscato. This was good, but was served in basically a thimble, it was the smallest glass of wine I have ever seen. Then we waited... and waited... and waited. We ate the whole basket of bread (which was great, but overshadowed by our terrible service). We got our appetizers, we had at least one of each available (a peach soup, a salmon flat bread, and a fetoush salad). The soup was really weird, not bad, just different. The salad was overpoweringly oniony, but still tasted good, although it was supposed to have toasted pita and had one tiny piece... and supposedly the flat bread was good, but I don't like salmon, so I didn't try it. Then the waiter came by and said 'oh we're really busy tonight, that's why it's taking a long time for the food) Notice there was no apology or accommodation of any kind. He also asked if we wanted bread with dinner, we said yes, but no bread ever came... weird.   We waited and waited and finally out food came. I ordered the chili chicken, the two boys ordered the meatloaf, and my other friend ordered the shrimp. I thought the chicken had a good flavor, but was really dry. The meatloaf was fantastic! It was really quite delicious, with onion strings, mushroom jus, and mashed potatoes... yum. Supposedly the shrimp were really spicy, but again, I didn't try it. We ate everything, so again, the food was good, the service was awful.   So then the waiter comes by (about 10-15 min after we had finished) and says, oh do you still want dessert? um.... yes, we ordered it and it comes with our meal.... he says 'oh, cuz I think we just ran out of the pot de creme, but I'll look' Well two people had ordered the pot de creme TWO HOURS AGO!!!! Why weren't they left aside? 'Oh we had 200 more people show up tonight that expected' Well, We had a reservation, so it is not our fault that you cannot staff your restaurant appropriately or turn away customers when you are too busy to handle new diners. It does not make sense. What kind of greedy restaurant is this that they can't refuse a table when people who told them they came to eat there can't even get anything off the dessert menu. It turned out they had one left, then the other person who ordered it said, oh ok, i'll have the peach crisp then....'oh, well we're out of that too cuz like it's made fresh from peaches and we didn't buy enough for all of the extra people....'   Maybe if we had been served in a TIMELY manner instead of over two and a half hours, they wouldn't have run out. Oh, and maybe if the jerk who was our server had put aside the desserts for us when we ordered it over TWO HOURS before the time when we actually got dessert, that would have been nice too. The desserts were good, the pot de creme was the best, the rest of us got a 'tiramisu' which tasted like cookie dough ice cream.... not exactly what I want in a tiramisu, but fine, I guess.   Finally, we get the check (around 200$, so clearly we didn't spend enough money to warrant any service) and we right out how we want the bill split between the two couples, The waiter comes by, and the BF starts saying, oh we wrote down the amounts we want on each card. The snarky jerk waiter says 'Oh, you mean follow the directions, ok.' So much attitude! So rude. I wish we left no tip, cuz that's what was deserved. NEVER AGAIN.

I went here with the BF and a couple of our friends tonight for dinner and it was mighty tasty. I'm very glad I looked at Yelp before going so I knew where this place was because otherwise I would've been very lost. The place is extremely small which makes it slightly uncomfortable (like everyone can hear your conversation and you are sitting very close to other parties) but don't let this scare you off because the food is very good. They give you free bruschetta (essentially) which I thought was the best part of the whole meal....so good! The bread was light and delicious and the topping was vinegary, oniony, and fresh tasting....super yummy. We all kind of shared food, the BF and I got the meatball pizza which was tasty, but a bit heavy on the meatball (can I even say that? ha...) it was thin sliced pieces of meatball on top of a basic cheese pizza. The crust is very good and the sauce is also very fresh tasting. The pizza could have used some basil or something to make it have more depth of flavor, but it was good as is. We also shared the gnocchi which are made in house and were light, airy, and delicious! I love eating places that make their cheese and pasta in house....very cool. Our friends got the penne with vodka sauce which was super bacon -y but good. I couldn't eat a whole plate of it (too heavy) but it is extremely flavorful. They also got a pizza and really enjoyed it. Although I wouldn't say this place is the best pizza in town, it is very good and I would love to eat here again.   PS: the prices are awesome!!! So many quality ingredients for so little money....excellent!

The BF and I got coffee here last night as part of the coffee tour of Phoenix!!. The coffee was alright, not too acidic, but not the most flavorful coffee, but the main reason for the 4 star review is they are open late and they deliver! How awesome! The people who work there were all friendly. The ice cream looked good...will have to try in the future.

Whoa. This was some good stuff. I went here on sunday with my mom and my sister in law because I had a groupon. I am soooo glad I bought that Groupon! The three of us shared two sundaes, one java brownie and a build your own sundae with banana foster ice cream and a strawberry and cream flavor with chocolate sauce and a toasted marshmallow. I wanted to get the toffee banofi, but my mom didn't want it... so next time for sure. The owner (?) told me that I had made a mistake in not ordering that one... we'll see. The java brownie was soo good, the brownie pieces were delicious, you know how usually brownies in sundaes are all chewy and not very tasty? well that's my experience anyway. This was not like that. The brownies melted in your mouth and had so much flavor. Oh, and the whip cream.... It tastes like real cream, not too sweet, just rich and delicious. The other sundae was also amazing! The banana ice cream tasted so good with the chocolate and the marshmallow was one of the best marshmallow I have ever had. Crunchy and gooey. Yum! You should go there right now. Seriously. Go. Now.

I really like Abby Bella! They offer a lot of different classes and it is really great in comparison to going to the gym. I had bought a Living Social deal that got me an unlimited month of classes. I really liked how I could schedule my classes online. This made it very convenient for me. This location was pretty far from my house, and I also got a more snooty vibe here than what I got at the Arcadia location, but they offer a wider variety of classes here. I took a really good pilates class here, that only had about 5 people in it, so I got a lot of individual attention (whether that is good or bad...haha). In addition, I took a belly dancing class here once, on a rainy night, that started at 8 pm, and I was the only one there! Jasmine was really nice, and I said I didn't have to stay, but she gave me a one on one lesson for an hour. That was incredible... even though I felt like I looked really stupid and I couldn't hide in the back..... but still, she was really sweet about it. They also have burlesque class, which was really fun, a lot more exercise than I thought it would be. I didn't like the cardio strip class, I thought it was way too repetitive, we did the same dance about 15 times.... after awhile it just gets boring and it hurt my knees (a personal problem I guess). Overall, this place was really great though and I would love to come back here if they had another special or if I lived closer.

The BF and I went to a movie last night down at the Hollywood theatres and figured we'd get there a couple hours early and walk around..... wrong. There's not much around there. So we started driving south and stopped in the parking lot of Sushiya to figure out what to do. Well, we hadn't eaten yet, but only wanted something really light and decided to give Sushiya a try. I'm glad we did! The place was really busy, especially for 9 o clock at night. We ended up eating at the sushi bar, which was cool because we got to watch all the sushi be made. We just ordered a house salad, the inari and cucumber rolls. The salad was nothing special, just the typical salad. The real special thing was the inari.... it was the best I have ever tasted! They make what our Sushi chef called 'special rice' which has green onion and ginger in it. It made it have this perfect sweet and savory taste. I would come back just for that. The service was good and the sushi chef was friendly. Overall, it was a nice place..... I would go back just for the inari.... yum.

I'm sorry to be the first to really criticize this place....but it really was not good at all. I understand that it is a non profit place and it's there to help people, and that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one. The BF and I went here this morning to get our coffee fix and to try it for the coffee tour of phoenix! It was a huge disappointment. I ordered an iced latte and he ordered a hot latte. The hot latte had no foam. Both lattes had a very strange flavor. We had both asked for 2% milk, but it tasted like she used half and half? or a milk substitute? It had a weird 'fake' quality about it. Further, the coffee was just about nonexistent. It was like when I was a kid and my mom would put a teaspoon of coffee in my milk because I liked the flavor.... not what I'm looking for at a coffee place and not what we paid 4$ a drink for. We both ended up throwing away over half of our drinks because they were so bad. The place has a cute look, but I will never be back. Ugh.     PS It may be immature but I think it's funny that they have signs all around with their shortened name 'cok' heh. heh.

I was lucky enough to have a layover right next to this place. I have never been to North Carolina, but I want to go back if this is anything like the food offerings available I had the Cajun chicken biscuit and it was delicious. It was clearly fatty and totally bad for you (but what else would you expect?), but it was crunchy, hot, spicy, and the chicken was moist. I want another one right now. It was very good. This is definitely a great option if you're ever in this airport.

So, as you all know, BJ's is an unfortunately named chain restaurant. I went last night with the BF and his parents as it was his mom's birthday and that's where they wanted to go. It was actually a pleasant surprise! We all got drinks, I had the skinny -rita, which was really good, tart and fresh tasting. The BF got a snakebite, which was, as always, delicious. For dinner, I had the soup and salad with a caesar salad and tortilla soup. Going the 'healthy' route (I know this was not healthy in any way). The soup was very good and flavorful. They serve it 'fancy' style, putting chicken, avocado, tortilla, cheese, and bell pepper in the bottom of a bowl and then pouring the broth over the bowl table side. Nice touch. The salad was fair. Everyone else reported that they enjoyed their entrees. We had pizzookie for dessert, a half baked cookie with vanilla ice cream, delish. All of this for only 80$...pretty good deal. My only complaints are minimal and include: I wish they offered half portions at discounted prices....the portion sizes are way too big and there were a lot of things that looked good on the menu, but I wouldn't order them because I didn't want such a large portion. Also, this restaurant is busy and the wait to eat here is a little over the top....I wish that they took reservations. Overall, this place was good, especially for a chain.

So I went here for lunch the other day with a couple of friends. The food was really good, some of the best thai food I've had in phoenix. I got the drunken noodles and they had a bunch of delicious fresh vegetables and I ordered it medium spicy, and it really was a true medium spicy, not too weak and not too strong. The soup that comes with lunch is really weird... kind of sweet and kind of spicy.... not the best soup ever, so that knocked off a star, but other than that, I thought the food was very good. The prices were a little bit higher than at other Thai food places in the area, but I am willing to pay a bit more for better quality. I will definitely be back.

I was debating between 4 stars and 5 stars, but since this is my yoga place and I chose it over all of the others in Phoenix, I guess I think it's as good as it gets (haha, I really think about these things... wow). The girls that work at the front desk are always friendly. They have lots and lots of classes of all different types at all different times (I think upwards of 6 classes per day). There are definitely some teachers I like far FAR better than others (Danielle Godfrey... amazing, funny, challenging... I don't leave her classes without being challenged and without laughing... and Emily Stooks... Oh my god, can a yoga teacher get better than Emily? She ALWAYS provides individual attention, greeting each student, asking each students needs, adjusting, supporting, and pushing (just hard enough). Emily has one of those soothing voices that just make her seem completely sincere. I have never had the pleasure of practicing with a teacher better than Emily (and I have gone to A LOT of classes). Of course, there are other teachers that I don't care for or am neutral towards, but Urban, as a whole, is a great studio. They have two studio spaces... the one in the front is light and open, the one in the back is dark and more constricted, but good for relaxing classes. They have a store in the middle with tons of nice looking clothing and accessories including a large sale section (gotta love a good sale). They provide filtered water from a fountain and parking is free in the garage next to the building. This yoga studio really has something for everyone, give them a shot!

So here's the deal- I am on the fence about this review. The first time I had food from here it was ridiculously good. I had the chicken picado pita and everything about it was great. It was fresh, spicy, flavorful... just delicious in all ways. While eating leftovers of this sandwich the next day I think I said 'I could just eat this forever it's so good.' So, I return the next week, order the same thing but... no magic! It was still good, but not nearly as good as the first time. What's a girl to do? I'll probably give it another shot, but know that this place isn't very consistent.    Ps their greek salad is super yummy and the dressing is awesome.

I was really excited to try Noca after hearing so many good things about it. I bought the groupon for it as it was the only way I could afford this place and wanted to go for a late V day dinner with the BF. So we got there and, as others have said, it's in a strip mall, but it looks nice enough inside. We were seated and got the big bottle of water. They brought out an amuse bouche to start which was a blue cheese, apple, and nut... thing (hard to describe) and it was good despite neither of us being blue cheese fans. So I ordered the clam chowda soup to start and it was not so great. It didn't taste like any clam chowder I've ever had. It just kind of tasted like paprika.. and the potatoes were all thin and looked cute in the bottom of the bowl, but had no flavor as they would have had if they were cooked in the chowder. After the soup they brought a little taste of a parsnip soup. This was the best thing we had all night.... mmmm. For mains I ordered the hangar steak with carrots, broccolini, polenta, and some kind of wine reduction and the BF ordered a pork chop with rice, greens, and celery root puree. My food was good, the steak had good seasoning and the polenta was really good (when often it isn't that good). The broccolini tasted kind of weird though... like it was a little burnt. The bfs on the other hand was not so good. The pork chop tasted good at the beginning, but as he got closer to the bone it was basically raw. Like mushy and pink... not gonna eat that. Also the rice tasted dirty and weird. The puree was really good though. So then they brought out the cotton candy which was fine, but not necessary. For dessert we ordered sticky toffee pudding at the waiter's recommendation, and it was good. Very different than most desserts, so we appreciated that. So overall the service was really good, creepily good, our water was always full, but the food just didn't impress, especially for the price.    The BF picked up Filibertos on the way home... ha.

After being so disappointed last time I came here, I was hesitant to come back. However, they now have a different chef and I decided to give them a second chance for restaurant week. I went with a friend earlier this week. So for my three courses I got the bacon and eggs app, the short rib pappardelle, and the taste of sacher dessert and she got the salad, the braised pork, and the fritter dessert. They started by bringing madeleines, which tasted a bit like cornbread and were very tasty and an amuse bouche of spiced egg salad, which was bland at first taste, but had a really flavorful and spicy after taste. My app was very good, the egg was poached perfectly, the red pepper sauce was flavorful, and the bacon was tasty (I don't even generally like bacon...so that's a compliment). My friend said she liked her salad, but it seemed like a pretty simple salad. The short rib and pasta was very good. It had a creamy sauce and little croutons that added a nice crunch to the dish. The short rib was good, but could have been braised a bit longer (still had a little more solid fat than I like), but it was flavorful. The dish looked small, but it was very filling. The pork was just alright, it was braised but somehow it was a bit dry. The flavor was a little barbeque-like, it wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad. I would definitely go with the short rib over the pork. My dessert was good, it was like a dessert playground! It had little chunks of chocolate cake, which was a bit dry, but it was easily remedied by the delicious, rich, creamy chocolate mousse (or something...thought she said it was gelato, but if it was, it was the most creamy gelato I have ever had) and the raspberry frozen bits, the fresh raspberry, and the apricot sauce....on top of that, there were these little crispy chocolatey things on top of the cakes....so good! The fritters were just ok (in my opinion), go with the chocolate for sure. I think the cotton candy was alright, but kind of gimmicky, but I really like that they give you a little dessert to take home. Ok, so I was teetering between a 3 star and a 4 star review, but I decided for the restaurant week price (or the sunday supper price) this place is great! For their stated menu prices, not so much....It is not the best restaurant in Phoenix, but it is good, and I would like to come back and give it a third try.

Come here for happy hour. That is all.    Ok, that isn't all... come on. The husband and I came here for happy hour and it was lovely! We sat at the kitchen bar and got to watch them cooking all of the food, which was neat. (we also got to see the chef use a laser pointer to call his waiters... heh). They start you with delicious house made bread and butter... so good. For happy hour we had the cheeseburger with cheddar and bacon (7$) and the goat cheese and garlic pizza (7$ ish), a glass of wine (4.5$) and a beer (4$ ish). The burger looked great, but tasted just ok.... it wasn't anything terribly special. The pizza was delicious! It had a ton of goat cheese on it, big chunks of tomato, and perfectly roasted garlic... the pizza was a real winner. I would come back for the pizza for sure. If you are looking for a good happy hour, stop looking and check this place out.   PS they have a cute tapas menu now that seemed really nice, I would like to try this sometime too.

Palio had some very high highs and then some mediocres as well. The prices were a bit high, but the coffee was good, so I didn't feel bad about that. The chocolate croissant was boring and very average. The dulce de leche croissant was HUGE and delicious. The caramel was oozing out all over. It was messy and awesome and I would go back just for that. So go here, get the croissant and share it with someone because it is way too big for one person.

The BF and I went out tonight wanting a burger. We kind of wanted to sit somewhere, so the fast food places were eliminated. We decided to drive around Tempe Marketplace and see if there was somewhere to get a burger (man....west Mesa is devoid of good burgers....and good food). It was between here and Red Robin...we made the wrong decision. The place is kind of dark, like they are trying to be a fancy steakhouse when it is really a TGI Fridays or something like that. The BF got a cheeseburger and said it was meh. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was pretty lackluster. Not at all spicy. Not very flavorful.... just meh. It came with two sides and I got the snap peas and the mashed potato. The peas did not have snap, as they were cooked to death. The potatoes were ok, but not good enough to eat them all. The dinner wasn't terribly expensive...but not cheap. I wouldn't be back.

A friend and I ended up (accidentally) going on a slider tour of downtown the other night. District was our second stop. I was excited to try their sliders featured on happy hour that were described as Wagyu beef 'meatloaf' with root beer ketchup, spicy pickles, and shallots on a rye bun and were inexpensive at only $4.50. Unfortunately, they were not very good at all. They had a very off taste to them... hard to describe... but not juicy or flavorful... I couldn't even taste the ketchup... I don't think there were shallots on it... and when I bit into the slider, the meat was kind of mushy and fell out of the sides... pretty unappetizing. We also had the bacon wrapped dates, which were actually good (but it's hard to mess up dates wrapped in bacon). My friend had their special cocktail of the day, which was some peach concoction... it was pretty awful, extreme alcohol -y taste and generally not pleasant. Maybe their regular menu is better, but I don't think I would come here again to find out.    PS When we got there, we talked for awhile and then pulled out our phones to check in while we were waiting... the bartender came over and told us to put our phones away and enjoy each others company. I get that, but I think it wasn't his place to suggest it, especially since he had no idea what we were doing, how long we had been together, or the fact that we were checking in and that's it. I thought it was in poor taste.

I must say I was hesitant to even come to this restaurant when my step mom suggested it due to its low ratings. I am happy (or maybe sad?) to report that my step mom was right and Yelp was, well, not so much. This place was crazy good.... like, ridiculously tasty. The difference may be that we came at night and apparently at night they re-grill their chicken (at lunch they said they're too busy), which makes the chicken both tender and a little crunchy. We had the chicken plate and the chicken pita with a side of hummus. The chicken plate was the best item, with tasty rice and perfectly seasoned chicken. The pita was also exceptional, dripping with some kind of tasty sauce. Anyway, I would certainly come back!

I came to La's on a Saturday night with a friend at around 7. It was completely empty, which should have warned me, but we had already driven here and decided to stay. The food was less than amazing. I had the yellow curry, which was very soupy (no thickness to the curry) and my friend had pad see ew, which was dry and not very flavorful. The prices were on par with other Thai places (about 10$ pp). The food wasn't tasty enough to warrant a return trip.

I went here with a group yesterday to get our hair done for my friend's wedding. My girl did a great job, she did a nice, almost political, looking up do for me. She spent her time, but didn't take forever, which I appreciate. They did a good job on most of us, although my friend's mom wasn't happy with her hair despite having had a trial run there a few months ago. Despite that, most of us were happy with our up do's and my hair only cost 30$ and lasted all night, so I can appreciate that. If I lived closer, I would consider going here, but since I don't, I suggest you do!

Update: Chef Chris is awesome. He not only sent me a message late last night, but he called me this morning to personally apologize, talk with me about the experience, and insist I take a refund (which I did not want to take because there were a lot of positives about the experience that I thought were valuable). He really made me feel good about our experience and it is so rare for a person to be so mindful of his consumer and take the time to personally talk for ten minutes to make the situation right. That is very cool and makes me want to give this place another shot.   Review: I was trying to decide between two and three stars because we went here for our fancy anniversary dinner and I really REALLY wanted to love this place! Unfortunately, it was disappointing. I'll start with the positive stuff, because there were lots of positives- 1. Chef Chris was super nice and friendly 2. I love the environment, we sat on the patio and it was beautiful. The tables were candlelit, there was a pretty fountain, and I LOVED the little wood burning fireplaces and the nice smell that the wood gave off 3. A lot of the food was good. We started with a very tasty minestrone soup with home made crackers and the dessert (pumpkin cheesecake) was also wonderful! I also liked that they put mint in the water and the coffee was very good.   So now on to the not so great parts... So first, we had tried to go to this restaurant for my birthday in April, but a couple days before our reservation, the BF got a call saying that chef Chris had fallen ill and that we would not be able to have dinner there BUT that they would call us as soon as he came back to give us a reservation then. Well, I waited a month after my birthday... no birthday dinner.... cuz all I wanted was to go here. No call. The BF called and left several messages with no response. Then the message changed and they were closed for the summer and we went somewhere else. That was pretty bad. So now we got a res for our anniversary, and I was super excited but things went so wrong. The main dish was not at all impressive. I was told that one entree was chicken in a creamy sauce with black rice and spinach and I ordered that. The BF got a beef tenderloin with pesto, potato, and spinach. Well... they came out and my chicken and his steak were identical...both with pesto, spinach, grilled potato. That irked me a little bit, but I just figured that it was an honest mistake on the waiter's part. Then I took a bite of chicken and it had a gelatinous texture... I have never experienced that before, but I thought maybe it was just so juicy and I have never had chicken prepared in the same way before...Wrong. Then I took another bite and the texture was just weird. I tried to see if it was pink inside, but we only had the candlelight so I couldn't tell. Had the BF try it, and he said he thought it was underdone. Not a real awesome thing for chicken. So I sent it back and the waitress was very nice, apologized and took it. Chef Chris brought the new one out a few minutes later and was very sweet about it, which I appreciated. However, the chicken was not so awesome. Maybe I was just turned off to it or something... but it wasn't very appetizing. Anyway, it was kind of bland and the sides were not great... plain potatoes and raw spinach and tomato.... nothing special, and definitely nothing worth the price. The BF's steak was chewy but still better than the chicken, but essentially they tasted the same. The worst part, though, was unfortunately the service. I would understand the service being lackluster if chef Chris were doing it all himself, but with two people on waitstaff and only about 15 tables it was unacceptable. We were there for 2.5 hours, which would be fine if that was the intent of the restaurant..but I don't think it was. The first two courses were timely, but dessert was kind of a mess. We got some coffee...cute LARGE coffee cups, but not too much coffee in them and it wasn't hot, but it was tasty. We finished the coffee before we got our dessert. The waiter told us he'd bring some more coffee (us and the people next to us too) he came back a minimum of 3 times without refilling our coffee, probably more. I don't know if it was because there was a big table inside to tend to, but we did not get coffee until about 10 minutes after we finished our dessert and I had eaten slowly on purpose because I wanted to have coffee with dessert. THEN we proceeded to get the wrong check twice (with about ten minutes in between wrong checks) and wait about 35 minutes to get the correct check. There was some confusion between the waiter and waitress on who was supposed to take care of us, but it was a bit ridiculous. For 100$ for two people there are many places that have attentive service and tastier food. So for all of these reasons, I do not foresee us returning to this restaurant in the near future, unfortunately, because there really are some great aspects of this place

Full disclosure: After our last trip, which went awry (see the review), I got a phone call from the manager (owner?) apologizing for what went wrong, explaining that their chef had an emergency of sorts and needed to leave and someone else took over who did not do his job correctly. She said that she knew that this dinner was a total mess and that she wanted us to come back another night to try it again. I, of course, told her that was not necessary, but I appreciated the offer, but she insisted several times. That is how I found myself back there tonight.   Tonight's dinner was night and day different than the dinner we had two weeks ago. I know this may be slightly skewed since we had been asked back after having a not as good experience, but because of the nature of this restaurant (everyone gets the same food) I still think this experience was valid.   The patio continues to be beautiful, and tonight was a great night for the patio because it was cool, not cold, and the heaters were not necessary. The menu was a very good one, though not particularly suited to the husband and I (as we aren't generally fans of seafood and this menu was seafood heavy). Despite this, we enjoyed every bite of the meal.   We started with a lobster bisque. I was prepared not to like this, as I don't love lobster, but this was sooo good. Creamy, velvety, and not too fishy. It was served with a piece of toast that soaked up the broth...really good. Secondly, we had the same salad as the last time we were there....but it wasn't the same. It had the same components, but it was made correctly this time... last time it was just a piece of brie, with plain undressed arugula, plain nuts and a big piece of poached pear.... this time the salad was dressed perfectly, it had a thin slice of poached pear and a slice of poached apple and the brie was grilled (I think....)... it was so much better. For main dishes we had a filet topped with crab and a bearnaise sauce served with cheesy delicious potatoes, beets which were....beets, and nicely cooked asparagus and sea bass topped with cucumber and avocado served over red quinoa cooked with bacon, roasted carrots, and a delicious sauce (this was super flaky and delicious....the husband liked it better than the steak which is very unusual). Dessert was also tasty, it wasn't what it said it would be on the menu (was supposed to be chocolate espresso, but was a vanilla cake of sorts with several different yummy sauces like caramel and chocolate and served with fresh fruit...the best part? The nuts... really well toasted and added just the right amount of flavor). We weren't offered/didn't get coffee, but that was ok. Additionally, we had our dinner over 1.5 hours... I feel like that is an appropriate amount of time for a coursed dinner, so that was a great improvement. After this experience, I can see us giving this restaurant another chance... we will be back!   PS After giving it some thought, I have concluded that the problem that we have experienced at this restaurant is largely due to communication. Had we been told there were issues in the kitchen and invited back another night from the beginning, that would have been acceptable (especially given the size of this operation and I do feel that it was not very fair that because of yelp we got a second shot but the other people there that night who most likely had the same experience probably didn't get the same treatment). Had we been informed at some point about menu changes, that would be ok too, but for some reason, things like this aren't disclosed at this restaurant. For example, the menu said chocolate dessert or pureed potatoes or whatever, if I were at a regular restaurant and ordered that, they would need to tell me, Oh I'm sorry, we've run out of that, but we do have something else. Why isn't that the case here? If there was one thing I think they should change, that would be it. Just a thought, but, as described, the food was far better last night and the follow up service was also very good, so they have that going for them

I went here to 'do a project' with a friend (the project did not get done at all, but I digress) and he's from Taiwan so that was cool. We ordered so much food and it was so cheap! that was pretty awesome. We got the Taiwan noodles, which are rice noodles with some veggies like carrots and sprouts, and it was topped with some ground pork. It was pretty good, the noodles were a little hard to bite through, but the flavor was good. Then we got the pork chops, which were really good. They are breaded and fried and had a lot of flavor. We got the fried dumplings which were really good. They were crunchy on the bottom and soft on the top. It could have been more flavorful, but it was still good. Plus the potsticker sauce had little green onions in it, which is always good. We got green onion pancakes which were the best part! They were crispy, yet chewy, and had a great flavor.... so yum. Finally we got shaved ice with boba, red bean, grass jelly, and condensed milk. I've never had anything like that before, but it was pretty good. So overall, it was good and I would come back. The service wasn't too bad like others have said, but I could see how it might be if the place was busier.

This location is very good! The tacos al pastor are full of flavor, just like the other locations. I tried the cochata (coffee with horchata) the last time I went....Ridic! This stuff is so good! I would drink this on a daily basis. Props to whoever came up with that!

I cannot believe that anyone likes this place. Seriously, people wait in line for a LONG time here on the weekends....it blows my mind! I went here this morning with the BF and it was terrible! I got the veggie benedict with the hollandaise on the side (there's always too much sauce on these things...) and it just wasn't very good. The eggs were hard boiled....like chalky gross yolks...pretty not awesome. The tomatoes were mealy and the avocado was a bit brown. Additionally, there was a bit of mystery meat that somehow ended up on my plate...pretty unappetizing. The potatoes were pale, flavorless, and greasy...not worth eating. I ended up just eating the egg whites with the english muffin....real great breakfast for 10$. The BF got a blueberry pancake and bacon. The bacon was extremely fatty and the pancake was dry. I think the best part about this place is that it saved me a lot of calories....other than that, it was too expensive, loud, and all around not tasty. Definitely would not go back.

Whoa. Oh, and wow. So, I was debating giving this place four stars because yes it is dark in there and yes the tables are a bit cramped and it did get loud.... but..... I just can't. The food was so good that it completely made up for those things.   The BF and I went here for my (very very belated) birthday dinner (we had made res's somewhere else on my b day that fell through *cough* monarch *cough* and had to make new plans). So I decided to try something a bit different and go to the Mission. I am very glad I did. The BF and I made open table reservations and were seated promptly when we got there. Our waiter was this funny guy named Derek, who, at first I thought I wasn't going to like that much (I have an aversion to trendy scottsdale people) but turned out to be wonderful and make great suggestions all night! So thanks Derek!  The BF and I decided to order a few different small plates to get a feel for the restaurant. We ordered the cola crispy pork belly, the table side guac, the steak tacos, and a side of chipotle honey grits. I also got a Mission margarita. So my margarita comes out and it is really great! I have only had one other margarita that I liked equally. It was extremely fresh and it wasn't made out of that disgusting green sweet stuff that normally makes up margs. I would definitely recommend it (with salt).   We then get the chips and salsa. The salsa is really smokey and reminds me of the salsa at Abuelos, if you've ever tried that. I liked it a lot. So the man who makes the Guac came over and asked how spicy we wanted it, and we told him hot. He then proceeded to mix the guac using all fresh ingredients. It was so good! and so fresh! I liked how I could taste each flavor that went in, from the cilantro to the delicious tomato and jalapeno.... it was all good.... also, it had pinons on it, which gave it a cool texture. I have only had one better guac, and that is at Barrio cafe....   We get the rest of the food, and the portions look tiny, but in reality, they are huge because I just ate half an avocado and a bagillion or so chips. The cola pork belly was Ah. Maze. Ing. I have never had anything like it. It's a crispy sweet and spicy pork with peanut sauce in a lettuce cup. It's like thai mexican fusion. It was the best of the meal. The steak tacos were also wonderful. The BF said it was like eating a new york strip in a taco. It was a little sweet and a little savory... all good. The grits were the only part that were just ok. I liked them, they were creamy and different, but I wouldn't get them again.   So we had to get dessert, as it was my 'birthday' and Derek recommended the pumpkin bread pudding. Holy crap Derek, you are the man! This thing was one of the most delicious desserts I have had, and definitely the best bread pudding. It's pumpkin bread with a little bit of creme brulee, in a sea of wonderful butterscotch sauce (made from real scotch...mind=blown) with the perfect amount of ice cream and little crunchy seeds for texture. Whoa. Just whoa.   All this, and the bill was like 65$... that's wonderful! We could come and not get drinks and not get grits and it would be an affordable dinner, which is the best part, because I want to go back.... like right now.

Now this is the kind of bar I have been looking for in Phoenix! I went here last night with the BF and some friends and it was just the nicest little place, especially after spending the night before on mill... ugh. The decor reminds me of what your super hip friend's basement might look like. It has funky furniture and this light display that you can see when you are coming up the stairs that changes colors from the middle out (I stared at that thing extensively after a few drinks, and it was mighty entertaining). The place has strange movies and shorts being shown on the tvs. We watched a short about a kid cutting open a rabbit and an idol came out that demanded to eat jam.... pretty cool stuff. The place has comfortable couches and I liked that it wasn't too loud to have a conversation nor was it too busy for me to get a drink fairly quickly and without being bumped around.   Anyway, the bartender really knows what she is doing and the fact that so many of their ingredients for cocktails are made in house and fresh is a huge selling point for me. I tried four different specialty cocktails. First I had the pama mojito. This was by far the best drink of the night. The bartender uses fresh mint and fresh limes, beats them to a pulp, then adds in house made simple syrup and in house made sweet and sour and some pama liquor and it is wonderful. So easy to drink and refreshing. I don't even usually like mojitos that much, but this was great and I'm glad I gave it a try. I also tried my friend's drink which was the blueberry and jameson drink, with (of course) fresh blueberries. Also good, but I'm not a whiskey drinker generally. So then I had a sidebar collins, which is good and simple. Finally I had the butterscotch martini.... it is as good as it sounds. I will most definitely be back at this bar in the future, it is by far the best bar I have experienced in Arizona.   PS after a few drinks, check out the bathrooms... they have crazy iridescent tiles that looks super cool and there is a neat looking sink too.

I have done this hike a few times. I will say, it is not the most exciting hike ever BUT it is short and the views are ok and when you are done there are lots of places to eat :-P I would recommend A mountain for a hike if you are low on time. Ps the part of the trail that is all paved is really steep so don't let the height and length of this trail fool you....it's not as easy as it looks.

I am breaking my general yelping rule, and giving a place 5 stars on a first visit. But this place really earned it this weekend. The BF were debating coming here for restaurant week after having gone to a different restaurant the night before and being super disappointed. I'm really glad we decided to go. The view was nice, we sat right by the window by the fire pit, so we got to look out over the city and at the fire...it was pretty awesome. The rolls were delish....they were almost croissant -y. I ended up getting the restaurant week menu and the BF ended up getting a cheeseburger (he had wanted one all day). I started with a ginger marg at the waiter's recommendation...it was sooooo good. It was spicy with ginger...I kind of loved it. Also, it turned out that most of my food had a ginger note, so it paired really well with my meal.  The BF had a nice pinot grigio, which paired well with his burger :-P. For an app, I got the butternut squash soup, which was a little gingery and not as thick as butternut squash soup usually is, but very delicious. For my main, I had the sirloin cap...it was awesome! perfectly cooked, and served with a puree that had a delicious gingery and fresh herb flavor. I could eat that steak anytime...it was wonderful. The burger was also delicious...it was thick and juicy, also perfectly cooked, and had really fresh veg on top and a really tasty onion ring. For dessert, we had the warm chocolate cake and it was amazing...chocolate just oozed out of it. I liked that it wasn't too sweet, but had a rich chocolate flavor. I will definitely be back here, restaurant week or not!

uuuuuugh. What a sorry disappointment of a meal. The BF and I went here for dinner tonight and it was pretty not good. I got the pick two with the balsamic steak 'panini' and the chicken stew. The BF got a turkey 'panini.' Well....his 'panini' was barely toasted, let alone a panini. My sandwich was toasted but the steak was pretty gross....chewy and tasted like it came out of a bag. The tomatoes were mealy. The whole thing was sad. The chicken stew was decent, but had that plastic -y look to it. I always find that a little disturbing. It came with a biscuit that was really gross and didn't go with the stew at all. Both of our cookies were raw in the middle. Plus the meal cost 20$. Really?! 20$?!?! Are they kidding me? I could get a countless amount of better food for that money. Not awesome. Not even good. I won't be returning.

I went to Posh tonight for restaurant week with a friend and I must say....it was pretty awesome! Now, this may be pretty subjective since everyone gets different food and you don't order, so I can't speak about consistency, but tonight it was really good. My friend and I started with a couple cocktails...I had a raspberry marg that was delicious and had real muddled raspberry in it. Our meal started with an amuse bouche of avocado puree with radish on it....very acidic and tasty. My four course meal included a salad with fava beans, cucumber foam of sorts, ricotta, jicama, and other veg...very tasty, fluke fish crusted in something or another that made it delicious and not fishy at all over a white bean puree that made me want to lick the plate, then came the one item I didn't care for all that much which was escargot empanadas over tomato sauce with a garlic foam (I'd never had escargot before, so it's totally not the restaurant's fault, I was glad for the opportunity to try something new), and it finished with a vanilla crepe with strawberry jam and strawberry jelly....was delicious! My friend is vegetarian so he had some delish vegetarian fare including a popcorn soup (it really tasted like popcorn), an Asian taco on flat bread with baby bok choy and carrots and other stuff, a rice dish with haricot verts, and a cheesecake with berries and deliciousness. After all of that, they gave us these cold lemon lollipops with pepper in them that were also delicious and sent us home with cookies.....this place knows how to make you feel like you got good value in your experience for sure.I would definitely come back here...it was really a memorable night.

The BF and I went here yesterday for lunch (seriously... haha) and we liked the froyo. I like that they have little cups available to taste the flavors of froyo and I thought the toppings were adequate. They had these very good dark chocolate raspberry things that were wonderful. Additionally, their fruit was fresh and tasty. I would definitely get froyo here again if I were in tempe marketplace, but I don't know that I'd go out of the way to go here over other places like this.

So, I got to go here with a friend from out of town yesterday! We each got two different flavors of ice cream (a ridiculous amount of ice cream). I got the superstition farm (?) flavor, it was hazelnut and something and coffee in a cup and she got the same hazelnut one and peach in a cone. The ice cream was good, it was really soft and creamy and the flavors were strong. My only problem with it, is that it wasn't anything super special. Yes, it was much better than baskin robbins or coldstone, but I've had better, more creative ice cream.

I went to Scramble this weekend with the BF while waiting for my car to be fixed. You come in and order at the counter and then sit down. We went at about 10 am on a Saturday and it was busy, but there were tables available. I had the alma brizza. What an awesome idea! The crust was good, the brizza was flavorful, my only problem with it was that it was WAY too big. I ate half and was full. The BF got biscuits and gravy and said it tasted like pepperoni pizza...in a good way. The breakfast was not at all healthy, but if I were in the neighborhood, I would go back.

I went to the Tom Thumb trailhead last Sunday, but when we got there, we realized that hike was a double diamond and became intimidated. We ended up walking along a bunch of the smaller trails such as the rock knob trail (I think that was what it was called). The scenery was beautiful, all the flowers are blooming right now! We saw a bunch of wildlife, small animals, lizards, etc. The hiking wasn't strenuous, even for trails marked as moderately difficult (maybe we should have gone for the double diamond). The trails were fairly well maintained, but there was a lot of dog poop all over the trails....not so cool. Also, it was quite the drive to get out there. I would probably only go here once in awhile due to it being a loooong drive from my house, but the benefit to that is that there is more to see out here due to it being more a part of the desert.

The BF and I headed over to try this coffee place this morning as part of the (extreme) coffee tour of Phoenix!! (f.t.w.). This place is super cute. It is in an old house of sorts and is very homey on the inside. It also has a beautiful garden/ seating area outside that would be very nice to sit in (if it weren't so hot out, anyway). So we were greeted by the relatively friendly baristas inside and ordered. The BF got a latte (my usual) and since he got it, I decided to try the Toddy instead. His latte was very good, and it was at the perfect temperature, not too crazy hot, but not cool either. That was great. He asked for 2% milk and it still tasted like a more creamy milk, so kudos to that. The coffee flavor was also prominent, but not overpowering. My toddy was really good also. The coffee flavor is great, it's cool and refreshing (as much as a caffeinated drink can be anyway), and they offered to put a little cream in it, so that's a bonus. I will most definitely be back to this place. Yay Bergies!

Let me start by saying I have attended many of Sutra's events over the last couple years, of which there are many... lunar flow, which is a nice flow by the Clarendon pool at night under the moon.. beautiful, but the cement is a little hard on the knees... still, a nice offering.... the rooftop flow on Sunday mornings... very nice, great views, and a lovely way to spend the morning.... and some of their free flows. That being said, I actually went to their studio for the first time a couple weeks ago after trying to go there for months - here's the story:  I signed up for an inversion workshop, probably in April or May 2014 for June 2014. I was so excited, as I had just started to be able to *think* about inverting in my practice. Unfortunately, the instructor couldn't keep the date of the workshop and rescheduled for July, a date when I would be out of town. Bummer! I called and explained the situation... they offered me a refund if I would like or offered to keep the payment and apply it to the workshop the next time they offered it. I decided to apply it to the next workshop to hold myself accountable to attend. They told me they would sign me up for the next date when it came available, but to call ahead of time to be sure it was done. Anyway, time went on, I began practicing more regularly and attended a different inversion workshop at my regular studio. Despite this, I was still excited for this workshop, because there is always something new to learn. I called a couple weeks ahead of time to make sure I was enrolled, and was told my credit had expired. What?!?! I explained that I was told I could apply the credit to this workshop which hadn't been offered between the time I had paid and now... the girl on the phone offered to look into it for me and tell the owner.   *side note* Now, I have a little bit of an issue with this... why would money I paid to a studio expire... ever? They got the money.... I got nothing... my mere presence in their workshop or class doesn't cost them anything, as they're going to teach the class regardless, I just don't really understand this policy.   Anyway, it took over a week (and my calling back a few times) before I got a call from someone assuring me that they reinstated the credit and signed me up for the workshop, so I was happy with that.   The studio is very nice, they have a semi private area to keep your things behind the front desk, it feels fairly secure. The studio is cute, with hard floors and mirrors at the front and side. It isn't a huge studio, but it was nice. The workshop with Angie Hall was AMAZING! I was more than pleased with it. There wasn't a second wasted, we learned all kinds of inversions and tricks to help build the muscles necessary to do these inversions. Angie was awesome, she remembered all of our names and gave us individualized feedback throughout the session to help us know if we were on the right track or if we needed to adjust something. I felt like the workshop was more than worth the 20$ (and the trouble of signing up for it... ha!). I have been practicing what she taught me and hope to be flying (successfully) very soon.... Thank you Angie! I would recommend you and your classes to anyone!

So the BF and I went here tonight with the BF's mom and dad for his mom's birthday. She's a vegetarian and had heard good things about this place, but the rest of us are not vegetarians. So first off, this place has a very cult ish feel. The workers all seem like they're in a daze and they play a video talking about the 'grand master.' Whoa.   Anyway, so you go up to the counter to order. I got the spicy cha cha due to the overwhelming popularity of this dish on yelp, BF accidently ordered the family bean curd (he meant to order sweet and sour but gave the wrong number, his mom go the S&S, and his dad got the burger. They gave us a weird cup of soup before we got our meal. It had the consistency of egg drop.... it was pretty low on flavor, but was the best thing I had there.   First off, when we looked at the menu it said a side of rice cost 1$, but we were charged 2$ for each side of rice... wtf. Second, my food was terrible. Maybe I overlooked it, but on the menu it says that this dish is yam protein. I thought, I like yams... this was not anything like a yam. It was fake shrimp! WTF, why doesn't the menu say imitation shrimp? I hate shrimp! maybe it was my fault... but seriously, wtf. The meat had the consistency of shrimp (gross) and a weird flavor that still lingers in my mouth hours later. It was dry and had no sauce, plus it wasn't spicy. It's called spicy cha cha..... I ate a couple of the fake shrimps but that was all I could eat. The BF's was also pretty bad. It was mushy and flavorless. Supposedly the sweet and sour was good, but I didn't try it.   So his mom liked the food and that was the point of going here, but that does not mean that I have to give it a good rating. I would not go here again.... or at least until the next time BF's mom wants to go... but I'd definitely get something different.

Ok... 4 stars, but really 4.5 stars. I went here for lunch today with my Dad and it was pretty fabulous. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile as it gets favorable yelp reviews, and after my Dad and I went through every type of food out there (want sandwiches? no. Thai? no. Chinese? no. and on and on) I suggested this place. I'm glad I did. So we got there around 1 pm and we had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table. Once we were seated, it took quite awhile for anyone to come help us. So that's kind of where the points were taken off. That and there were no chips to go with their fabulous salsa unless you get guac (which we ended up getting). So initially we ordered the elote (corn on the cob covered in cheese and paprika.....much better than I though it would be.... although I have no reason to think it wouldn't be good.... hmmm), two pork tacos, and a carne asada torta. The tacos were good, but I hate to say, if I wanted to get a taco just like that I may go to America's Tacos, just for convenience because they are priced similarly and sized similarly. The torta, however, was very delicious. The meat was tasty, the roasted tomato tasted very nice, and if you put the tomatillo salsa on it.... wow it's delicious. Plus the bread was nice and soft, but not soggy. So we also ended up getting guac (just a side dish of it, so 3$ instead of 7$) at the extreme recommendation of our server, and it was good, but not the best guac I've ever had. I wish it were spicy... that would improve it a great deal. Overall, the food was excellent and well priced. For everything, we payed 22$. Not bad.

Well..... I don't love this bar. I went with a friend last weekend to get some drinks and the place was busy. We couldn't sit at the bar, so we got a table. The place is loud, and got progressively louder as the night went on, solely because someone kept turning the country music up louder and louder, it did not seem like there were significantly more people in the place. Country music is not my thing, but I can't judge on that because I knew what I was getting into in that department. We both started with long islands, which my friend really liked because it was more lemonade -y, but I didn't like so much because I like the long islands that have more of an ice tea ish flavor... less lemon. It was fine, and it also got me tipsy, so I can't complain that much I guess. Then she ordered some blue drink off of their signature cocktails and I got a margarita. The blue was soooooooo nasty.   I mean, this thing was bad.   I don't know who made up the recipe, but it was unlike anything I have ever tasted.... and not in a good way. My margarita was a typical low end margarita, it had sweet and sour mix and cheap tequila. It was not good, but it was what it was. When we got the bill, I was a little shocked that each drink cost 8$.... for real? That is super high for bars in phoenix... especially for ones in Mesa. Cactus moon next door practically gives away their drinks.... and it's basically the same bar. Oh well, now I know for next time.   Oh, PS We had to pay a 5$ cover charge to go to this place (Really?!?!) because they were 'having a band.' Well, we got there at 8:30 and left around 10 and there was no band to be seen. That was a little frustrating.   PPS if you want to see some of the sparkly -est, most short shorts you have ever seen, this is the bar for you.

We went on the Real London Bus pub crawl in downtown Phoenix this past Saturday for my friend's bachelorette and it was awesome!!! I got a Groupon for the bus, so it was only 25$. We went to 4 bars including Rose and Crown, The Duce (awesome!), Turf, and Copper Blues. The bus itself was really fun, they played music, they had beer, they took the long way (so you could finish your beer...how thoughtful of them!). My only complaints are that the bars didn't really give us discounts as promised with our bus tour wrist bands and the tour didn't make it clear what the discounts would be, so I thought that took some of the value away from the crawl. Overall, it was a great time and provided a safe and fun way to get from bar to bar. I probably would not pay the 50$ price tag, but would definitely go again with a Groupon.

So the BF was going to take me out to celebrate my new job (yay!), but forgot one tiny detail....where we were going..... nice. So now it's 7 o clock on a Friday night and we have no reservations and everywhere we call has at least an hour wait....So I take over this situation and used Yelp power to find this place, which was lucky because they had open reservations and were very good.   The people who work here really know what they are doing. They are both friendly and professional. Our waiter Vinnie was great, he made very good suggestions when asked for them and was attentive. Additionally, their prices are extremely reasonable for the type of food offered and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere...very romantic (despite being in a casino). They make all of their pasta in house which is great, but it's kind of weird because they have a lady locked in a little red box with full length windows so you can watch her make pasta. I don't know how happy that would make me....but it is cool to see. Anyway, off of my tangent, we started with soup and salad (it comes with the meal) and they were good. I had the minestrone and, at first, I didn't like it because it was a bit thin, but after a few bites it was really good! The BF had the caesar salad with dressing on the side (he can't eat caesar dressing, but I can!) and it too was tasty. For mains, I had the filet (at Vinnie's recommendation) and it was really good. It is a filet on top of a 'risotto cake' aka fried cheesy goodness with spinach, mushrooms, and a balsamic glaze on it. I ordered the filet medium well because I am a crazy person about rare meat, but this kitchen sure knows how to cook a steak. It almost fell apart...so tender, not chewy at all, and had a lot of flavor. The BF got the porterhouse and it was good (but mine was better). I don't think he would order it again, only because other things on the menu are better, although It did come with the most buttery and tasty fingerling potatoes... really tasty. Again at Vinnie's recommendation (I'm glad he put up with me....), we got the ricotta cheesecake for dessert along with coffee. It was 4$ (for real?!?!) and it was soooo goood. It was creamy and sweet without being overly sweet. It had chocolate and caramel on it with raspberry (?) sauce underneath, fresh berries on the side, and a perfect quenelle (I totally had to look up that spelling... teehee) of whipped cream....and not just like redi-whip or something, but a thick, home made (tasting at least) whipped cream.    Ready for the most surprising part? All of this food was 58$! That is crazy for the amount of steak we had. I would definitely come back here (maybe next time I'll try the lamb...mmmm).

The BF and I went here this morning after thinking about trying this place for awhile. Let me start by saying that in order to look at their menu online you need to download adobe reader and even then, no prices are listed. That was my first semi complaint, but I figured it would be good, so I shouldn't worry too much about that. So we got there at around noon and the place is cute, big patio and all. We were seated and got water from the very nice bus boy who works there. Our waiter came by and we both ordered coffee, I got the fire island eggs and the BF got the biscuits and gravy. When we got our coffee we were assured that the food would be out shortly. Well...I don't know what shortly means to them, but we waited a good 20 minutes or so for our food. Not so awesome. The BF's coffee was empty for about 10 minutes of this time with no offer to refill and no one around to ask. We get our food and mine was alright...it's chicken in a cream cheese semi spicy sauce on 'pizza' bread (kind of thick...not really crusty, but whatever). The flavor was just very one dimensional and the dish got boring after the first few bites....it was kind of too rich, which isn't something I would generally say. The BF's biscuits and gravy were not good. He said they tasted like a pizza hut meat lover's pizza. The biscuits were not light or flaky and the gravy was just one note...spicy. Plus, the gravy tasted the same as the potatoes that came with it (kind of like peppers)....so it was a big plate of one flavor, and not even a very good flavor. Additionally, and not necessarily the restaurant's fault, there were tons of flies around....they kept landing on our cups and it was somewhat annoying...maybe the trash needs to be taken out more often? Or maybe it's because people had their dogs at this restaurant, which I think is somewhat gross...I don't know, just not so pleasant. So the waiter comes by and takes the plates away and then we sit and wait...and wait...and wait for our check. I don't really understand this because I would think that he would have wanted the check as soon as possible, but maybe he knew he did a poor job and had given up on our table. Either way, after ten more minutes or so we got the check and paid cash to avoid the inevitable long wait if paying with a credit card. The total was 27$...that's pretty pricey considering the quality of this meal...feels like a waste of money to me. So if you like having all of your food taste like peppers and that's it and over paying for that experience....this is the place for you, otherwise, I'd say skip this place.

I went here yesterday for lunch with my Dad. The place was hopping!! There was a 20-40 minute wait, but, luckily, we found two seats at the bar. The restaurant is cute and the bar was a nice area. We ordered the steak panzanella (sp?) salad and the pepperoni pizza. Both were very good! I liked the steak in the salad, it was cooked to around medium I'd say and sliced thin, it was very tender and tasty. The dressing was great and the salad was fresh. The pizza was also very good, although a bit greasy. The pepperonis were the size of small saucers... which was awesome! They were perfectly spiced. The whole pizza had a lot of flavor, and I liked how the pepperoni came with basil on it. The sauce was also flavorful and delicious. I thought the place was fairly expensive, but I would definitely come back here again. And I have leftovers to eat today... woot!!!

I have been back to The Parlor a few times since my last review, and, I must say, it is pretty flippin fantastic. I LOVE the make your own pizza sheets and I LOVE that you get basil and other fresh herbs at no charge...that is how it should be. The perfect pizza (for me) is basil, garlic, bacon, goat cheese, roasted veg, and arugula. Ohhhh yesss! So wonderful. Just thinking about it right now makes me want to go there immediately. The best part is you can make a small pizza just for yourself and don't have to share with anyone AND it is big enough to have leftovers the next day.... love the leftovers. I think of all the pizza places in Phoenix right now, this may be my absolute favorite....I mean....this place is terrible.....please don't go here so I don't have to wait in line :-D

After wanting to try this place on my last couple visits to Vegas, I finally made it there on Monday. The husband and I literally drove from Phoenix straight to Mount Everest for the lunch buffet. This buffet was no joke, the food on it was very good. We both felt it was one of the best Indian buffets we had been to. So much so, that I ate a ton of food and couldn't eat another thing for the rest of the day. Standout dishes were the chickpea curry, the sweet rice (never seen this before!), and the warm carrot dessert.... so tasty! The chicken tikka masala wasn't the best I'd ever had. Complaints include: we finished a full plate of food before getting the opportunity to ask for naan (they didn't bring any to us), our booth was in a weird corner you had to squeeze into, and their women's bathroom wasn't super clean (although I imagine that was from a recent customer and not due to a general lack of cleanliness). I would recommend this place to locals for sure.

This place is no longer in business... It's now Villa Peru I believe. I went searching for this place to go eat breakfast, only to find that other place (and it wasn't open... *tear*).

As bad as DOCG was is as good as Scarpetta was. I learned my lesson....don't be cheap. It is worth the extra money to eat here for sure. I went here with a friend as our first meal on her first trip to Vegas. When you enter, the restaurant looks tiny... like a long hallway, and then when you get to the end it opens into a large restaurant with a big window overlooking the Bellagio fountains .... so cool. I was worried that I would need to order a lot to get full and spend a ton of money.... not the case. We both ended up ordering the short rib and bone marrow agnolotti and not only was it delicious but it was super filling. It was savory, had varying texture, and spiced perfectly... I loved every bite. That, in addition to their amazing bread basket (including 4 types of bread with some stuffed with cheese/meat/veg and 3 dips a whipped soft cheese spread, citrus olive oil, and eggplant), filled us up...awesome! We finished with the waiter recommended doughnut dessert.... I had one complaint about that dessert, either I missed it or they didn't tell us that one side of the plate was all nutella filled donuts and the other side was all vanilla... I thought the vanilla and nutella would be mixed...so when I was eating from one side and my friend was eating from the other side we were both confused where the other flavor was.... Anyway, the nutella donut with the banana gelato was awesome, the vanilla...not so much. That was a pretty minor problem. Our service was great and we each paid about 30$...not bad at all. Will be back for sure.

This place was mucho yum..... I went here last week and thought it was going to be not so good, as there were a whole bunch of cops outside and only high school kids running it. I was so wrong! The people that worked there were very friendly and let me try different flavors without seeming annoyed or anything. I ended up getting super dark chocolate (or something to that effect) and coffee. The coffee is like real coffee... not sweet, but tasty. The super dark is also not very sweet, it has a bitter chocolate flavor.... I really enjoyed that, as you don't get those kinds of flavors in gelato or ice cream too often. The BF got peanut m&m flavor and really enjoyed it. He said it had the overall flavor of a peanut m&m, it wasn't just gelato with peanut m&ms in it. Overall, it was really good and I would definitely come back.

I went here with a friend on Monday to get manis and pedis. We both got a Travelzoo deal for the mani and pedi for 20$...a total steal. We both were taken care of by Jennifer, who was very sweet. The salon itself was nice, it had some bright colors and looked clean overall; however, when we first came into the salon we had to wait about 10 minutes to be helped at the receptionist's desk...not the best first impression. Anyway, we both went back with Jennifer and my friend had her mani and pedi first. I thought this was a little weird, as I would think she would do both manis then both pedis so one of us wasn't sitting around for 45 min or so and then the other sitting around for the same time. Anyway, I took a look at her color selection and it was decent. My only real complaint on this front was that she had some pretty low end polishes for a nice salon (e.g. wet and wild.....not really acceptable for a salon IMHO). While I waited, Jennifer offered me some wine....definitely gets a star for that....what an awesome thing to offer! When it was my turn to get a mani, she did a good job. It is a couple days later and my nails still look good. The pedi was also nice and included some kind of sugar scrub which was very nice. The few things I have to complain about include: the salon only has 4 nail technicians, so if you want to go with your friends, it isn't the MOST convenient place to go and the fact that they had Wet and Wild nail polish was pretty cheesy. I would consider going back, though, and Jennifer's normal prices are pretty good (30$ for spa pedi, 20$ hot oil mani).

Wow. This is the pho I have been searching for in Phoenix. Dare I say it puts the pho in Phoenix *teehee.* I have been looking for good pho since I moved here from Seattle (land of pho every 20 feet) and never found a place that measured up. Generally, the broth was bland and the dish was americanized and way overpriced. Well, look no further, this is the real deal. From the minute you walk in, you can tell this place is more authentic than most. They have communal tables with grab-your-own chopsticks, spoons, condiments, etc. There is no fancy decor. Who needs it when the food is so good? The pho comes out in a large bowl and the price is right (like 6$). I had the Pho filet and the broth was flavorful,  the meat was tender, and the noodles were abundant. I also had a legit Thai Tea. I came here with an unexpected group of 7 people (I think... Amanda B and her daughter, Irene V, Amy H, Jon H, Rachelle H, and some others) and the restaurant accommodated (despite being very busy and mostly thanks to Irene V). I will certainly be back here in the near future!

Joel is amazing. I love how real he is. No BS. He does a good job, fixes your car right and at an affordable price. I've used Joel several times when I had my older car and needed a lot of repairs and the husband has brought his car here as well. If you need any work done, take it to Joel... he's amazing!

I went here last night because I had gotten a Voice daily deal....I was a little wary to buy it at first due to some of the mixed reviews (at the time), but I had wanted to try it for awhile and decided to go for it.   Well, I am very glad I did!  The BF and I decided to share two entrees, the cocomo (?) chicken and the jerk pork plate. The chicken was good, it had a coconut crust that was a bit crispy and had a sweet sauce on it. It came with some delicious fried plantains and rice and beans that weren't my thing, but the BF loved it! As good as the chicken was, the jerk pork is where it's at! The pork was spicy, savory, and abundant. The dish came with johnny cakes that went perfectly with the pork... they are like slightly sweeter and richer corn bread. Ridiculously tasty. It also came with the same plantains, but the rice had a delicious salsa on it that was sweet and spicy...the BF didn't like the salsa, but I loved it! (worked out perfectly, huh?). Needless to say, I can't wait to come back and try this place again.    PS A table by us got the coconut banana pie and I was just about drooling....it looked so good, that's on the must try list for next time.

Update! I have been back to Hula's many times since the first time and it is still (fairly) consistently good. I love Hula's patio and fire pit...it is so nice on a cool day to sit by the fire while enjoying some beverages. Speaking of beverages, Hula's has a fantastic happy hour ('Tiki Time'). Drinks are about 5$ and it goes until 7 pm, even on Saturdays. This is craziness! The BF and I went there a few weeks ago and drank many many beverages (He likes the Dr. Funk and I am in love with the Lilikoi margarita (it is very tasty, trust me)) and the bill was still very reasonable. The food is somewhat hit and miss (hence the 4 star review), they have delicious jerk pulled pork that is always good, but other items were a miss such as the potstickers (tasted like Ling Ling's), the macadamia crusted fish (was pretty bland), and the chicken tacos (too big and not flavorful enough). I would probably stick to the pork. I STILL haven't had their coconut banana pie, but it always looks good....I might go there tonight and get it :-D.

I didn't realize there was a Pita Jungle in Fashion Square... I was so happy when I saw it! The BF and I really just wanted a snack, so we to the garlic dip. The girl behind the counter was miserable and looked really mad that she was working. So not such good service, but the garlic dip, like usual, was delicious! I think they should probably give you at least 2 pitas with the dip.... but whatever. Also, the pita at this location didn't taste the same as what I remembered having at the sit down location.

What a neat little shop! I have passed by the Tempe Farmers Market several times and always wondered what was inside. Clearly it wasn't what one normally thinks of when thinking of a farmer's market (temporary space with a bunch of vendors....). I finally made it in and was surprised by the variety of items that were offered. The TFM has local fruits and veg as well as many awesome local food products for fairly reasonable prices. They have everything from yogurt to frozen tamales to fresh tortillas.... I ended up buying a half loaf of bread for 2$ (which is an awesome idea BTW... sometimes you don't need a whole loaf), a jar of tahini (priced cheaper than at the grocery), and some locally roasted coffee (cortez). Anyway, I would definitely stop in here again if I were in the neighborhood!

This place kind of rocks a whole lot. They give you as much free delicious and warm bread as you want with balsamic. My brother had them cater his wedding and the food was quite good. I went there last night for my mom's birthday and the food was equally good. I got the pasta rustico and it was tasty, but would benefit from some basil or something. The BF had the turkey sandwich and it tasted very fresh which was good. My mom had the chicken in creamy garlic sauce with pesto added and it was delicious! So rich, but so tasty. Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was great. I'll definitely be back here again.

I went here tonight with the BF as a do over for last night's ice cream fiasco (in which we didn't end up eating a lot of ice cream). This place is very cute and Italian owned, which is always a plus. The BF and I shared a cup with strawberry and chocolate. The chocolate was good, with chunks of chocolate in it, I wasn't a huge fan of the strawberry. My main critique of this place is there was no coffee or espresso flavored gelato.... that is something I would have wanted. They do have coffee, however, so I got a latte and it was good. It had a strong coffee flavor... it wasn't my favorite coffee in the valley, but it is very nice to have with gelato. I would probably come back here if I were in the neighborhood.

I received a flyer from this business on my door a few days ago and was feeling lazy so I ordered delivery. The person on the phone was rude, just like Cory said. Also, the pizza took an hour to get here (just a few blocks away) and was completely flavorless. I would not order from here again.

So I had bought a Living Social deal for a month of unlimited classes here, and decided to challenge myself to a month of going and working out 6 days a week this past December (I know, late review). This location was really great. I really loved the Zumba here, they used good music and it was nothing like the Zumba I had taken when I lived in Seattle, nor was it like the Zumba at ASU. It is much better. I liked the morning classes with Theresa and the Tuesday and Thursday night Zumba (man, what was the teacher's name... I don't think he's there anymore cuz he's not on the schedule but he was great, Jaime, the guy who teaches it now, is also really good. I also really like the cardio dance class which is cool because it is very different depending on the instructor, for example, if Ross was teaching it, it was more ballet oriented, but if Theresa was teaching it, it had more latin influence. I wasn't a huge fan of bella barre (but maybe that's just because I'm too out of shape to handle it) and I also don't like that they don't really offer midday classes (So I'm a graduate student and all of my classes are at night and clinic is in the morning, so midday would be ideal for me, even though that is not often the case for most people, and I understand that). Finally, I felt that this location was a lot better than the Scottsdale location. It felt more homey and more friendly and the regulars felt like they were more down to earth type people. I always preferred this location. I am just sad that I can't afford to go to this place all the time, as it gets to be quite pricey, but if they had another deal, I would definitely buy it.

This place is really good! I have been there twice and have enjoyed the food both times. The first time I got a cheeseburger... it was greasy, but in the best possible way. Tonight I got a hot dog. It was good, not the best I have ever had, but good. The relish was tasty and had that good green color like chicago relish. The hotdog was much better than the ones I've had at another hot dog place down the street....no names, but man that place was bad. The people who work there are always friendly and the food comes out quickly.   Overall this is a good place, I recommend it for anyone wanting a burger or hotdog in tempe.

The BF and I went here tonight with the International Supper Club and it was really good! I have only had Korean food a few times before and this was by far the best I've had (the other places were in Seattle, so that's pretty good). The lady who worked there was helpful, a little stressed out, but helpful. She managed to get everyone's food out at around the same time and it was all steaming hot...literally steaming. I had the spicy soup with sliced beef and it was really good. I thought it could be a little spicier, but it had a lot of flavor and the beef fell apart. The BF had the bulgogi and it was amazing! Very soft and flavorful. The sides were all interesting...we got 4 sets of 7-8 side dishes to share. The tofu side was the best, and I don't particularly like tofu, but this was firm, spicy, and delicious. The bok choy, spicy potato, cucumbery thing, and kim chi were all very good. Now, this place is not particularly cheap, but we had so much food, it was crazy! Plus, it all tasted good. I would definitely come back here in the future!

I can't comment on the food here, as I did not have any. I got a Groupon for Jello shots from Pinks. Oh. Em. Gee. These were the most disgusting things I have ever put in my mouth. They tasted like cough syrup, but worse. I would not recommend this to anyone...not even sure if they were made of real food substances. Eeeeeek.

I bought a groupon for this place because I figured I could just get some drinks with it. We got there and told the hostess we just wanted to drink so she pointed us in the direction of the outside bar...well there were no seats in the bar, so we wandered around and eventually sat ourselves at the inside bar. The BF and I got a couple of their 'signature' margaritas. They were pretty terrible. I had the prickly pear margarita and it was very strong and tasted fairly terrible. Also, they put some super spicy stuff around the rim of the cup that was really unpleasant and was not mentioned on the menu. The drinks were 12$. This was ridiculous. I would not come back here again.

So I went here yesterday as part of my coffee tour of Phoenix! I really want to give it 5 stars because it is cute, they have really nice looking pastries (that I didn't try.... but I will, oh yes, I will) and the iced latte I got was wonderful! I just can't give it five stars without trying a hot latte because I think the hot latte shows real skill with the foaming of the milk and all, where an iced latte is just the espresso with milk poured in. I will definitely be back to try the hot latte in the near near future and to update this review. The espresso they pulled was very smooth and flavorful.... so good. I would definitely recommend this place.

I went here again last weekend as an updated part of the coffee tour of Phoenix! The BF came this time around and he got a hot latte and I got an iced. The hot latte was just wonderful! It is one of my favorites in the city. The espresso was strong without being acidic and the milk was frothed perfectly. It really was a pleasure. My iced latte was also just as good as it was last time.... so two points for consistency. We also split this super cute banana macaroon type dessert... it was banana cake with a chocolate mousse type filling and chocolate jimmies on the outside.... it was Sooooooooo good! It tasted like two cupcake tops with the frosting between them. The cake was soft and extremely fresh and the whole thing was great. So Hooray to Royal at the market for being super awesome in many ways!

CLOSED?!?!?! Maaaaaan. I pretty much moved downtown JUST to get coffee here....well....maybe that's not true.....but seriously? I am sooo sad this place closed because it is some fine coffee and pastries. I have dreams about their chocolate cupcakes. I went the other day with a friend and they were unusually closed, but no sign....then returned a few days later to see their door covered in paper. Their sign says they are looking to relocate somewhere else in downtown sometime this winter, which I hope is true. Hey Royal! You can open in the open space under the Alta lofts or in the Arizona center if you wanna....just sayin....

Special thanks to Irene V whose review sent me in this place's direction. Top Design Nails was a real good find. They do not take appointments, but when I went in, despite being pretty full, they fit me in right away. I got a mani/pedi and eyebrow wax.... for 34$....wow, that is almost unheard of.... last time I got my eyebrows waxed it cost 20$ just for that! The girl who did my mani pedi was really sweet and very meticulous. It was the younger girl who is really cute (bad description, I know). Anyway, she did a great job. The woman who did my brows said she does 50+ brows per day... and you can tell, she did a great job and did it so fast. I would bring cash as there is a 2$ fee to use cards. I will be back!

SO I went by this place with my dad after lunch today on my coffee tour of Phoenix!!! (ftw). This place is walking distance from my dad's office, so it was perfect as far as location goes. The inside is really nice, I like the decor and I think it feels comfortable. I got a latte and my dad got an iced mocha with whipped cream. Well they make their own whipped cream and it was really good! It has a little bit of chocolate and coffee in it. Yum. My latte was good, but was more milky than coffee -y. The espresso was a little weak. Overall, it was a really good cup of coffee though, and it ranks up there with the good coffee shops of phoenix. I would definitely go back. Also, they have the cutest pastries! they have little tarts and mini cupcakes and it all looks really good, but I didn't try one today because I had just eaten lunch. The prices were fair I thought. Overall, good place.

After sleeping one night in the Phoenix airport after a cancelled flight and then spending the entire day in the Charlotte airport having flight after flight cancelled due to hurricane Arthur while trying to get to Europe for our honeymoon, we decided we had to just get a hotel room. Us Airways (boooo), gave us a voucher to get a 'discounted' room for the night due to the cancelled flights. Well, the room wasn't really discounted, come to find out that the regular price is 100$ a night, same as we paid, but regardless, it was worth every penny. The room was amazing, large with a separate sitting space. A shuttle picked us up and dropped us off at the airport. Upon checking in, we had mentioned that we were trying to get to Europe for our honeymoon and they comped us a bottle of wine... how awesome and thoughtful was that? Their breakfast buffet was good and had a lot of options. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone staying in this area.    PS - they have a pool but... hurricane and all.... PPS - they have 24 hour room service and all kinds of things to borrow if needed (including toiletries and yoga mats.. what?!?!).. I didn't use these things, but it's nice that it's available.

Ohhhhh Lisa's rum cake is sooooo gooood. I used to eat Cathy's rum cake when I used to live in phoenix, in fact, I think the cake at my dad's wedding was a Cathy's rum cake. So I was sad when I saw the Cathy's empty! Come to find out, Cathy's daughter Lisa opened in another location! So the BF got me a little tiny cake for my birthday because I had been craving one for all 4 years we lived out of state. It was chocolate raspberry, and it was delicious! It was also beautiful, it had edible glitter and was just really yummy. I will continue to come here for all of my cake needs :-)

I have been wanting to buy a pair of five fingers for a year or more, but never did because A) they were expensive and B) I couldn't find ones that I loved. I finally decided I would buy a pair with some of my christmas/hanuka money, but I didn't really want to go to REI because the last time I went there to look at these shoes the sales people were very anti five fingers and did not seem to know much about them. Well, lucky for me, I was looking at vibram's website today and decided to see who sold these shoes in Arizona other than REI. On the first page of results Fitness Road showed up and I looked at their website. To my surprise, they were selling five fingers for 60$ while everyone else was selling them for 85. Further, they had a banner up that said they were having a year end clearance and to check facebook for details....40% off original prices! Are you kidding me?!?! I went down there right away.   The man who worked there was a bit quirky but he clearly loves these shoes and stands behind the product. The place is like a personal training/weight loss/shoe store...interesting. Someone was being trained in the back and it sounded like they were really making her work...so if you're interested in that, maybe look into this place. They had a HUGE selection of five fingers. I got the exact ones I wanted for about 50$ (instead of 85) and I was able to support a local business. Furthermore, he gave me referral cards to give to other people who are interested so they get 5$ off of their first purchase and if I refer 5 people I get a 20$ gift card. For real. This place rocks so hard! I also found out that this store was the first store to sell five fingers in AZ. Pretty neat. Anyway, I wouldn't go anywhere else to buy these shoes and if you are interested in them, I highly recommend this place for your funky shoe needs.

I can't believe I lived right near this Pita Jungle for so long and never went. This location is large, much larger than it looks from the outside. The decor is modern. The food is the same delicious pita jungle food that you can get at other locations including that ridiculously yummy jalapeno cilantro hummus. The one thing that was better at this location than others was the service. Usually, the workers of pita jungle are not the friendliest of people, but not so at this location! Definitely a plus. I will be back!

Ugh... every once in awhile I think, oh Little Caesars is cheap and alright... let's pick some up.   This is a problem  The pizza is terrible... I know it's 5$... but still. It's just not good. I also always seem to remember liking the crazy bread, and then I get it and it's also just not good. I should have just stayed home and eaten cereal.  *sigh

The Bf and I got some take out from this place a few days ago..... not so awesome. We got a double crust (or something to that effect) cheese pizza, a house salad, and garlic bread. The salad seemed old... the lettuce was all brown and wilted and the vegetables in the salad were not very fresh either. I couldn't even eat it. The garlic bread just tasted like buttered bread and the sauce was a bit strange and sweet. The pizza was too chewy and the cheese was thick. The sauce was good, but that was about the only good part of the experience. I wouldn't waste my money here again.... I'd prefer streets of new york for pizza in this area....or just driving to somewhere that's not west mesa for pizza, which is definitely your best bet.

I went to this chilis last night with an old friend for dinner... but I accidentally kind of ate dinner at Liberty Market before I went (oops....curse their delicious yet filling coffee and desserts!). So my friend and I just shared some chips and salsa and a chicken jalapeno quesadilla. So our waiter was on his first day and made some mistakes.... brought out the wrong type of quesadillas and didn't fill the water when he should of, but I don't fault him and he apologized profusely (too much... ha). The quesadillas just weren't good though. I go to the chili's by ASU a lot, and the food is generally fine, it is what it is, but it's convenient and good. The food last night was not good. The chicken tasted weird and half of the pieces were crispy and the other half were soggy....So a meh for this place.... I'd probably give it another shot if someone wanted to go here, maybe it was just an off night.

This studio is probably the best hot yoga studio I have been to. I went there several times a week for about a month over the summer and enjoyed it every time. I love the music they play and I love that the teachers are knowledgeable and motivational. I really got a great workout while going. The space is clean and even smells good....that's pretty awesome for a hot yoga studio. I like that they have wood floors...it makes me feel like they can keep it cleaner and it's easier to balance on. The reason why I knocked it to 4 stars is because it is simply unaffordable. I have a fairly good job, but I don't think I could afford to keep going. If this place was reasonably priced, it would definitely get 5 stars from me.

This is my regular NYPD location since it is closest to my house and delivers here. The food is what I generally expect from NYPD, it's good pizza. I love that they offer the Vinny's favorite (any 5 ingredients). We went with some friends last weekend, and NYPD just started offering personal sized pizzas....perfect size and perfect price! I got my Vinny's for 8$ and got two meals out of it. Excellent! I think it's a bit ridiculous to complain about a restaurant because they don't allow guns.....come on people, do you really need your gun when you're going to get some pizza? Personally, that makes me feel better (but that's just me).

I have to say, the Cosmo is probably my favorite casino to just hang out in. They have amazing decor that just makes me feel happy and they always have a good band playing at the Chandelier bar. The gaming here is so so, I don't usually win, but their drinks are fantastic and taste fresher than the drinks at other casinos (read: non neon green sweet and sour syrup) and the drinks are full size which is awesome. The restaurants here are alright, the pizza is good and the buffet is good. I like to go here and just wander around enjoying all of the art and the cool decor. This place is a must visit while in Vegas, and, though I haven't stayed here because it's very pricey, it's in a great location that would be nice to stay in.

After being on my bucket list for awhile, I finally made it out to El Chorro for happy hour yesterday. This place has a legit happy hour! Everything on the HH menu is 3$.... that is crazy! We had decent margaritas that were on the strong side (3$), split the sliders (3 sliders and fries for 3$... and the meat was good, juicy and seasoned with onions... really yummy stuff), and the sticky buns (pretty standard sticky buns). The food was tasty and inexpensive... the portions were large. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place for HH and I know I'll be back!  PS The restaurant itself is beautiful and the view of the mountains is nice.  PPS The bartender was friendly and our wait time for drinks and food was incredibly short.

I have been to this place twice and have enjoyed it both times. Yes, it is just the typical yogurt shop that have popped up all over the place, but it is close to my house and it is tasty. The first time I went here I got coconut yogurt with chocolate chips and fruit and it was very tasty. The second time I got pumpkin and tart yogurts with chocolate and fruit again and it was also super good. For the second time I had a living social and they gave me a gift card for the remaining balance, so needless to say, I will be back!

Of all the 'hot' yoga places I have been to in Phoenix, Sumits is my favorite by far. I understand that this is not 'traditional' yoga, but that is what I like about it. The class consists of a beginning series of standing poses, sun salutation type flow, and balancing postures, then moves to the flow section of class, which is very fun - 4 songs (usually upbeat modern songs that are fun to move to, but vary depending on the day and instructor) 2 of the songs are more difficult and are meant to raise your heart rate and the other two are more relaxing. The class then has a core section followed by floor poses, stretching, and relaxation. The formula is great because the 80 minutes go by quickly and you get an incredible workout. The only issue is that you can get hurt doing things so quickly if you do not pace yourself and be careful as you adjust your body to this kind of workout. Also, this location is often very busy, making for close quarters with other yoga goers. Despite this, if I had to only go to one yoga place in town, this would be it.

I came here with my friend Tom as part of our adventurous food tour of Phoenix :-P The place is cute, very small and colorful. The woman who worked there (owner?) was friendly and helpful...she answered all of my questions regarding the menu. She told me the Jerk was the spiciest, followed by the curry, then the stew I believe. So we ordered Jerk chicken and goat curry. So here was the problem. None of the food was the least bit spicy. Like...not spicy....at all. Second problem: There were A LOT of bones in the food...like choking hazard....I would cut off the smallest piece of meat and somehow it would have like 2-3 bones in it...who even knew that many bones existed in chicken or goat? The flavors were alright, but nothing special. Vaguely like Indian food. The rice and beans tasted alright, but some of the beans were undercooked. The plantains were good, or at least the ones on my plate, but they were inconsistent, as the ones on Tom's plate were soggy and not cooked enough. We each ended up paying, with tip and all, 15$...that is ridiculous for the quality of food we received. I feel bad for saying it but I probably would not go back....sorry guys!

So the BF and I felt like a burger at about 9:15 tonight (I know... we are sick people)... we found this place on yelp. I was kind of concerned that this place didn't really exist because the Lenny's website does not list this as a location. But it indeed exists! We went by and it was such a cute little place. It's a tiny place with 50's style booths and a drive through. So we got a couple burgers and an order of fries to share. The burgers were just alright.... nothing super special, but definitely not bad. The fries though..... mmmmm...... they were really good. Hot, crispy, and just the right amount of salt on them. They were seriously yummy. While we were there (for about 10 min) about 6 cars went through the drive through. At 9:30 on a Sunday! So there must be something good about it. Also, it was very reasonably priced. All of our food totaled around $10. Not bad.... I'd definitely go back.

So I was teetering between a five star and a four star but decided that my having a hangover on day two was not reeeally Devoured's fault...lol. I went to both days and must say that I think day one was a bit more fun (it was rainy and dreary which made the lines a little less intense and the food a little more satisfying (IMO). One of my faves from day one (and the winner of my day one Yelpee award for best overall performance and best dessert) was Gertrude's ... OMG they had a 'cookies and milk' play that was some kind of delicious ice cream on top of chocolate soup of sorts.....I LOVED that. Other honorable mentions include: Davanti Enoteca (full portions of pork sandwiches au jus.....ridiculously tasty and the smell was out of this world), the tiramisu from North, the ice cream sandwich from Churn (mint ice cream FTW), the whoopie pie from Whoopie Baking Company (seriously the best wp I have ever had...yum), and the short rib ravioli from Federal Pizza (When they had it again on day two I was doing a little happy dance, this ravioli was good...creamy cheese with amazing melty short rib in pasta...how could you go wrong? I was really turned off to FP, but now I am turned on once again! (TWSS)).   Day two was a beautiful sunny day in Phoenix, but also made for longer lines and more crowding. The crowd became close to unbearable in the back by Kai. I'm not sure why they had Kai and J&G and a couple of the other sought after booths all in the same section, but the crowd was completely insane. When I finally made it up to the Kai booth, the food wasn't even THAT amazing, but I'm glad I got to taste it before paying for it. Kai had a funky cheese 'cake,' Foie gras mousse (this was off putting....everyone around me thought so too), and a delicious creme brulee (that I have a feeling was not creme, but something much fancier). They served their food in cute reusable dish wear, but only had ONE recycle station that was completely engulfed in the mob of a line that was around Kai. Needless to say, a lot of the adorable glass bottles and bamboo spoons were left on the tables in that section.   Ok, on to my own personal Yelpee awards for day two: Best overall performance- Different Pointe of View for their Venison. Holy mother of someone..... this was so flippin delicious. The meat was the most tender meat I have had in a very long time. The polenta cake was amazing. The personal talk with the employees at the booth was even great. I never wanted to go to their restaurant, and now I definitely do, so bravo to them! The winner of best dessert goes to Kai for their delish creme brulee thingy (although they definitely get the winner of most pretentious booth with the biggest crowd sooo...). Honorable mentions go out to: Short leash...always delicious, friendly, and personable (Thanks Brad and Kate!), J&G - their steak with the cheese ball was really good, my only issue was the steak was super rare for me, but the flavor was great, House of Tricks - their duck soup was my second favorite dish overall of the day, so yummy with an awesome play on flavor and texture, Federal Pizza's short rib ravioli (again), Barrio Cafe (always delicious...this was no exception), and (surprisingly) the vegan salad from Brat house was very fresh and delicious.   The Yelpee for best drink? Definitely the cucumber concoction from Windsor...I drank too many of these.    Ok, Ok, this is all nice, but there are a few things that can be improved upon for this event next year including: Consider the lay out of the restaurants to include some lesser known or less desirable restaurants near the big draws to reduce the crowding in certain areas, make announcements of some kind when the demos start (maybe they did, but I didn't hear it and the one demo I went to started 20 minutes late so we were all sitting there like wtf for 20 minutes), put out recycle bins, don't make us carry one wine glass around all day so we don't have two hands to eat the food with....or provide one of those nifty wine glass slings or trays with the glass, and (I never ever thought I would say this but....) make the portion sizes smaller! Yes, I did say smaller. I had full plates of food being passed out by some of the vendors (*cough* chelsea's kitchen and Davanti*cough*...in fact, I didn't even try Chelsea's kitchen because I knew I wouldn't want that whole plate and didn't want to waste it). I love getting a big plate of food, but when there are 30+ places to try, I felt guilty wasting a ton of food due to either not liking the item or just being too full to eat that much. I bet at least 5000$ worth of food was just thrown away over the weekend due to large portion sizes. If the restaurants gave out a bite or two each, that would be perfect and reduce all of the waste (and allow people to go back and try their favorites again without being WAY too stuffed to do so). Overall, this event was amazing and I will attend next year again!

This place is pretty tasty... I went here tonight with the BF and another couple after wanting to go for months.. MONTHS! and it still didn't disappoint, so that's how you know it's good. We started with some drinks, I had a peach bellini, which was good, the BF had a manhattan, and he said it was very good, I thought it was good too, but I haven't had one before, so I don't know how it compares. We had the bruschetta, which was pretty good, but could have been better with some balsamic I think. The real star is, of course, the pizza. The BF and I split the fried pizza.... wow! What a brilliant idea! It was like pizza inside a light fluffy doughnut. Plus, the mozz they use is wonderful and so are the tomatoes.... very good. The other couple had a pizza with prosciutto on it and a pizza with roasted veggies (can't remember the names...). I didn't try the veggie, but it smelled very fresh and delicious like bell pepper. I tried the prosciutto and it was very good, and they didn't skimp on it either... this pizza was covered. It was pretty tasty. I would say that it is not the best pizza in phoenix... but it is good and worth a return visit. We finished with the tiramisu, which ended up not being great, but not being bad. So I would definitely go back and get the pizza... I would also like to try the salad, as the ones I saw looked really good. So yay pomo! Way to make tasty pizza!

The husband and I went to Zinburger last week after having apps at Seasons 52 in the same shopping center. We weren't quite full and had a gift card, so figured we would go share a burger. There was a bit of a wait, and the waitress informed us that it was a little bit of a CF in the kitchen that night, but it seemed alright to us. Anyway, we sat on the patio after waiting for 20 min or so and ordered the ringer burger and a bananas foster shake to split. Well, I was impressed, because they brought out both items split for us in separate glasses/plates. That's awesome! The ringer burger was very tasty, it was just a little spicy with the right amount of crunchiness....I would definitely get one of these again. The shake was ah mazing. I don't even typically like shakes, but the banana mixed with the caramel was to die for. I am not a huge fan of most Fox restaurants, but this one was a winner for me. Will be back!

Um... Yum! This place was surprisingly good. I have had ramen (real ramen) one other time in Seattle, and I thought it was alright, but this was really good! I got the shio broth, which was good, kind of a standard clear broth, and I added garlic and got chicken in it. The guy at the counter was super helpful, and he helped me pick out what to put in the soup... he didn't even seem (that) annoyed by all of my questions either, so that was nice. I really liked the way they garnished the soup, it had spinach, carrot, sprouts, and green onions. It looked really colorful and added some dimension to the soup. I added some of their spicy seasoning stuff and it was good. The noodles were really tasty, they were just the right texture for ramen, a little chewy. Gotta like that! Also, the chicken surprised me in how good it was! It looked not so great in the bowl, but when I tried it, it was so tender... like infused with the broth and melting in my mouth.... so good. The portion size is huge, I couldn't finish it. I will definitely come back here... if it was good in the summer, I can only imagine it will be great in the winter!

My friend won big at the casino today.... and so she took us to dinner....hooray! This place is expensive.... like almost Vegas expensive BUT it was better than the majority of the Vegas buffets... and I have done some serious buffeting. They had american kobe steaks that were tender and delicious. Creamy mashed potatoes. Tender broccolini. Wonton soup that is actually good (fairly rare for a buffet). Really good garlic bread. And to top it off.... A fancy cheese, meat, and fig display. The only thing that was not awesome was the lamb leg...but it still wasn't bad. The dessert set up was pretty awesome... fresh fruit, all different types of pies, tarts, cakes, ice cream, sorbet, and even fresh made bananas foster. I ate so much dessert. It was sick. They had some delicious chocolate mousse, tarts, and the bananas foster was excellent.... I am so glad we gave this place a try and I would definitely come back for another special occasion.   This buffet does a very good job of making you feel like you are in a nice restaurant and not necessarily a buffet. The buffet is separated from the dining room and there is very attentive service bringing drinks (all non alcoholic drinks included) and clearing plates. Gotta like that. Plus we had a view of the pool... not such a bad view.

I went to the Duce this weekend for the first time and can not believe I have not gone before! This place is so much fun. They have a boxing ring, hula hoops, exercise equipment, shuffle board, corn hole, a fun and lively dance floor and ping pong. They serve beer like Old Milwaukee....so, in other words, the BF's dream bar. But he was not there, I went with Erin B. for her bachelorette party. The drinks were very expensive, but they were fresh, tasty, and packed an alcoholic punch. My philosophy is that if I am going to pay upwards of 10$ for a drink, it better be all made in house with fresh fruit and this was, so I can't complain. A few of us went up and did a few exercises on the wall where you hold up your body and lift your knees to your chest, I did 3 and was very proud of myself....then a couple girls came over and really showed us up...they were aerial pole dances and were hanging upside down by one arm and whatnot....very fun to watch. I think the best part of this bar is that it can be whatever you want it to be....it can be quiet and laid back in some areas, full of games and entertainment in some areas and a dance club in others. I will definitely be back to this bar again.   PS funny story....I had already had a good amount of alcohol upon arrival. We were all standing by the trailer waiting to order beers. I saw that there was a satellite dish on the wall and thought 'wow..that's an odd thing to use as kitch...' I continued staring at the ceiling like an idiot when a plane flew overhead and I realized we were still outside...obviously it was a good night.

I stayed here the last weekend for my friend's birthday. She got 2 free rooms on the 11th floor from her player's card (woohoo, thanks Ashley!). The rooms here are nice, they are new and good looking. The bathroom is large and has a shower where the head come straight down from the ceiling...pretty cool stuff. My only problem with the room is the bathroom door. It doesn't really close....it slides shut, but not really all the way. Who wants to go to the bathroom without a completely shut door? How weird.... Anyway, the pool is nice, large and a comfortable temperature. Same with the hot tub. I think the casino is a bit weak, it could use more machines, but it's fine. I would stay here again (especially if it's free!)

I went into beat coffeehouse to escape a sudden downpour. This coffee house was unusual to say the least, with a tough-looking bouncer outside the door. I was excited to try a dirty chai latte, if for no other reason than because I was chilled from the storm. The Latte was priced at an average $5. The girl who made the latte seemed like she had never made coffee before. I have a feeling that she spends most of her time pouring beers. She continually stopped the coffee-making process to pour other patrons beers , which I found very unusual. When I finally received the dirty chai latte, it was undrinkable. The milk hadn't been properly foamed and the flavor was off. I drink about a quarter of the latter and threw the rest away. I think this place might be fine for beers or to look for albums, but I would definitely pass on the coffee.

The noodles here are so good! I love their pot stickers. They have the perfect ratio of meat to noodle and they have a really good sauce as well. I also ordered the xo spicy noodles. The noodles were great, but the meat was not so good. Also, it didn't have a ton of noodles on the plate. Next time I'll order it without the meat, I want more noodles!! I will definitely eat here again, I will just avoid the beef.

This aquarium is a bit lack luster, though I don't know what I expected from an aquarium in a mall. There are many fish here, but not many other sea animals and the displays are less than exciting. I would say this is equivalent or less impressive than the aquarium section of the wildlife world zoo in the west valley. For the price, I probably would not come back here.

I recently began going to Hot Yoga Ahwatukee as it is close to work and convenient for after work classes. I like the facility, it is very spacious, clean, nicely decorated, and welcoming. This place is like the Tardis (for you whovians), it is way bigger on the inside. The classes vary depending on the instructor. I like to go to the 4 o clock class, which is a one hour class, but have also attended the 5:15 class which is 75 minutes long. I will say, this is a less intense yoga practice, sort of between bikram and sumits, it is slower and less intense than sumits, but not so slow and somewhat boring like Bikram is.... it truly is a happy medium. The room isn't as humid or hot as others I have been to in town (leaving here, I look like a slightly sweaty person, not a person who just jumped in a pool), and the classes have been busy, but not so busy that I have to be on top of the people next to me (which is great!). I would suggest this location for anyone looking for a nice middle of the road difficulty yoga class that will give you a nice, yet relaxing, workout and leave you feeling good after. As long as I work in the area, I will continue to attend this studio.

It's always a little uncomfortable to be the naysayer in a sea of ... yay... sayers? Heh. Anyway, I think maybe the problem is that I came to Athens for dinner... on a weekend... and this place is more like a lunch place possibly.   The place was completely empty, which maybe should have been a warning. My friend and I had decided to come here because we could get food and it was also a bar ( hence the name bar and grill). Well, the bar is more like the bar one would have in their home... there are a few bottles of alcohol there, but a bar that does not make. So cocktails were (sadly) not had.   We did, against our better judgment, get some food. I had a chicken pita and we shared some greek fries. The fries were alright, just fries with some feta on top essentially. I know the owner ( or whoever was there) made them fresh, so that was a plus. The pita was fairly lackluster. The sauce on it was flavorless and the chicken was underseasoned. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't something I would want to eat again either.   Besides the mediocre food, we were very disappointed by the lackluster service. Like I said, we were the only ones there, but we waited a long time for any drink refills and for our check. The guy who works there (or owns the place) was sitting at his little desk by the kitchen ignoring us most of the time, which I totally get, since having one table is probably excruciatingly boring, but being that they decided to be open for dinner, they should treat it like it's actually business hours. I probably won't be back.

This was a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting what most people described on Yelp, meeting the owner and having really fresh, not 'really' a buffet food. I guess that isn't the case at lunch (?). I took two friends here the other day for lunch. They started us with chicken soup (as it was the only soup they had) and it was fine, not the best thing ever, but not bad. Then we got a salad, which had spicy dressing, but other than that, was just salad from a bag.... kind of disappointing. We also were supposed to get a starter of sorts as stated on this website, but we didn't. Lame. The buffet was pretty pathetic, it featured some clearly frozen gyoza (like the ones you buy at trader joes.... gross), the nastiest pad thai I have ever had.... really weird flavor, some decent (but not hot... spicy or temperature wise) curries (green and red), white rice, and some crappy fried rice. The best thing was the red curry, but it still did not measure up to other restaurants. The redeeming quality of this restaurant was the dessert.... whoa that was something special. It was sticky rice with coconut ice cream and it was just fabulous. I would go there just to get some of that.... but the rest of the food was not fresh and was not warm or particularly tasty. I regret taking my friends here, and I wish I had had the experience that many of the other Yelpers report.... maybe if the owner had been there it would have been different.

Ok, so my hypothesis was correct....lunch here...not so good....dinner here when the owner is present....Wonderful!!! I have been back twice at dinner times and it has been really good each time. The soup (which wasn't that great at lunch time) has been VERY good at dinner....spicy and a little sweet with a lemongrass flavor. The salad dressing was also much better the last couple times with a really savory and delicious sesame and something sweet flavors....yum. The buffet has been good, with several curries that have all been tasty, but tonight I had the best one...it's a light green or yellow curry that is very savory at the front and then super spicy at the back end. Of course, the dessert is just as fantastic as it was the first time. Not tonight, but the last time I was there, we got this mango pastry type thing with the coconut ice cream and sticky rice....this time, no pastry, but some fresh mango. Both times it was amazing. I wish I could just eat that sticky rice all the time.... Even the BF who is very picky liked this place a lot and said it reminded him of his Thai neighbor's home cooking from when he was a kid. Pretty good stuff....

So I have been to all of the other Chompie's, and I must say that this one is the nicest looking one. I went here this morning with the BF and a couple of our friends for breakfast. So the coffee here is just as atrocious as at the other locations.... it is so bad. Normally I can drink a cup of coffee with only half a creamer, but here I put in two creamers and it still tasted terrible. I tried something new today and got the Cabo skillet. It has home fries with bell pepper, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, green chilis, new mexican chili, tomatoes, and scallions in it. Then they melt jalapeno jack cheese on top and put some slices of avocado on that AND it has two eggs on top which I ordered over medium. This thing was good. I mean super good! It was just the right amount of spicy, it did not need any salt and pepper (and I love salt and pepper on my eggs) and it did not need ketchup. It was pretty wonderful and huge, I couldn't eat it all. This is definitely the best thing I've ever had at chompies. Oh, so it comes with a bagel on the side, and mine was a little burnt.... but normally the bagels here are pretty good. The BF got biscuits and gravy and thought they were a bit too sweet, but I don't know about that because I don't like biscuits and gravy and didn't taste it. Our friends got a different skillet and an omelet of sorts, and both said it was really good.   Overall, this was a Chompie's win, especially in comparison to the last few times I've been and it wasn't so good.   Also, bring back the Lovie's difficult decision! That was the best thing ever! (a piece of kugel, a latke, a blintz, and a cup of matzo ball soup.... all of my faves on one plate.)

The husband and I came here for their lovely happy hour! The prices here are generally pretty steep (you can't get a burger for less than a whopping 16$), but the happy hour has some serious deals. We tried the wagyu burger sliders (3$ each) and the pulled pork sliders (5$ for 3 of them). Surprisingly, the burger sliders were not the stars... they put too much thousand island on them which buried the taste of the meat (which is why the burger is so expensive, right?)... They certainly weren't bad, but I wish the flavor of the meat came through more. The star was the pork slider... these things were legit! The sauce was delicious, tangy and spicy. The slaw on top was crisp and added the texture the sliders needed. The portion was large for 5$ (on the reg menu, this same dish is 13$!!!). I would come back for these sliders. For drinks, the husband had a beer and I had a marg... the marg was a good size for the happy hour price, but the flavor was nothing special. Anyway, I will most likely return for happy hour and would like to come for brunch (the menu looks awesome and they have a brunch burger with an egg and hollandaise on it.... sounds great to me!).

So I went here this morning for breakfast and it was sooo good! I bought the groupon for brunch a few days ago and I'm glad I did. The bf and I went this morning at around nine and there was only one other couple in the restaurant. We sat down and ordered coffee and by the time we got our coffee the whole restaurant was full, so that was nice! The coffee was really good, The flavor of the coffee itself was good and they brought out a little dish of heavy whipping cream to put in it so that was delicious. Also the coffee came in this big saucer like cup which was really cute and required two hands to drink from it. Anyway.... I ordered the italian skillet and the BF ordered the blackberry waffle (which they served in place of the strawberry waffle today) and we got a little basket of pastries to share. The pastries were delicious. There were four different kinds, little mini chocolate croissants (mmmm), little blackberry danish, little orange (I think) danish, and a cute little star pastry with raspberry. They came out hot, straight from the oven, and they were really special. My skillet was also delicious, it was potatoes with cheese, caramelized onion, pesto, and two poached eggs. The eggs were perfect and the pesto tasted so good. The BF's waffle was really awesome though.... It had blackberries and whipped cream (real whipped cream, like it tasted like heavy whipping cream, not super sweet) and honey (they offered him a lemon and apple compote but he refused...he's crazy). He let me have a bite and it was the lightest most delicious waffle I have ever had. So why 4 stars? I just can't let go of my last visit here which wasn't awesome. I am going to go back one of these days for dinner and if it is as good as breakfast was... I will definitely up it to 5 stars. Yum.

Ok... So I know this is the third update, but this place has really earned its stars! The BF and I went here for brunch on Sunday and it was one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it was like having brunch over at a friend's house. The chef, Eric, hung out with us and chatted with us about various topics throughout brunch and it was very pleasant. On top of that, the food was absolutely wonderful. We started with 5$ mimosas, which were large and incredibly tasty and coffee, which they serve with real cream... for real! I had an omelet with spinach, caramelized onions, roasted garlic, pancetta, and aged white cheddar. Eric suggested putting hollandaise sauce onto the omelet. Genius! It was creamy, savory, salty, sweet, and all around delicious. The BF had a blackberry waffle that had a mountain of fresh whipped cream that was actually whipped cream, not from a can or a tub.... Soooooo goooood. The quality of what you get at this restaurant is definitely worth the price and I, of course, will be back.    If you want a friendly and comfortable place where you can get delicious and expertly prepared food... come here!!!

Oh. My. God. Holy crap this was wonderful! Better than I expected by a million. The BF and I shared a salted caramel and it was perfect! The salty and the sweet together were an amazing combo and the texture was wonderful. It was even refreshing on a hot day... which I didn't think it would be. I want this again... like right now.

This place is fairly cheap and looks like it could be fun, but tonight it was kind of empty, although we went fairly early. They had karaoke which was extremely loud and the bar had many older people there. Our waiter was not super awesome, we waited for a long time to get our tab and came to find out he was singing karaoke.... very poorly. So that is not real appealing. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go here.

Well.... I hate to be a downer, but I've been to Peru, and this was not so much. I met my step mom here for dinner one night and it wasn't busy. The waiter we had was very odd... he stood far from the table... like a good 4 feet... and sort of behind me, it was quite awkward. We asked him for recommendations on an appetizer after being told they were out of our first choice (papa rellena) and he said the yucca  knowing we were ordering the lomo with chicken (which comes with fries). The yucca was pretty much made just like fries and tasted like flavorless fries... not cool. The green sauce that came with them was alright, but the yellow sauce was gloppy and not so good. We didn't finish them. The lomo was fine, but lacking in sauce... not even enough to wet the rice or the fries.... the chicken was dry... it really was nothing special. I wouldn't go back.   PS the prices were really expensive for what we got

This place was recommended to me by two coworkers when I was in desperate need of a massage and didn't want to spend a lot of money. I have been to other reflexology places, which are very good, but this place was possibly even better! I easily made an appointment for the same day over the phone. When I got there they were ready to go. I went straight back and was surprised to be taken to a small private room, not the usual large room with multiple massages going on that I have seen at other reflexology places. The lady frankly told me to take off my shirt while she stood there, which was a bit weird given all other reflexology places I have been to leave you fully clothed, but I happily obliged. I laid down and a man (Andy I think) came in to complete the massage. He was awesome and gave a very relaxing and thorough massage, which included massaging all of the usual places and my face and head (awesome). Additionally, they did some stretching with my legs and arms that felt really good. My only complaint is I wish he spent a little more time on my back and slightly less on my feet, but I didn't tell him that, so I can't hold it against him. For 30$ per hour, you really can't beat this place. I will be back!

Whoa. This place was good.  I went here today with a friend after my dad told me that it was so good. I went in at around 2:30 which is happy hour (but I didn't know that!) So stupidly I didn't order anything off the happy hour menu... not their fault, but man I felt dumb. Anyway, I ordered a carne asada burrito and a mexican coke. It was expensive! When the food came out a few minutes later I was really happy cuz I was really hungry. The burrito was great! The meat was so flavorful and tender and the guac was delicious. When I go back, I will for sure note the happy hour and get tacos (1$ !!!) and chips and salsa (my friend got them and they were good... .50!!) and maybe a beer or margarita. I definitely will be back, it was super yum.

So I think I am a taco addict. But no need for intervention.... I come here quite often and every time it is just wonderful! I am almost embarrassed to go here because I think the people who work here remember me.... but that can't keep me away from the taco goodness.   So the carne asada is wonderful, but I have found it to be much more wonderful on the vampiro. The vampiro is a masterpiece. It is like a tostada, in that it has a crunchy tortilla as a base. Then it is topped with caramelized onion, lettuce, guac, Carne asada, and maybe cilantro or something? Add some extra spicy salsa and I am a very happy girl.   In addition, I was scared to try the al pastor for awhile, and then I tried it and realized the wonder of their pork. Wow. It is good. They have it on a rotating stick, almost like gyro meat, with a chunk of pineapple on top... with the pineapple juice just dripping onto the pork. One time we went and they were out of pork and I almost cried. No joke. It is that good. I get it on a taco, which has a slice of the pineapple (best topping), guac, onion, and cilantro. super yum.   The extra spicy salsa is really good. It is the perfect amount of spicy to make my nose run a little. It also tastes incredibly fresh, like everything here.   This is the kind of place where I tell a friend I went here and they are sad that I didn't bring them....So go here.... Go here right now!

MMMMM I came here tonight because I had bought a living social deal (20$ for 40$) and wanted to use it. It went way beyond my expectations. The outside kind of looks like it could have been a strip club (was it?), but the inside was so pretty. It was warm and inviting and the table we were sitting at had a red comfy couch bench. woot to that. We ordered the bruschetta (which my bf mispronounced and was corrected by I believe the woman owner of the restaurant). It was sooo good. It had a thick, sweet, obviously aged balsamic over the top that was wonderful and the tomato was incredibly fresh. They also gave us pizza crust type bread with the meal that was very good. For entrees I ordered the in house made raviolis and the bf ordered fusilli strozzapreti (also mispronounced, lol). Mine was ok, BUT the bf's was sooooo good. It had little pieces of bacon and asparagus and the freshest tasting peas and garlic *drool* Why does he always order better than me? We finished with the tiramisu which was made by our server......... ohhh so good. It was just perfect, not too heavy, not too light, just yum. Also, we got cappuccino, which was some of the best I have had in phoenix. Overall, this place was awesome, and oh, did I mention the whole thing came out to 47$!?!?! So affordable. I will be back.

So this place continues to be delicious. The BF and I went here on saturday night with his parents for his b day. The woman owner was super sweet and made sure we were well taken care of. We ordered a pizza to share as an appetizer and it was wonderful. We hadn't had the pizza before, and it truly was great. It was italian style, kind of like Bianco, and the crust was that perfect thin but not crispy consistency. The one we got had sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic, and fontina and it was so tasty! the garlic was that perfect kind of sweet garlic. I ordered the fettuccine alla burina and it was soooo good. It had a creamy garlic sauce and little english peas, prosciutto, and mushrooms. It was great. So the BF ordered the asparagus capellini, which was surprisingly delicious. I usually find pasta with just olive oil and veggies kind of boring, but this one was exceptional. I think it's because the veggies are so flavorful. We also got tiramisu (of course) and it was just as good as I remember. This is probably my favorite italian restaurant in the valley, it is great! I have not had a bad thing here.

Ok, this place exceeded my expectations! I was kind of wary about the weird toppings, but it was excellent. So I went to First Friday last night with a few friends and we were walking around, people watching, and looking at the... interesting....art showings, and then we stumbled upon short leash dogs! Well. I have been wanting to try one for some time, but generally I'm not in the same area as this food truck, so there was no doubt that I would be getting one. My friend and I shared one, cuz there was more food to be had. We got the Aiko with no mayo on a regular hotdog. The naan was perfect for the dog, it was so soft, warm, and delicious. The toppings (mango chutney, onion, jalapeno, cilantro) were absolutely delicious and fresh tasting on the dog. The cilantro really made it something special. So this place really impressed me. I will definitely need to go back and try more dogs before I can give it five stars, but this is a wonderful place, everyone should go get one of these hot dogs.... yum.

Since my previous review I have been to Short Leash several times and each time it is just wonderful! I recommend trying their specials from week to week...they are often way better than their standard menu items. The food here is great, but the more impressive thing is the service! The owners of the truck are friendly and genuine people. Who wouldn't like this place??!!?! well...obviously no one, look at the reviews.

This was definitely a meh experience....although I guess that should have been expected. I built my own burger with a wheat bun, cheddar, lettuce, haystack onion, ketchup and mustard. It was greasy and underwhelming. All I could taste was the mustard.... I think there was too much of it. The BF and I shared some smashfries which were weird tasting.... not really good.... just weird. I was hoping for more garlic flavor. Overall.... it was just a meh experience.

I went here tonight with the BF and it was a fairly good experience. We had a coupon from the ASU coupon book for a free cheese crisp with any purchase... well the cheese crisp was good. I know, I know, it's hard to mess up a cheese crisp.... but we had a bad one a week or two ago... so this was a nice change. It was crispy, like it should be, and a fairly standard cheese crisp. We also got a chicken fajita burrito... this was good, there were red, orange, and yellow bell peppers in there and they tasted fairly fresh. It came with rice, and it was flavorful. This place is definitely americanized mexican food.... but it was good and I would come back.

The BF and I went to Nobuo last night for the first time with a local dines deal. The place is cute, it's an old house and you sit in one of many small rooms.  As we were seated, we overheard some other people complaining about their experience...uh oh. So, needless to say, I was a little worried. We ordered a whole bunch of things to share. We got the sugar snap peas, the fried and stuffed squash blossom, a special that was fried octopus balls (as in they were in a ball shape....stop being dirty :-P) , the sea bass and mushrooms wrapped in a pouch of sorts, and another special which was local chicken 3 ways. I also got a cocktail, the grog, and we shared the mousse for dessert (it was a pretty indulgent night). Here's the breakdown:  Sugar snap peas: this was not my fave, but the BF liked it a lot. It was a little fishy and served cold, and I just didn't totally love it, but he ate it all.   Fried squash blossom: I loved this dish! It was stuffed with goat cheese, was light and crunchy, and I thought it was soooo delicious. The BF didn't like it, but he's a goat cheese hater.   Octopus balls: The garlicky sauce was good, the breading was good, octopus has a weird texture, but overall, I liked it, they did the best they could I think with this odd ingredient.   Sea bass: This was the star of the show...the sea bass was not fishy. It fell apart. It was savory and delicious. The mushrooms were luscious, earthy, and added tons of flavor to the fish....I could eat this fish any day of the week...so yummy.   Chicken 3 ways: Again, this was pretty delicious. The chicken was served: panko fried, wasabi grilled, and marinated in a soy onion mixture. The panko fried was good, but pretty expected. The wasabi grilled was awesome, I could feel the spice in my nose and the chicken was so moist, but the clear winner on the plate was the onion soy chicken....oh em gee.... this had such a wonderful savory and sweet flavor.   The grog: This cocktail was strong! But it had a nice honey and orange flavor....definitely worth the 11$ because one was certainly enough.   The Mousse: oh so chocolately and creamy...the green tea ice cream complemented it very well (and I do not care for green tea desserts). We were told that the secret behind this (and don't read this if it might ruin your experience) is that they use tofu in it to give it that silky texture...brilliant!   Overall, I really enjoyed our meal there and would definitely go back again (although I would order a little less cuz we were stuuuuuffed).

I went to this place last friday as I got a wonderful Groupon now deal... 1$ for 10$. Sweet! The place is very cute and I appreciate that they make all of the paletas in house and use fresh ingredients. We got an orange creamsicle, nuez (pecan), arroz con leche, and banana/rum one. Some were better than others... the BF loved the orange and I thought the nuez was excellent. The banana was not as awesome as I expected, but it was still good. The arroz con leche was also good, but not my fave. The paletas are super cute, with a little 'bite' taken out of each one. They are affordable and you can get a few and keep them in your freezer. I'll definitely be back.

Let me start by saying this review really isn't fair. I got to come here for an elite event and from that event I got a coupon for free bowling... I did buy drinks though! Anyway, Lucky Strike is a chain of bowling alley/ bars. This one, like others I have been to, is clean and has a 'fun' atmosphere. We came in the afternoon and got to bowl for an hour, which was great! We had some chips and salsa, which was tasty, and mac and cheese bites, which were not as good as they sound, but alright. You're not here to eat, right? They have a decent happy hour with discounted food and drinks. We had a couple beers which were fairly priced under 5$. I would definitely come back!

I grew up with pv mall. That being said, I frequented the Harkins inside the mall as a child. As I got older, I moved away and never really had a reason to return...until this week! A couple friends of mine invited me to go to the movies and it turned out none of us had been to the picture show at pv mall. This theatre brand has a little bit of a discount theatre feel... They sold their tickets at the concession stand and the tickets were just scraps of receipt paper, not your typical card stock fare.  Regardless, our matinee movie had only come out a week or two ago and cost 5$ to see...can't beat that! The theatre itself was a vast improvement on the old Harkins. They put in fairly comfortable chairs and stadium seating. If I were in the area, I would definitely return!

So I went here last night with the BF after getting our 24 hour coffee at Xtreme Bean. I had heard all of the rave reviews of this place, and decided we must try it while we were just passing by. We went through the drive through at around 11:30pm and the man who was at the window was very friendly. We got a chocolate devil's food and a strawberry. They came out hot.... Whoa. Hot donuts at 11:30pm?!?!?! blew my mind. I don't think I have ever had hot donuts in the middle of the night. Both of the donuts were good... warm, crunchy in parts, melty in parts. yum. This place has not jumped on the weird flavor bandwagon of several donut shops I have been to (eg voodoo donuts in portland, Donut Man in Glendora, CA), so you can't get a bacon maple bar or a fruit loop donut, or a fresh sliced strawberry donut, or anything like that, but that's ok, this is not that kind of place.  I may not be a great judge of donuts, as generally donuts is one of my least favorite desserts, but these were some very good ones. I would definitely recommend them(and they were way better than Donut Man... so take that food network!)!

So I went here tonight with a friend. I was really excited and nervous to try this place after reading the reviews. So you walk in and walk up to the counter to order. I got the chicken with cardamom sauce and my friend got a hamburger (boring!). So you also get to choose a side and three salads. I got the mashed potatoes, the tomato and basil salad, the spinach, and the broccoli. So the chicken was really good, especially with the mashed potatoes. As good as this was, though, the salads were the best part. The tomato basil was really flavorful and fresh and the spinach was really good with the honey mustard dressing. The broccoli was just that, plain broccoli... so not awesome, but not bad. My friend really enjoyed his burger and said that he does not usually like salad, but liked the salads here. So overall this place was really good and I will definitely be back to try other menu items in the future. All the people who work there are really friendly and they all have accents... very authentic. Oh, and I didn't try them, but they also sell chocolate beaver balls... actual name.

I went here last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! This bar is busy, but not crowded like the bars in Scottsdale. I had room to breathe. They were playing upbeat music, but it wasn't so loud that you couldn't have a conversation. The art in this place is interesting and the misters on the patio make it very pleasant (even when it's really hot outside). I definitely want to come try the food here, especially because they have some awesome deals during the week (5$ patty melts on Mondays...count me in!). I will be back.

The bf and I went to get breakfast at Joe's yesterday and it was shockingly good! I didn't expect much, despite the good reviews, hence my hesitation to go to this place after living nearby for over a year. The food is simple, but good. The bacon was super crispy, which I really enjoyed. Their biscuits are buttery and delicious. Their potatoes were ok. The bf liked the biscuits and gravy and the coffee was good. I'll definitely be back soon! Ps- they're going to be moving over to 7th ave soon.

I really like buffalo wild wings. I always get the boneless wings, which I like because it allows me to forget that I'm eating meat. Meat on the bone almost always freaks me out a little because it makes me think about it too much.... but that's just me. I like their sauces, especially the spicy garlic.... yum. I thought this location was on par with the other locations I've been to (scottsdale, fiesta mall, chandler, portland) and our server was nice and attentive last night. My friend and I also got drinks (a daiquiri and a bahama mama (?)) and they were both really tasty 'girl' drinks. The place wasn't super busy for around 10:30 on a saturday, but that's fine with me, I'd rather not wait. Oh and yay to trivia!!!!

I went back here last night because I got home late and couldn't think of another place that would be open. Well, this experience was much less impressive than last time. We had a clueless waitress. She was extremely slow. We got drinks, which were fine, but extremely overpriced (the BF got a beer and it was 6$?!?! more than my cocktail! WTF). We also got water to go with our wings. So we got our wings, which were fine, but then the waitress disappeared. Our waters remained empty for a looong time. We also waited about 25 minutes to get our check. It was ridiculous. So when we finally got the bill, I noticed we were charged about 3$ for carrots and celery. Really??? I thought when she asked if we wanted some with the wings, it was a standard thing. I've been going to Buffalo wild wings for 6 years and have never been charged for carrots and celery. In addition, we got like 5 scrawny carrots.... we didn't even eat it all, we just figured we'd get some with the wings cuz why not? Well, we found out why not. So we pay, and on the way out, we found out what was keeping our waitress so busy while we sat there waiting for ridiculous periods of time- She was sitting at the front of the restaurant with about 5 other employees talking. Seriously?!?! That is ridiculous. I am all for enjoying work and even chatting a bit, but they should at least have a view of the dining room in order to attempt to give decent service. I really don't want to continue giving my business to this company after that experience.

I'm surprised by the glowing reviews that are on here about this place. I bought a Groupon for this place based on the good reviews. The Bf and I made the trek down there tonight from mesa. Well..... the place is nothing to look at, just a little store front that kind of looks like an order at the counter kind of place but there is table service. So I ended up ordering the spinach ravioli and the BF got the 'park place' sandwich. My ravioli came with a salad, and I got a caesar. It tasted bland and like the dressing came out of a bottle. I wouldn't recommend it. My dinner also was supposed to come with bread.... it never came. My raviolis were fine in flavor, they came out warm...not hot.... and seemed like they came from a package, not fresh. The sauce was a standard marinara. The portion was not overly large, not ridiculously small though either. The BF was informed that they were out of all breads except the standard sesame seed. His sandwich was basically swiss, roast beef, and turkey. The bread was hard and the sandwich was bland. I could have had better at the grocery store. Since we still had money left on the groupon, we decided to order the tiramisu. It was supposedly home made. Well if it was.... someone who knows nothing about tiramisu made it. It was extremely dry and had no coffee flavor at all. In fact, it tasted like dry cinnamon.... not what a tiramisu should taste like. Also, the 'mascarpone' part tasted more like frosting (?). This was one of the worst tiramisus I have ever had. So, needless to say, I won't be back.

So I must be crazy, because every time I see a groupon for this place, I buy it.... I think my memories and actual experiences do not line up. So I had yet another deal for this place, and I decided to go there with the BF for lunch today to celebrate end of school. The place was fairly empty, but the decor is still nice. I ended up ordering the bhan mi sandwich at the suggestion of the waitress and the BF got the turkey sandwich. We both got the side of the day which was a sweet potato corn bread with honey and fruit butter. So the sandwiches come out and I was a bit confused. On the menu it said that the bhan mi was roasted pork with carrots, cilantro, cucumber, and a sriracha mayo. Well.... this sandwich was not roasted pork. It was strips of ham... like deli ham. WTF? This sandwich costs $10.50. I could go buy some deli meat and veggies and throw it in a pan for 5 seconds for about 2$. I don't even like ham and would never order a ham sandwich. Isn't this restaurant supposed to be all about freshness and organic and whatnot? Because deli ham is anything but.... Why can America's tacos sell delicious roasted pork for about 2$ and this place doesn't even really use roasted pork? In addition, I was about half done with the first half of the sandwich and I found a whole slice of jalapeno in my mouth. My mouth was on fire. I couldn't eat anymore of the sandwich. My eyes were watering.... and I like spicy and use jalapenos in a lot of my cooking. Ugh. I liked the turkey sandwich, but on the menu it states that it comes with bacon.... well no bacon. Really center bistro? Why have a menu when apparently you just put whatever you feel like putting in the food? The corn bread was good and the butter that came with it was good too, but I felt extremely ripped off by my meal there today.... it was unacceptable.   I find myself wondering if their breakfast or newly added dinners would be better, as the dinner menu looks good, but I'm, worried if I go for something on said menu, I'll just get some random other thing that I did not want. So we'll see if I give it another go.

I went here today for lunch with my dad and it was very good! We split the pork tacos...which were awesome! Sweet, spicy, tangy...everything that you could want in a pork taco. We also got the chilled steak salad, which was surprisingly good as well. Both of these items were recommended by our waitress and both were good....so that was a plus. The two items were just enough for the two of us and it only cost about 17 dollars...not a bad deal. I will be back.

I made a triumphant return to Canteen last night with a couple of friends and, yet again, it was pretty awesome. When we got there, there was a wait BUT it was awesome because they take your phone number and call you when the table is ready, so no sitting around the restaurant awkwardly. I love that! The wait was much shorter than anticipated and we were seated outside, which was nice. We got Sonoma (?) margaritas...the ones with orange and prickly pear in them. They were soooo gooood. Sweet without being too sweet. We got the chips and salsa and I thought it was just ok. There were three different salsa, a verde, which was spicy but not super flavorful, a chipotle, which was really good, and a pico de gallo, which was...pico de gallo. I think 6$ is a little steep for this. The three of us ordered the quesadilla, the brisket tacos (because they were out of pork...booo!), and the carne asada tacos. The brisket tacos were good, but not nearly as good as the pork and the carne asada was just ok.... it kind of tasted like gas or propane or whatever chemical they use to grill things....I'd stick with the meats that are cooked low and slow here. Our service was fairly good, although my water was never refilled...maybe as a ploy for me to drink more alcohol...I'm not sure. I still like that this place is cheap and tasty...so it stands at four stars.

I came here this morning with the BF to use a living social deal I had bought recently. I was really excited to try this place, as it was crazy busy the last time I was there (on first friday), so I passed on it. This place is really cool, it has a nice atmosphere and feels homey and friendly. The whole street is like a little community, so it has a good feel, and I like to support that kind of business. I ordered an iced latte and the 'cannoli' crepe (ricotta, choco chips, almonds) and the BF got a hot latte and the PB, raspberry jam, and banana crepe. They were a bit chewy, but good flavor. The coffee was very good, it is made by cartel coffee, which I always like. I would definitely come back here to try different flavors and to drink yummy coffee.

This place was a disappointment. I thought it was going to be really cool, but I actually found it to be a bit weird. The employees weren't super friendly and didn't explain how the process worked, just said 'you want ice cream?' .... um, yes. So on their website they have a 'favorite' that was coconut ice cream with strawberries, pineapple, and coconut flakes. Then when I got there, the menu said it had mixed berries... not strawberries and pineapple. I still decided to get it. I ordered a small and got a huge portion. The ice cream had a weird texture and was not creamy like I would have expected. In addition, some of the berries just tasted like hard gas.... it was truly gross. The BF got the peanut butter and chocolate concoction. His was better, but had some parts that only had the cream, no flavor.... and that tasted weird. I would much rather go someplace that uses fresh ingredients and makes ice cream the old fashioned way....without the gimmick....

So the Bf and I gave this place a second chance for restaurant week. This time, the food was much better. So I was a little irked because we made a res for 8:45 and weren't seated til almost 9... BUT I know sometimes that happens and it's not really the restaurant's fault. So we both ate off the restaurant week menu. I started with their salad that has bell pepper, carrot, celery, cucumber, cranberry, corn, and a whole lot of delicious! The salad was lightly dressed and tasted amazing. The BF got the chicken meatballs... they were not what we expected... they had sort of a smokey flavor, they weren't bad, but I don't know that I would get them again. Oh, and they brought out the comp bread.... cheesey bread of wonderfulness... I wanted to ask for like 20 more of those. For entrees I had the pork green chili, and it was good. It was spicy and flavorful.... plus it came with some serious cornbread. The bread was crispy on one side and soft on the other... awesome! The BF got the meatloaf, and he totally beat me in awesomeness..... it was very tasty, light, and came with some smooth and delicious mashed potatoes. Yum. For dessert I had the pecan pie, which I thought was just ok.... the crust was awesome, but the filling was a little too figgy for my taste. The ice cream that comes with it was very good though. The BF got the bacon smores and he loved them! Chocolate covered bacon... pretty awesome. So overall, this place has been redeemed, but if I went again I probably would not get dessert... it just doesn't seem to be their strong point.

Ok, update three..... This place just keeps getting better and better. The BF and I went here last night for their first birthday party...and it was wonderful! Now, we went one of their first days last year for our anniversary and once our waitress found that out, we were treated wonderfully. We were given glasses of champagne on the house... how thoughtful! We ordered the grilled cheese as a starter, and it was good. A grilled cheese is a grilled cheese, but it was good... I loved the bacon inside and the soup it came with was smokey and delicious. For entrees I had the short rib and the BF had the shepherd's pie. The short rib was very good... fell apart and had a nice flavor. The mashed potatoes and green beans that came with it were also delicious. The BF's shepherd's pie was also delicious, but it came out on the cool side... BUT when our waitress was informed, she handled the situation perfectly. She apologized and replaced the meal quickly with a new one. The new one was perfect AND the size was much larger than the first time we went to this restaurant. We ordered the pecan fig pie for dessert and it was much better than the last time we had it. The pie had a nice consistency and the ice cream was very good. In addition, they brought us a piece of chocolate birthday cake that was rich and delicious. Needless to say, I was ridiculously stuffed. When we got our bill, we were informed that they comped our pie for our anniversary. So our bill was 18$. For real. They had entrees for 1$, comped champagne, comped pie, comped cake.... This was the best deal for a wonderful meal. The service, as always, was spot on, and I like that they really made us feel special for our anniversary. Thanks Beckett's Table for a memorable night!

Macarons = 5 stars, possibly the best I have ever had   Other pastry = 3 stars, nothing terribly special  I came here with a friend on our way out of Vegas. I was waffling on getting macarons, but I am so glad I did because they were excellent. I think they were everything a macaron should be and so different from others I have had other places that made me feel that I didn't like this pastry. I had the salted caramel (so freakin good) and the coffee (another excellent choice).   The other pastries I got - an apple turnover thing (kind of dry, not a lot of flavor) and a slice of the chocolate strawberry cake. Let me say that the cake slice was huge. Beyond huge. I ate this for 3 days and still ended up throwing half the slice away because it got too old. My box probably weighed 4 lbs or something. Anyway, the actual flavor of the cake was good, but nothing terribly special. The strawberries were fresh, but the chocolate wasn't very decadent.    Take home point: Get the macarons... yum.

I went here tonight with the BF to use our groupon, and we enjoyed it very much. We had a very friendly and helpful waiter named Casey, who was efficient and personable so that was really nice. We split the caprese salad, and the kitchen actually split it onto two plates for us, which was really nice. It had a chunk of mozz, a slice of beefsteak tomato and a bunch of little red and yellow tomatoes. I thought the mozz and the little tomatoes were good, but the beefsteak tomato was a bit firm. I ordered the special chicken sandwich they had today, which was very tasty. It was chicken on focaccia bread with arugula, onion, tomato jam, and garlic aioli. It was sweet and savory and the bread was really good. It came with sweet potato fries which were also good and plentiful (I took home like 2 sweet potatoes worth and ate like maybe a half a potato.... whoa). The BF got the burger and he loved it! It was perfectly cooked and had a nice flavor. He got waffle fries with his burger and they were delicious! They had a good seasoning on them and they were crunchy, but not too crunchy. The prices are also reasonable when you consider the amount of food that you get. So I would definitely come back here.

The BF and I went back here last night because he felt like a burger and it was 9 o clock and we didn't want fast food, so this place came to mind, despite the fact that it is far away from home. I was so impressed because our waiter, Casey, remembered us from the last time we were in and even remembered what was on special the night we came in..... it was kind of crazy, but I think it is so cool that a place like this has such good service. It was definitely unexpected. The BF got the burger again and he really loves it. He gets it with havarti cheese... it is good. I got a different special which was a flatbread with chicken, BBQ sauce, onion, bacon, cheese, and red jalapenos on it. This thing was good! It was spicy and sweet, which is a great combination, and the crust was very crispy, which gave it a nice texture. I also like that the bacon was there just to support the other flavors, it wasn't all about the bacon. I am not a bacon fan (despite being called crazy for this fact), so when I can eat something that just has a slight bacon flavor, that is perfect for me. The portions were large and the prices are pretty close to standard. Again, I would return.... this place has really impressed me.

So I went here with a friend for lunch yesterday and at first I thought it was going to be terrible, because when we walked in it smelled real bad in the restaurant. Thankfully, they lit some incense and the smell went away. I ordered the spicy noodles with chicken and my friend got the pad see ew. We both got salad with it because the soup was egg drop, which I'm not a fan of. The salad was just a rabbit salad from a bag, but the dressing was good. I really enjoyed my noodles. They were spicy and had lots of veggies, which I always like. I thought the spring roll had too much dough and was a little chewy... not awesome. My friend thought hers was ok... but it was weird that they didn't even offer to make it spicy like at most thai places. It did have a good sweet flavor, but it was odd that she couldn't order it with some heat. Overall, the place is good and I would probably come back.

Maybe it was an off day, but I thought the food today was not very good at all. The BF and I each got a 'k sadilla,' I got the steak and he got the chicken. Maybe this item isn't the best thing to get here... I don't know. It was soggy and had waaaay too much cheese. The steak was chewy and flavorless despite being labelled as 'cajun.' The k sadilla had cabbage in it.... but the cabbage wasn't cut at all... there were huge pieces of it in this thing. Overall, the flavor was off putting (and I like Cajun food), it was greasy, and the whole thing fell apart while trying to eat it. I would not get this again, not when there are 3 other very good choices in the same parking lot (the bbq, the hot dogs, and the grilled cheese).

I (finally) gave Jamburritos another chance this morning after having a yummy sample from them at an event earlier this year. This morning the husband and I shared a chicken jamburrito... it was legit tasty. It had yummy bold flavors, fresh ingredients, juicy chicken, and ...the best part?.... green peas.... yum! It was served with a spicy red sauce and a mild green sauce... the red sauce was delicious, the green sauce was nothing special. The burrito itself was huge, more than enough for the two of us. I would come here again for sure. Glad I gave them another chance!

I went here yesterday for lunch with my mom. This place is very close to her house and she, my brother, niece, and nephew frequent Perk for breakfast. So when we went in, someone (I think the owner?) greeted us and was wearing like a checkered hat and just seemed like a generally nice guy. We were seated in the small, but comfortable dining room. I ended up ordering the napa valley salad to split with my mom and a cup of chicken noodle soup and she got eggs and potatoes. The kitchen actually split the salad into two bowls, which was a really nice touch! The salad was Ah Maze Ing! Soooo good. It has a really creamy feta, wine soaked onions, walnuts, and apples on top of spinach with a creamy balsamic dressing. I could have licked the bowl, this salad was so good. The soup was also tasty, but nothing super special. My mom's rosemary potatoes were really good, with enough seasoning to give them a tasty flavor and her eggs were cooked perfectly. I will definitely come back here again and try one of their wonderful sounding breakfast items (yesterday they had pumpkin pancakes....yum! but in the name of being 'healthy' I skipped them yesterday, and instead ate a bunch of feta cheese (ha!)....*sigh). So go here! You won't be disappointed!

I always go to this OSF with my Gram because it is close to her house and she likes it. I went there yesterday (and have been there on at least 10 other occasions). The food is really just meh. I used to love it as a kid, but now it is really nothing special. The bread comes out warm and with garlic butter, which is probably the best part of the meal. I always get a small order of half mizithra cheese half clam sauce on angel hair (a must at this place for me), and it is fine, but definitely not worth the million calories that are in it. The meals come with soup or salad and ice cream and only cost about 10$ for dinner or 8$ for lunch, so there is no doubt that it is a bargain, but I would not come here if it were not my Gram's favorite place to go.

We went here just for dessert and lattes. The lattes were good, nothing too crazy, but good. For dessert we got the junk food candy bar and it was reeeeeallly good! It was salty and sweet with chocolate, potato chip, pretzels, chocolate mousse, and just all around awesome stuff. I was sad I didn't get to eat here, but it was good. I'll have to try it for lunch or dinner next time.

As promised, I went back to try the food on this trip. Unfortunately, the burgers just didn't live up to the hype and didn't even touch the delicious burger at the Barrymore...not sure why as it is the same company. Anyway, I got the farm burger (or something...the one with the bacon and the egg). There is no reason this should not be delicious. Even when I make burgers at home with bacon and egg on them, they are delicious. This was not delicious. It was so bland and boring. I felt like I was eating a totally plain burger from like Red Robin or something. The BF got the burger sliders and said they were pretty meh. For a 30$ lunch, I would not recommend this place....definite pass....head over to the Barrymore instead.

This place is like eating at a fancy restaurant in buffet form. I loved it! The restaurant, like everything in the Cosmo hotel, is decorated beautifully. You won't find the troughs of fettucini alfredo and Panda Express quality Chinese food here. You get amazing things like a variety of fancy cheeses, gnocchi with ricotta and lamb bolognese sauce, mac and cheese bar (I made a cheddar, goat cheese, asparagus, and caramelized onion mac and cheese and seriously wanted to lick the plate.... oh em gee), shepherd's pie, bone marrow, goat cheese ravioli with lobster broth sauce, truffled potato au gratin, rich soups (potato when I was there) and a wide selection of salad. All of these things were amazing! I also love that everything is in individual containers so the food doesn't mix together. This is genius! There were some misses on the buffet like the Chinese food (wasn't really my thing) and the spaghetti with lamb meatballs was good, but cold. Despite this, I definitely got my 35$s worth with all of the amazing things I had. THEN it was on to dessert. I think the best items were the chocolate lava cake (with coffee ice cream on top, as suggested by a very friendly employee) and the tiramisu in a chocolate cup. The chocolate cake was soooo goood, probably the best dessert I have had at a buffet. They also had HUGE chocolate covered strawberries in 3 different varieties. Of course, some of the desserts were not so hot, but that's the deal with buffets.   I have been to several buffets in Vegas (Rio, Flamingo, Bellagio, Paris, Excalibur, etc)  and this was BY FAR the best. For maybe just a few dollars more, or even the same price, this place gives you much more for the money.

This bar is expensive, with most drinks coming in at 15$... but, as they say, you get what you pay for. The drinks here were fabulous. I had the don't kaffir the reaper (cute name), and it was one of the most delicious drinks I have had in a long time.... lime -y with ginger.... so good. I would recommend it and get it again.

Let me start by saying I LOVED this place...I went here last night with Erin B. and her BF and my BF. I had been wanting to try this place for probably a year now, and I feel so dumb that I waited so long to eat here (I literally worked a mile away from here for like 4 months and live off the same road for the past 2 years....all the missed opportunities!). The four of us had the yin yang broth....it was good, but next time I would just get the spicy broth....it was ridic good. The original broth was tasty, but didn't even touch the spicy as far as flavor. I liked that the broths had different aromatics in them to give the flavor more depth, the broth had big slices of ginger and many other unidentified (to me) but good tasting spices and vegetables in it. We ordered: five spice tofu, 2 orders udon noodles, 2 orders shabu shabu beef, wagyu beef, pea tips, baby bok choy, enoki mushrooms, and corn. The best thing was the pea tips...we all LOVED these! I have never had them before, but it was soooo good, sweet, but not too sweet. They tasted like peas, but in a different shape. The wagyu was delicious, but the shabu shabu beef was also very tasty, both cook very fast (20 seconds or so). The lighter brown sauce is slightly peanutty and compliments the meat perfectly. I really liked the bok choy, but the boys were not fans (Oh well, more for me). I think the only thing most of us weren't huge fans of was the corn. It was just a little more waxy than typical corn, not bad, but not amazing. My favorite part of the meal was towards the end, you can ladle the broth into your bowl and eat it like soup....the broth is spicy and flavorful, the noodles and veg are perfect....this is clearly some high quality stuff.   We spent a long time here eating our food and talking and the bill was only 50$ for the 4 of us. That is pretty standard for a meal for 4, you would spend that at many national chains. I cannot believe people complain about the price... I thought it was cheap for all that we got and the quality of the food, and if you go to the Melting Pot (whose meat, in my opinion, sucks because it is not sliced thin) you pay WAY more money... I'd come here over that restaurant any day. In fact...I want to go back....today......or as soon as possible.   The only problems were: there was only one set up for cooking meat for the table (we probably should have just asked for another, so not really their fault), they didn't explain the process without being asked, and they forgot our noodles and we had to remind them to bring them, but these were very minor flaws. Definitely not significant enough to not go there or even lower their rating.    PS the 4 stars is temporary, if I had the same experience that I had last night again it would definitely be bumped to a 5 star.

Alright! A really good coffee place. So, I went here on my coffee tour of Phoenix (ftw) yesterday with the Bf. He got a hot latte and I got an iced latte. They were both very good. The barista was also very friendly and knowledgeable about coffee. She explained that they have a new espresso machine that uses varying pressures when pulling the espresso shot, which makes for a more smooth coffee. Smooth, it was! Both the iced and hot lattes were not acidic and just had a very pleasant smooth coffee and milk flavor. Also, the foam to latte ratio was very good on the hot version. I will definitely be coming back here.... yum and yum. This may be a new front runner on the coffee tour.

After wandering around the 4th floor of the Cosmo for about an hour and goofing around in the completely empty ballroom area (you know, making casino angels and whatnot), we realized we were on the wrong floor and that secret pizza is really not AS secretly located as I thought it would be.... ANYWAY, we came here twice while in Vegas and it did not disappoint. It was actually much better than some of the expensive places we had. Slices are about 5$ and are quite large. We had a slice of cheese, pepperoni, and white w/ ricotta. The pepperoni was great, they were spicy and flavorful. The cheese was not so great. The white was really good, very garlicky. This place is a great find on the strip! I'd go back for sure.

The husband and I went to Tanzy for the Breakfast Club UYE, and it was lovely! The restaurant is beautiful, very large and decorated nicely. The service was great, attentive, accommodating of our large party and of the husband and I's special requests... it was nice. The husband and I both had the brunch prix fixe, which is a decent deal at 22$ for a mimosa, a side/dessert and an entree. The boca mimosas were delicious.... a mimosa with passion fruit and blood orange juices.... this was a fabulous drink, order it, love it. The husband had the waffle with bacon (and it was a large side of bacon) and he thought it was just ok. I had the eggs benedict and subbed bacon for the ham and it was delicious. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the hollandaise was chipotle flavored (or something) and had wonderful spice, and the bacon was crispy and well seasoned (it had red pepper flake and other seasonings on it). The benedict came with breakfast potatoes (and that didn't count as the side), and they were good... crispy and cooked with peppers and onions... liked that. For my side/dessert I got the red velvet bread pudding and ended up getting it to go (I was so full and had somewhere to be).... even the next day, this was a yummy dessert... maybe not my favorite dessert ever, but good. I would consider coming here again for brunch... but they don't open until 11, which is WAY too late (for me). Maybe lunch? Yes. Anyway, if you're a late riser, check this out!

This place was amazingly BAD. I was so excited to try it based on the owner and his philosophy on pasta, that even the most simple pasta should be the most delicious. Well, the BF and I split the mista salad, the macaroni with polpeta (?) (meatballs really), and a side of polenta. The salad was fine, it was very oniony, but I don't mind that. The pasta was TERRIBLE! It tasted like chef boyardee. Really. It was extremely bland and boring. I found it difficult to eat, it was so bad. The polenta was ok, but it was super rich, but not very flavorful. The meal cost about 40$...the worst 40$ spent in Vegas. Don't waste your time here, go eat at the secret pizza place...it's better.

Went here today with my dad for lunch. The place is very cute and has good service. We sat on the patio and it was a nice day outside. We shared the steak sandwich and the corn and goat cheese flatbread. The sandwich was very good, the steak was tender and it had a lot of flavor. It came with some sweet potato chips that were ok, but not amazing. The flatbread was really tasty, it had corn, goat cheese, bacon, arugula, and red onion... it had tons of flavor. I felt like it was a bit overpriced with lunch costing about 30$, but I would come back again to try dinner or breakfast sometime.

Who knew that Peruvian food was so delicious? Or that it even existed? I am so glad that I finally went to try this kind of food. My friend and I have a deal that whenever we go to dinner we have to try a new type of food. In order to facilitate this, I clicked through every food category on Yelp until I found this place.  So the place is cute and has nice decor. Our waitress was a nice girl, who was helpful in picking out my meal. First she brought out a green salsa, a red salsa, and some kind of corn kernels that were popped... but not popcorn? It was really interesting. They're like the original corn nuts! The green sauce was good, spicy and flavorful, the red sauce was a bit too vinegar -y for my taste. For the main course, I ordered the pollo saltado and my friend ordered the saltado inka. The Pollo saltado is chicken with onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and french fries (?!?!) with some kind of light sauce, and a side of rice. It all worked so well! The flavors were bold and delicious. It was made even better by the fact that it was only 9$. I will definitely be coming back for more of this surprisingly delicious food!

I had the coffee at Royal this weekend and it was just not as good as I remember it from their downtown location. Now...it may be me, maybe I have changed, but I think it was more the skill level of the barista. Not so hot. The coffee was still decent, but I'm hoping it is back to the deliciousness that it was when it was downtown.

I went here for restaurant week with the Bf last friday night. It was really good. We had a really good server who was friendly and efficient.  For our appetizers, the BF got the bacon fat popcorn and thought it was fantastic.... I'm not a huge fan of bacon, but it was ok in my opinion. I got the Mirliton salad, which was delicious! It has such a variety of textures and flavors, it had popcorn, chayote (which I had never had), cheese, cucumber, onion and really tasty dressing. I would definitely order that again. For mains, the BF got the pork tenderloin, which was absolutely delicious! I was so mad that he ordered better than me (like usual). It was the pork with mashed sweet potato, chevre, and figs with apple jus... it was so delicious and full of flavor. I ordered the chicken which I absolutely would not order again (that's where the star came off). It was chicken with a corn risotto and an onion and mushroom hash. It was all kind of smokey.... but not in a good way, and did not have a flavor that I liked. The risotto was not sweet like I thought it would be... and all the flavors kind of blended together so you couldn't taste the components. I make a better risotto at home, so I was very disappointed. Luckily for me, the BF shared some of his pork with me. So for desserts the BF got the pig in the orchard, which is a bacon bread pudding with a cinnamon -y ice cream. This was good, but my dessert beat the pants off of it (woot!!). I got the pot de creme. This was the highlight of the meal! It was amazing... it was a whiskey, coffee, and chocolate pot de creme and it was so rich and delicious.... if I could eat it everyday, I would, and I would be fat and wouldn't care..... So overall, it was good and I would definitely come back HOWEVER I would definitely not order the chicken again.

So I got the Livingsocial deal for six cupcakes from this place a few weeks ago. How could I say no to inexpensive cupcakes? So the BF and I went to get some cupcakes on friday night. I was really sad when we got there and they only had one pancake flavored cupcake left and it had bacon on it. I really wanted one, but i don't like bacon.... so the BF got the pancake with bacon *sigh. We also got a chocolate with chocolate filling, a red velvet, a vanilla cake with chocolate frosting, and, at the suggestion of the guy who works (manages? owns?) there, two malted milk ball. The cupcakes were overall really good. The BF enjoyed the pancake and bacon a lot and said it really tasted like breakfast. I thought the malted milk ball was super good, and I don't like malted milk balls. The red velvet was just ok, the cake was a little dry. The chocolate with chocolate was super tasty..... mmm chocolate awesomeness.   So overall, this place was good. They didn't have the best cupcakes I have ever tasted, but they were solid cupcakes. The service was good and the store was clean. I would go back.

I CANNOT believe I haven't reviewed this place! I went here a few months ago and it was fantastic! A full body massage that seemed to go on forever for such a low price. I could have sat there all day. The people are very friendly and do a wonderful job. This is definitely the nicest foot massage/reflexology place I have been to, would definitely recommend.

So yesterday I had a training right near this little place and I went here....twice.....whoa. I went in the morning and had the nutella mocha....now, I don't even really like mochas that much, but this was a completely different story. It wasn't too sweet, but it was sweet, and it had that nutty and delicious Nutella flavor.....oh my. Thank god I don't live near here or I would be spending a lot of money and calories on this delicious drink. Anyway, I came back for lunch (but they were still serving breakfast). I got their New Mexican breakfast burrito and it was alright, but not as good as many say. I really like the green chili sauce that came with the burrito, but the burrito itself was pretty generic. Anyway, I would like to come back and try their lunch or dinner food and I will definitely be back for a nutella mocha (but not too soon!).

I went here yesterday to get my nails done for my birthday with a friend. We went because we saw the groupon now deal that was 38$ for manicure and 'delux' pedicure. I made an appointment and off we went. When we got there, the man who took our appointment was very friendly and had us pick out our polish and go sit in their massage chairs. So I had Max and he was a very nice (soft spoken) guy. He did a really good job, I learned he used to do some kind of massage and so he is the guy to get if you are coming in, He took his time with me and we chatted about different things, his family and whatnot. Now, as nice as Max was, the guy who did my friend's nails was rude. I don't know his name (no name tag), but seriously, he seemed upset to be there, he criticized her color choice and said "I have to be honest"....but he didn't suggest any other colors or ask my friend if she wanted to switch colors....pretty not cool. Also, he left her nails jagged and she felt like it was a pretty weak service. On top of that, they gave us fliers at the end of the appointment for discounts and they were offering what we had gotten for 30$! and said regular price is 35$! So....the groupon now deal was a scam....it was MORE than what they charge in house (didn't know that cuz they don't have prices listed online as far as I could tell). Now, I'm not terribly mad about that, because I bought the groupon thinking it was fair for the service...but that's not cool on the business's part. Lastly, one of my nails already chipped (and I did not do anything with it)...so I wonder about their product. So Max was awesome....but I don't know that I would go back here.   Update: Just 3-4 days after my manicure I have chips all over the place! I do not do any work that is hard on my hands. What a waste of money. I will NOT be back...sorry guys.

Who knew this place existed.... I mean, I guess everyone does since this place was packed on a Saturday night. I was expecting to have a terrible time here, but was surprised that it was super fun! There were tons of great dancers here and it was fun even to just watch them. The music was mostly country with some pop songs and line dance stuff (so not really what I typically like, but it matched the venue). The drinks were not great, but they were cheap. This is a great place to come out to dance or just watch others dance. I would come back!

The husband and I went here for dinner (after wanting to come here for years...literally since we tried them at the Yelp Pley date...whoa) on Friday night after a not so good happy hour somewhere else. We were pleasantly surprised by their amazing service...they were on top of their game, friendly, helpful, attentive. The place was SO busy! I couldn't believe it. Despite this, we were seated fairly quickly. The food was good, we split a 'personal' pizza and the appetizer meatballs. The meatballs are really good, very juicy, and topped with house made mozz... yummy. The pizza was thinner than I expected, but it was tasty...you know what made it better? Putting some of the meatball on it...so good. Here is the weirdest part....their pizza was even better as leftovers...seriously, microwaved leftovers....it got crunchier and just was awesome...that is a good thing to note since leftover pizza isn't always so good. I would definitely make the trip out here again.

Ummm YUM! Why hadn't I made it out here sooner? This taco shop is legit. The tacos were cheap and delicious. I tried the asada, pastor, and pescado with a shared spicy chicken tamale ... the husband got the carne rolled tacos. All served with a delicious green salsa. I liked everything we ate, but my favorite by far was the fish. This was no ordinary fish taco... it was not fishy at all and was lightly fried so it felt light and airy. The sauce and slaw were wonderful. I'm not a huge fish person, but I would eat about a million of these things... yum. We had all of that and a coke for 11$.... insanity. I will be back!

I can't believe I hadn't given Hey Joe a try before today.... It was very very good! I can pretty much sum it up in two words....pork.....belly. Seriously. My brother and I shared the plate with the pancit and lumpia and....of course...the pork belly. The lumpia was good, crunchy and flavorful, but it was all about the pork belly. It was juicy, crunchy, soft and falling apart, and super flavorful. Also, it only costs 8.50. Pretty amazing deal. I would definitely go back!

Any place that plays Hedwig and the Angry Inch is cool with me. FilmBar is a cute movie theatre that has clearly been made from parts of other theatres. Despite this, the seats are still comfortable and the cup holders are perfect for pint glasses. Additionally, they have some high top tables in the back that are comfortable to watch a movie from (but some of the tables aren't so steady, leading to beer spillage, so be careful!). FilmBar offers a special Mon-Thurs where you can get your ticket, a pint, and a popcorn for 12$.... This is a pretty smoking deal considering their movies cost 9$ just for the ticket. The beer selection is good (about 10 choices) and consists of many local beers and other craft beers. The popcorn is legit, not covered in buttery sludge, just a tasty salty treat. Anyway, I don't know that I would come here just to drink, but would definitely recommend for the movies!  Will be back!

I have been to this stadium a couple times and there are definitely some pros and cons.  Pros: More food options than most spring training stadiums (Crust pizza....yes please!) Nice new facility High capacity for fans More drink options - read: sangria....  Cons:  Have to pay for parking....now I guess this is standard these days, but I think it's wrong. Very busy Long lines High prices (what's new?)   The last time I went to a game here was for my Dad's 60th birthday party. My stepmom rented a party area that was upstairs in the stadium. It was pretty cool, the view of the game was great and we had a private bar. The only thing that is not so cool about having a party there is the huge expense of it. You must buy the water/soda/alcohol from the park and with beers costing 8$ each, that is a huge price. Overall, though, this is a nice place to catch a spring training game.

I am surprised by the mixed reviews of this place! I went here with a friend for happy hour and it was fantastic! We each had a drink- I had their mule, which was very tasty and served ice cold in a copper cup and my friend had the blueberry lemonade drink- this was so good! We also shared the short rib tacos and the calamari. The short rib tacos were fantastic! The meat was tender and it was loaded with veg giving it a very fresh taste. The salsa had just the right amount of heat. The portion size was huge (5 tacos), not only for happy hour, but for anytime. It was a great deal for 5.56$. The calamari was also good, but not nearly as good as the tacos. The calamari was fried and tossed with vegetables in a Thai peanut sauce of sorts. It was tasty, but I don't think I would get it again. Despite this, I will definitely be back for happy hour!

After hiking North Mountain, I wanted to get a light lunch. Thirteen North really delivered. My step mom and I shared their chicken caesar salad with grilled chicken (11$ ish). This salad was giant.... easily enough for the two of us... and was very tasty. The chicken was perfectly cooked, the salad was fairly standard, the croutons were crispy and well seasoned. I would like to come back to try their burgers or mac and cheese or brunch!

I went here last night and it was a pretty fun time. I went with a bunch of friends at around 9 oclock and it was busy all the way until we left at around 1 am. This place is huge! It is in a good location (close to my house) and has plenty of parking. It is a really big bar with a dance floor and a bunch of pool tables. My party of 7 easily got a table, despite it being busy, due to this place being really big. They had a mardi gras party last night that was pretty fun. All the servers were dressed up and they had a free king cake and gave away prizes for people that found the babies in the cake. They had great drink specials, 3$ long islands, hurricanes, and you call its. The first hurricane I got was really good... just enough alcohol to where it still tastes good. The second was terrible.... tasted like cheap rum.... way too much alcohol (and maybe i'm the only person in the world that would complain about that but... yuck). Some people got some food and said it was not so good. They got chicken skewers, queso dip, and an appetizer sampler. I would say that this place is not really a place to eat.... The music was pretty good, a mix of country with line dancing and whatnot and hip hop with regular club like dancing. I thought the place was fun and I would definitely go back.... just not for food.

I have been to Brilliant Bridal twice in my wedding dress search. Both trips were good experiences! The first time I went here, I dropped in without an appointment and all of the girls there were very helpful. They pulled a dress off of one of their window mannequins because 'they had to see it on me.' The dress was a beautiful fitted dress with a one shoulder ruffle. I ended up putting 50$ down on the dress to hold it while I looked elsewhere. I think maybe I got wrapped up in the moment, because I went to a couple other stores and found my perfect dress later that same day (the one I actually ended up buying after a few months of deliberation). So, needless to say, I didn't end up buying the dress, and I have a 50$ credit at the store. I went back after seeing them at the Bridal Expo to make sure there wasn't something else amazing that would trump the dress I had found. I tried on a lot of dresses, and they have a large selection, and the girl who worked there was very helpful and could tell that nothing was going to compare to the other dress. So, sadly, I didn't end up buying a dress here, but I would recommend checking them out, especially if you are on a budget.

I'm not sure why everyone raves about this place...I went with a friend yesterday, and the place was packed! We barely got a parking spot. She had never had pho before, so I wanted to take her to a place that got high reviews so she would have a good experience. The restaurant is very cute, it is in an old house, and is very 'trendy' looking. We were seated and given water and then proceeded to wait for a long period of time before the waiter came around to take our order. When he (finally) did, he was nice enough. We ordered the pork spring roll to share and we each ordered pho ga. I have had fresh rolls before (a lot of them), and this one was just not that great. It was mainly comprised of lettuce, with a little bit of chewy pork bits and a few noodles. Other (more hole in the wall type places...aka authentic) places fill the roll with more of a balance of ingredients. Also, the ends of the fresh roll had very thing rice paper, making it hard to chew and swallow and felt like a piece of rubber in my mouth. Not awesome. So our pho comes out and it looks weird because the broth is clear....almost like water. I have never experienced this before(and I have eaten, and made, a lot of pho). All of the toppings were fresh, but they didn't add enough flavor to save the bland broth. Additionally, the noodles used are thicker, more spaghetti-like noodles than the typical thin rice noodles found in pho. The whole thing was just not flavorful. It felt like the broth was not homemade, and if it was, was missing all of the spices that give it such a unique flavor. To top it off, this place is WAY overpriced. We paid 23$ for lunch, and it wasn't good. I would recommend finding a little whole in the wall pho place in which the employees speak little-to-no English and trying their food. Skip this pretentious 'trendy' spot.

I am SO happy we decided to eat here on our true anniversary (yay seven years!). Honestly, I picked this place because I had a groupon and I thought it would be fine, not as good as the places we went to over the weekend, but fine. I was so wrong. This place blew those other places out of the water.   The place is in the Westin hotel, which is very nice and you have to valet the car, which was very handy and it's validated. The decor is super cute and modern. They have pops of bright colors and out on the patio (where we sat) they have one wall lit with green lights and a nice waterfall type thing. It's all very nice. So the BF got a Manhattan and I got a margarita, both were good. I really liked the salt and pepper rim on the marg, it was something a little different. They brought out a little amuse which was a tempura shrimp... the BF and I generally do not like shrimp, but we both enjoyed this one. It wasn't chewy and the shrimp flavor was understated. The bread was very good and came with a hummus -y spread that was made with white bean and was super tasty.   So we got a bunch of things to share- the butternut squash soup, tomato flat bread, goat cheese tortellini and the cheddar burger. Everything was wonderful! The soup was creamy and had pepitas and some leaves of a brussel sprout in it.... sooo good, just the right amount of texture and it was a bit smokey... really enjoyed it. I think one of the best things was the flat bread. They make their own cheese and the flat bread was AMAZING! The tomatoes were super flavorful and the herbs they put on top (cilantro and green onion I think) make it even better. The roasted eggplant was tasty and the whole thing was a little salty, but in a good way. The tortellini was good, a little different, but good. We got the half order, so it was small, only 3 tortellinis but they were tasty and the greens that came with them were also good. The BF's burger was excellent, he said it was one of the best he's had and I tried it... it was really wonderful. They serve it with homemade ketchup that's almost like a bbq/ketchup mixture with a bit of spice... so good! And the fries were crispy and delicious.   For dessert we got the pear tart on our waitress's recommendation and some coffee. The tart was wonderful! It was buttery, sweet, a little salty, and it had some hazelnut ice cream on it that just added a richness... super tasty. The coffee was also good and they give you a big metal carafe of it, so no waiting for refills....woot! The only thing that could be better is to use real cream for the coffee, not half and half, but that is a rarity. The whole dinner was only around 75$ (with the groupon, 35) so it really is a good deal. If we just got food, without the alcohol, coffee, etc, it would really be a nice affordable dinner, not just a special occasion place.   One of the most impressive things, though, was the all around great service. Our waitress was great, friendly, and made good recommendations. They have a person who mainly fills water and she was on top of it... no running out of water whatsoever. The 3 guys that worked in the front and with the valet were also very friendly and we had a nice chat with them. One of the guys even remembered the BF's name when we came out, which is very impressive, as we were there for about 2 hours. It was very nice that although we were there for 2 hours, it didn't feel like it was a long meal... just nice and leisurely. We will definitely be back.

The food is consistently good at Province. We often go here for breakfast..the steak and eggs is delicious. The steak has chimichuri on it to die for! The benedicts are also very good, their hollandaise has just the right amount of lemon flavor. For a short period they had build your own benedict and that was THE best thing I have had at Province....a benedict on brioche with bacon, avocado, and spinach....it was amazing! They stopped having that special the week after I discovered it....lame. Bring it back Province! Please! Anyway, we went for dinner again the other night and it was very good. Plus the BF and I got engaged here that night so it gets a little extra on its five stars. Hooray province!

I went here for the first time last night after finishing one of my last finals of grad school (woot!) with a big group of friends (20 ish people). We came for happy hour but missed it by like 5 minutes. We were all disappointed, but our waiter pulled some strings and gave us all happy hour pricing on one round of drinks, so that was respectable. They were accommodating for our large party, which was appreciated, but the drinks and the food was very slow to get to our table. I tried the white chocolate russian (good, but not great spin on the white russian) and the tequila sunrise (good, nice tequila to orange ratio). A friend and I split a caesar salad and a pizza with roma tomato, garlic, and pepperoni. The salad was pretty standard, nothing too special, but the pizza was really good. My main complaints with this restaurant include the high prices and the slow service BUT I would come back because the pizza was ridiculously good.    PS Tuesdays are 1$ PBR pint days....awesome!

The BF and I went here the other day while we were riding our bikes around for exercise (yes...I know they kind of cancel each other out....oh well). We each had a latte and shared a blueberry scone. The coffee was good, it had a lot of flavor and the barista clearly knew what she was doing, but the real gem was the scone. This was a PERFECT scone! It was dry (like it should be) and had the right sweetness level. Only complaint...no bike rack! Oh well, we locked 'em up to the fence. We will definitely be back, especially because this place is so close to home.

I can pretty much sum this place up in one word.......mmmmmm.  Ok, not really a word, and, of course, I can't really leave a review at one noise, but seriously....mmmmm. I could eat this food all the time...except then I would be super fat, so I won't, but the point is that I could!  I went here on Monday night for my sister in law's birthday/anniversary party. We had a large group of at least ten people. Our waiter, Rodger, was great! He was very attentive, kept our waters full, and even remembered everyone's order correctly without writing it down...pretty impressive stuff.   I ordered the steak frites, but because we were such a large group, I got to try a bunch of menu items. We started with the fondue (soooo good....I wanted to eat it straight with a fork), the loaded chips (?), also very tasty, and the mini corndogs, good, but not as good as the other two. My steak was delicious, it had an herb butter on top and was cooked perfectly. The fries were crispy and perfect. The BF got the burger with church potatoes. The burger was a pretty standard burger....not something I would come here for specifically, but the church potatoes were pretty good. I tried someone else's ribs.....EXCELLENT! The bbq sauce was spicy and sweet...the meat fell off the bone...this is something I would definitely recommend. I think our table had (possibly) one of each entree and everyone raved about the food. I would definitely come back here again.

I have been here a few times since my previous review for both dinner and breakfast. I will say, I am always satisfied, even though the BF doesn't always love it. When I went for breakfast, I had the matador which was delicious potatoes with chile verde and eggs on a crispy tortilla...it was pretty fantastic. Also, I have had their delicious multi grain salad and their really tasty chicken and corn chowder. Anyway, this place continues to be a satisfying place to eat...no, it's not the best food in town....but I never leave feeling sad that I came.  For your viewing pleasure, my original review: I can pretty much sum this place up in one word.......mmmmmm.  Ok, not really a word, and, of course, I can't really leave a review at one noise, but seriously....mmmmm.

I went here about a month ago and it was not a good experience. I went on a saturday night with a group of about 6 girls. We wanted to get some drinks, but we were unable to because the place was so crowded, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one (don't know how good the drinks may be). In the 20 minutes we were there I was hit in the head with a belt buckle (someone was swinging it.... really?!?!), my foot was stomped on, and a beer was poured on me. Not my kind of place at all. I would never come back, sorry guys.

I went here on Friday night to try something new and because it is SOOO close to my house!!! Unfortunately, it was pretty not good at all. I had the carne asada burrito and the BF had a bean and cheese burrito. I was impressed with the size of the burritos, quite large, but I came to find out that most of the bulk was cabbage. The food was all bland. Even the 'volcano' salsa was weird tasting and not that spicy... My burrito had maybe 6-7 teeny tiny pieces of carne in a sea of undercooked beans, bland rice, and cabbage. I honestly would rather eat Filiberto's than go back here....and I am not a Fili B fan. So if you like essentially eating mushy styrofoam until you are full...this is the place for you!   PS check out Palee's Crown next door if you enjoy flavorful food.

I have been to this Majerle's a couple times and have also been to the one in downtown Phoenix. I will say, I am not a fan. I went with my family earlier this week for my brother's going away dinner. My brothers love this place....not sure why, but they do. We were there during happy hour, so at least the prices were reasonable. One of my brother's got the gorilla wings and I had one....they are sort of bland and nothing too special. I also tried one barbeque wing that I did not care for. My mom got a reuben and said it was one of the worst she has had and that she makes better at home....and my mom is not terribly picky. Their one good quality was that they carry Four Peaks Peach, which I like. This is not a place I would choose to spend my money in again.

Mmmmm Ice cream sandwich. This dessert is really great because it's really two desserts. I like that... a lot. So I went here this afternoon for 'dinner' and got the Vietnamese coffee ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies.... so good. It was a little salty and sweet and coffee -y... what more could I ask for. The BF got peanut butter ice cream with snickerdoodles.... also very very tasty. The thing is, the ice cream wasn't blow your mind awesome and the flavors were pretty ho hum.... I would definitely come back here if I were in the neighborhood, but I probably wouldn't make a special trip again.

I went to Spirit of Yoga for the first time today and I was teetering between a 3 and 4 star. I went with 4 because it's a nice facility, very clean, nice view of a pond (and a strip mall, but I digress...), and the people who worked here were friendly. My class today was free since it was my first class and I was excited to try a wall yoga class (if you haven't heard of wall yoga, and I hadn't, it's yoga using a wall with adjustable straps as your 'prop'). The class was alright.... not exactly what I expected, but ok. The teacher was nice and adjusted us, which I liked, but seemed to be looking up each pose in a book before instructing it... that was a little worry- inducing (since we were hanging off a wall and all...). We used the wall to get a better stretch in each pose, which I liked, but none of it was terribly challenging (it wasn't what I would consider a 'good workout') and it wasn't very 'spiritual' either.... I felt like the yoga was a little lost in this class. Additionally, the straps are very uncomfortable on your (or at least my...) skin... My friend and I both left with red marks/bruises on our wrists from the straps. It was fun to hang upside down, though, and my friend said her back felt a lot better after the class than it had before. I would say my biggest complaint about the class was that it didn't feel like what we were doing would help my general yoga practice (for example, some of the adjustments and poses would not be possible without the wall in the way they were instructed.... I kinda wish that when we were upside down he would have instructed hand placement for if we were to be in a handstand or forearm stand so it would have helped with an off the wall pose... but maybe that's just me) I would like to come back here to try other (non wall) classes and like that they offer free student lead classes several times a week. I'll be back to check that out for sure.

The BF and I tried Habit for lunch today and really liked it. I had a burger with cheese and he had a double burger with cheese meal. I also had a side caesar salad. I really liked that this place puts grilled onions on the burger and the fact that they have a lot of different sides to choose from. My salad was better than expected for a fast food place. I tried a fry and thought it was good, nice and crispy. The burgers were a good size, not so big that I felt sick after eating it, but  filling. I think if I wanted to get a fast food burger again, I would come here over In and Out (I'm not a fan of in and out.... always leaves an oily feel in my mouth). The people who work there were also very friendly, their credit card reader wasn't working, but the lady at the register was still really nice despite looking a bit stressed. Another girl who works there offered to take our tray on her way back to work from her lunch break. Anyway, it was a good place, I want to go back to try their other sandwiches.

I was so surprised by this place.... I hadn't ever even considered coming here because I have been to other Thai basil locations and didn't think it was all that wonderful. So when I found myself let down by the new ramen place next door being closed, I decided to give this place a shot. The food was shockingly good! The husband got the most delish panang curry and I had the spicy noodles, which were ok but not as good as the curry. The prices are a bit high for Thai, but tasty enough to be worth it. He service wasn't wonderful, but it wasn't terrible eithet, just a bit slow. I'll be back!

The husband and I arrived at paradise valley burger fifteen minutes prior to when we were meeting with a group of friends for the 1000 review uye. A few people were here when we arrived and the owner was nice enough to accommodate our large party by pushing several tables together. Speaking of the owner, I was very impressed with his fast response to yelp messages and friendly laid back attitude. As I sit here reviewing, a few people have their food and it looks amazing.  The husband and I are sharing the bacon maple shake (5$) which is sooo super indulgent. It's salty, smoky, sweet and good all over, featuring chunks of real bacon and pecans. I could get fat on these babies. Several in the party ordered the famed brulee burger (8$) (fried egg, bacon, bruleed sugar, pickled onion, and thousand island) with the husband ordering the country fried burger (8$ ish) (a fried patty with gravy and crispy onions), and a variety of sides (i had french toast fries (2.50 ish), husband had sweet pot tots (2$ ish), others had fries). I just received my food which includes a brulee burger add jalapeno and French toast fries... It looks ridic. First bite... French toast fries are legit, not those sorry excuses for french toast sticks they sell at burger king. These are straight up crispy French toast pieces covered in powdered sugar and served with syrup. Sorry diet, maybe tomorrow. The husband's tots are fair, but nothing to write home about. His burger is in that same category, fair. We were kind of expecting something crispy (since the patty and the onions were fried and all), but everything was a little soft... The flavor is ok, but  somewhat one note, certainly not the best order at the table.  Everyone else at the table seems pretty happy with their orders and the staff managed to deliver most of the food at the same time (which is especially impressive since everyone ordered at different times). My burger looks great.... Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving... It is good, but not great.. It's a fast food style patty (thin and cooked well done) and the egg is a little runny, but not excessively. The bacon was really yummy and crispy, but not burnt, so that is a plus. I guess the issue is that it just feels like it's missing something... Maybe a fresh element? I can't quite put my finger on it. Don't get me wrong, the burger is good and I would recommend this place if you were in the area (particularly because of the amazing owner and staff here and their general creativity (new specials every week) which is admirable), but maybe not if it's too far out of your way.  PS Roll me out of here! PPS Thanks to all of my dining companions! PPPS Gorillas love milkshakes PPPPS 1000! Hooray!!!

I love America's Tacos!!!! I go to the one by ASU all the time.... way too much actually. The BF gets jealous when I go without him... that's how good it is. So yesterday when I was shopping with my friend at AZ mills (nine west outlet FTW), I remembered seeing that a location had opened here on FB the other day. So we went to the food court, and there was the America's tacos. This is awesome considering the nastiness that passes for food in most malls. I decided to try something new yesterday, which may have been a bad decision on my part, and got the carne asada torta with extra spicy salsa. I felt like this was not the best thing I have had from this restaurant. I know the salsa was much more mild than it has been at other locations. I think next time I will stick with the tacos, burritos, or vampiros (the tostada of the future....mmmm), although, the place just opened, so there may be some kinks still there to work out. My friend got what I would normally get, a carne asada burrito and an al pastor taco and said it was super delicious. We shared some chips and salsa, again the salsa wasn't really spicy (especially for extra spicy) and the chips were stale! So that was sad. Also, no happy hour or daily specials at this location, at least not yet, and, of course, no alcohol. I am really happy for America and her husband to open another shop, especially in such a good food lacking place like AZ mills.... but I will probably continue going to the ASU location.

I went here to catch up with a friend who just moved here from Seattle. We both really liked this place! I like that they have free music shows sometimes and the food is good (not the best food ever, but good). When we went, they had 5$ Sangria and it was really tasty. I got the carne asada burrito and I liked the flavor, but the meat pieces were a little too small and it was a little too beany BUT I enjoyed it. I would definitely go back.

The BF and I went to Ak Chin this weekend before seeing Rocky Horror over at the Ultra Star. We figured we may as well check out the casino since we were driving all the way out to Maricopa. I liked the casino. I like that it uses Total Rewards, which I have from going to Vegas, and I also like that the slots have a drink menu/ordering system built in, so I never had to sit around waiting for a waitress. The one drink I got was pretty huge and tasty and only cost 6.75. I also ended up winning, so, of course, I liked that. Anyway, I would go back to this casino if I were in the area for sure.

I don't typically give 5 stars on a first visit, but this place was very impressive (and I've had their food at many a food event, so fairly sure it is legit delish). The husband and I went here before getting dinner on our one year anniversary (we were in the area early and decided to drop by). We only had drinks, but the food specials looked great... burgers on special on Fridays, tacos on Thurs... lots of good sounding specials. Anyway, The bartender was nice and helpful. I ended up getting the peach smash, which had bourbon, peach, house made blackberry syrup (made fresh daily), and ginger... this drink was legit... one of the tastiest drinks I've had in awhile. The husband tried a new local beer he hadn't had before, and it was quite good as well. I will definitely be back.

I remember going to Rita's in Philadelphia when I was a kid. I have fond memories of having a mango water ice on a hot day. Well, it's really incredible because this Rita's tastes just the same as I remember! This is the perfect dessert for a really hot day when you want something refreshing. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have custard (apparently they stopped shipping it due to the egg shortage... sad day, but I think they said it would come back in in a month or two). Give it a try!

This was easily the best meal we had in Vegas.   We were very concerned with getting to this restaurant, as some people said you need to drive and we didn't know how far off the strip it was, but we took the deuce to convention center drive and it was a VERY short walk to this place, so no fear there. We came here in the middle of the afternoon and were the only people in the dining area (there were a few people at the bar). The place is super kitschy, with movie reels all over the ceiling and a real funky hipster feel. We started with the matzo ball soup. The veggies were still a bit crisp and tasted very fresh. The matzo balls were a good, firm consistency. The BF got the steakhouse burger. This was one of the best burgers he or I had ever had. Oh mah gawd. It is served on a giant english muffin with bacon jam....He ordered it medium well and it was juicy and amazing. The flavor of this thing was RIDIC! I want one right now and like everyday for the rest of forever. I got the steak frites. Also, incredibly delicious. Kind of different, the steak is served piled high on a piece of toast with some aioli or something and some caramelized onions, parm (?) and arugula. Fries on the side. So tasty. I wanted to lick the plate. We finished with a molten chocolate cake and it was sick. So good. All of this for 50$ and we had a groupon for....50$! It could not be any better. For Reals.    This is a must try in Vegas, I only wish there was one in Phoenix.

I met a friend at Cartel in Scottsdale yesterday. It is smaller than the other two locations, but comfortable. The coffee is the same, good, not my favorite in town, but good. The girl who was working yesterday was awesome, very friendly and we had a nice conversation. The decor has a similar vibe to the downtown location, modern....not as 'cool' as the Tempe location, but nice with a lot of community style tables. I would definitely recommend this shop over some of the other Scottsdale options!

A friend and I ended up at Nami yesterday by some sort of happy accident. Her car was blocked by a delivery truck over at Rice Paper, so we decided to walk over to get a coffee while we waited for the truck to move. I'm very happy we did! This place only serves vegan milks (I think.....no cow's milk, anyway). I was a bit worried that I would not be a fan, as I am not vegan. I ordered a cappuccino with soy milk (their 'base' milk) and my friend had a vanilla latte with rice milk (they said this was closest to 'skim' milk). I didn't try her coffee, but mine was very good! The consistency was right for a cappuccino, the espresso was bold without being bitter or acidic, and the whole thing was very pleasant. While we were there, tons of people came in to get ice cream. Maybe next time I should try some ice cream...it looked tasty. I did have a sample of one of their vegan chocolate baked goods and it was incredible! I was shocked! I have tried lots of vegan baked goods and have not liked them in the least, but this little chocolate nutty baked thing was spot on. There is a definite return trip in my future.

This place has been on my 'to try' list for a long time, but a little part of me always pushed off going here. This changed the other day when hanging with my buddy Dave H. We went here at lunch time. You walk up to the counter, order, and sit down to wait for food delivery. We ordered the hummus, the samosas, and the coconut curry bowl with the house tofu. We quickly had the hummus delivered and then.... crab puffs? Woops. Well, we had discussed the crabpuffs, so we figured they just put in the wrong order. That was ok, we were happy to try them. The crab puffs were good... I don't like regular crab puffs, but the veg version was fairly tasty, creamy, and crispy on the outside. The hummus was very good, a little spicy, but overall tasty... now, it was no Pita Jungle hummus... definitely not at the same caliber, but it was good. I liked the crispy pita chips, but I think it might be better with just normal pita. Anyway, I guess they realized they brought out the wrong item (crab puffs) and they brought us the samosas... woohoo! The samosas were by far the best item I tried there. They were cinnamon -y and delicious... crispy with a wonderful filling. I would come back here just for the samosas...yum. The curry bowl was also good, but I wish it had more sauce.... it wasn't the most flavorful food I've ever had, especially for a curry. I would want to try it again to see if maybe it was just lacking sauce on the day we were there. I will definitely be back here!   PS the decor here is beautiful, very clean and modern.  PPS the prices are affordable- less than 10$ per person

I must be a sucker for wine bars....they are just so good! I went to Timo after finding it on Yelp while hiking North mountain with my step mom Deb. We were hiking and, of course, thinking about food...lol. So we went to Timo, which is this cute little place that is largely hidden from the road by big trees. We sat on the patio for Sunday brunch. The service was great, very attentive and the atmosphere was wonderful....so relaxing. They didn't even treat us badly despite our being dirty and (probably) smelly. We shared the bacon and fig (?) pizza and the rocket salad. The pizza was HUGE and ridiculously good....the pizza was piled with bacon and sweet onions...so flavorful. The salad was also good...it had sort of weird dried raspberries and blueberries on it that were almost like croutons because they were crunchy but had the flavor of the fruit...yum. I would definitely come back here again...maybe next time I'll try the benedict (which also looked pretty fabulous).

I have been to Taste of the Biltmore two years in a row, and both experiences were great. There is an abundance of delicious food from area restaurants - so much food that I just about needed to be rolled out of there. There is valet parking, but I always get there early and self park - you get to come in the back entrance that is far less busy and visit the restaurants in the opposite order of most people making for shorter lines. The decor is lovely with lights strung across the event for 'mood' lighting and many high and low tables to stop at so you can eat your food without spilling all over your fancy clothes. The food consisted of steak, seafood, slow cooked meats, delicious vegetarian food (thanks True Food), and lots of tasty desserts. Drinks consisted of 2 types of Chardonnay, 2 red wines, and 2 beers (IPAs I believe). I would recommend this event to anyone!

I went to this place today for lunch with a friend and I was excited to try it as it uses local ingredients (which is pretty cool). The place did not disappoint. The restaurant is very cutely decorated, which was not expected considering the plaza it is located it, the walls have really modern patterns on them in fun colors. When we walked in, it was a bit awkward because we were supposed to seat ourselves but we didn't know (no sign) so we kind of stood there and the hostess stood there and then finally we were told to seat ourselves. This wasn't a huge deal and will probably improve as the restaurant gets a bit older. For lunch we split the beef tacos and the chicken pita nini with the jalapeno pesto both on the recommendation of our waiter (who was very attentive). We both had water to drink and I liked that they took the time to use cucumber in their water, but garnish the glass with a lemon...a nice little detail. The pita nini was tasty and came with a creamy sauce on the side that was good on it. It wasn't spicy at all like I thought it might be, but it did have a very good flavor. The tacos were very tasty AND huge! There were three tacos that were overflowing with filling. They had pieces of beef, some cabbage, some cotija cheese, pico and avocado. They were marked as spicy on the menu, but I didn't find them very spicy. They were flavorful, however, and the portion can easily be shared between two people. The food was all very fresh which I thought was nice. This place could easily be overlooked, as it is not noticeable from the street or even from within the shopping center unless you are looking for it. Next time I would like to try the jalapeno cilantro hummus and one of the soups, but there will definitely be a next time. Don't miss out on this cute little restaurant!

I went here the other night with the bf and another couple. We had just gotten dinner and wanted some froyo...looked on the Yelp app and found swirl it. The froyo is good, they have several flavors and tons of toppings. I got chocolate, mint, and tart froyo with mini chocolate chips, nutella, strawberries, kiwi, and blueberry. It was really tasty. Everyone was happy with their froyo.   Notable toppings: Mochi, Boba, Nutella  Only complaint: The swirl idea is good, but the flavors next to each other that were 'swirlable' didn't really go together (in my opinion)....like I would put chocolate and peanut butter or something next to each other, but it felt a little random to me.   Tip: They have (or at least they had) a foursquare check-in special - 2$ off 5$ purchase....sweet!  Definitely check this place out if you are in the neighborhood (it's in the Sprouts parking lot on the southeast corner).

I was super impressed with Szechwan Garden! I came here for lunch with a couple coworkers and the place was packed, but we were seated quickly. We ordered the sautéed green beans, the spicy pork lunch special, the chow fun, Xiao long bao, and scallion pancakes. I wanted to come here specifically for XLB, and they did not disappoint. They were a little on the big side, but not too big to eat all in one bite. My only issue with them were that they didn't bring any sauce for them and then kinda disappeared so we couldn't get any..... I think this may have been more of a product of their busy -ness than what is typical. Anyway, the xlb were juicy and delicious. I would come back for that alone. The rest of the food was also tasty, with the green beans being the best item - they were spicy and garlicky and delicious. The chow fun was good, but forgettable, the pork was also tasty. We ate a ton of food and still only paid abut 10$ per person. I will definitely be back!

I went here today with my step mom for some coffee and it was surprisingly excellent! We both got the iced coffee and it was so good, I didn't have to add any milk or cream to drink it.  It was not acidic and was very smooth, with just enough coffee flavor. The feel here is nice, very relaxed. The prices are pretty average. I definitely want to come back and try a latte, but this place has serious 5 star potential!

Man, everyone who is reviewing seems to have only been there for a short period of time. I got there at about 4:15 and left at 10:30. When I got there, there were no lines and I was able to get food immediately from about 4 trucks. Then I was just hanging out with some friends for 30 minutes or so and all of the sudden it was crazy busy. Lines were long. No, it didn't help that people brought a bunch of children and strollers. No, it didn't help that so many people were allowed to buy tickets BUT this only lasted about an hour and a half and there were in and out privileges so why not leave and come back? We ended up just hanging out and enjoying each other's company...which is a fine thing to do! This is a festival.... not a fast food drive through. I waited in maybe 3-4 very long lines, but they moved fast enough and it helped me portion control. So as the night went on, the place seriously cleared out. I was able to get samples from almost all of the trucks without waiting in too many very long lines. ALSO, it was awesome cuz towards the end of the night, both Short Leash and SuperFarm had late night specials! Fried banana with nutella... yes please! So I think that it could have had better planning or a bigger space, but really, it is the first festival, and it wasn't as bad as everyone is saying, plus, this is AZ, I wasn't so horrified by it being in a dirt field.... a grassy park would have been destroyed in a festival like this and I didn't find that dust got in the food cuz each sample was like one bite...maybe that's just me....it's a learning experience, and I'm sure next years will be even better!

This is some seriously good pizza. I had it a couple week ago at food truck friday and it was just delicious. Like going to a fancy shmancy pizza place, but only like 8$....can't beat that! I got the popeye (?), the one with spinach, garlic, tomato, basil, and deliciousness. It was just wonderful...I will definitely be back here...yum!

I went here for brunch with the bRUNch group (a group in which you run a 5k and then get rewarded with brunch and beverages) a few weeks ago. Now, maybe I was really hungry from running, but this was pretty delish. I got the short rib hash and it was done right. The eggs were perfectly runny, the short rib was soft and flavorful, the potatoes were good....I'll be honest, I cleaned my plate. The mimosas were also top notch, as was the service. So why only 4 stars? They don't have any pancakes on their menu....why is this important? The husband is allergic to eggs and so he can't have any egg dishes or french toast, but can tolerate pancakes or biscuits and gravy...I wish this place would add some of those items to the menu so I can come here with him! Anyway, if they did that, I would be a regular.

I went here with a large group last night for a birthday celebration...it was bar #2. We had 8 people there and the people at OHSO were very accommodating for our party. We sat on the patio, which was nice. I actually only had food at this place, so can't comment on the drinks, but I split their bbq burger with the BF and I thought it was really good! Now, it may be because I was drinking, but I ate my half burger so fast it was ridic. This bar has a very relaxed atmosphere and the waiter didn't try to hurry us out, even when the drinking had slowed down. I would definitely go here again!   PS I want to try a beer breakfast....what an awesome idea!

I went here with the BF for breakfast the other day. It is conveniently located at Cityscape. I really liked the breakfast. I had the breakfast grilled cheese with eggs over medium. It was tasty! Eggs, hash browns, cheese, and really tasty crispy bacon on sourdough..... really extra delicious! The BF has biscuits and gravy and it was also very good! It had a roasted red pepper sauce on top of the gravy that was sweet and spicy. I wouldn't say this is the BEST place to get breakfast downtown, but it is very good and fairly inexpensive, so I would definitely come here again.

After coming here for the wonderful elite event, I finally made it back with a friend for happy hour. We got a couple drinks, a couple tacos, the green chili pork with chips, and the huitllacoche quesadilla. The tacos were tasty, but a little dry, and maybe not the most exciting tacos, but good. We were not fans of the quesadilla... not sure if that had to do with neither of us having had huitlacoche before, so I can't hold that against Barrio. The green chili pork made up for any other shortcomings.... this stuff was sooo delicious, savory, maybe slightly spicy, falling apart meat, cheese... it was great. It was even great the next day as leftover after sitting in my car for a couple hours... that's pretty impressive stuff. Prices at hh were reasonable. I'll be back!

Ugh. I know, I know, this is fast food... what do you expect? Answer - at least as good as McDonalds (which this really wasn't... eek!). I went with a class from work, and I will say, the employees were awesome... friendly, patient, and helpful. Additionally, they were having a fundraiser for brain tumor research, which is great. The food, on the other hand, was pretty awful. It reminded me why fast food isn't a good thing. I had a cheeseburger with grilled onions and the thing was a salt bomb.... from the first bite all I could taste was the salt. I should've gotten a hot dog... props for using Vienna Beef! I tried a fry and it was chewy and sad, especially for a shoestring, which is usually awesome. Probably wouldn't come back here, sorry guys!

The BF and I got a midweek treat here this past week and it was pretty delicious. I had a mix of coffee, salted caramel, and snickerdoodle and 2/3 were really good (the snickerdoodle tasted sort of like horchata, but less creamy...it lacked richness). I definitely felt more like I was eating ice cream than froyo (which is good!) and I liked that they had the calorie counts on each flavor. I wish they had more fruit available for toppings, all they had is kiwi and strawberry and maybe some jarred fruit....I think they do have more at times, just not when we went. Anyway, I would go here again the next time I want some froyo.

I was wasting time looking through FB yesterday, when I saw that Aji was giving out free pina colada cupcakes at the Phx public market. That was enough to get me to try their food. I got the gaucho and the bf got the Inca. The gaucho was just ok, in my opinion, it had too much meat. Additionally, the meat was very fatty....however....the sauce was amazing! Unfortunately, all that meat made it difficult to taste the sauce and the onions and all of the good things about the sandwich. I would like that sandwich if it had maybe 2 layers of meat (instead of like....a whole pound of meat or so), but I think I am the only one. Anyway, the reason for the 4 star review was the BF's sandwich. It was soooo good! The sandwich was on a soft roll with just enough crunch on the outside. It had the perfect amount of sauce (unlike mine which needed a lot more sauce). The sandwich was very delicious and full of spice, chicken and french fries. Yes...french fries! Just like getting Peruvian food...but on a sandwich...out of a truck....genius! I would definitely get this sandwich again.   Oh, and if you were wondering.....the cupcake was awesome! They should probably include one with every sandwich....just sayin.

Went here last night for the first time with a group of 6 people for the start of a birthday celebration. This place is probably not the place you want to go with a large group of people, but they were very accommodating for us even though they were very busy. We just had a couple rounds of drinks here. I tried their Manhattan and a couple of their signature drinks...one was fairly good (I just had a sip because it was someone else's drink and then my drink the tongue in something or another...it was strawberry with cranberry and some other things...it was not my fave. Prices were a bit high, but I did enjoy the atmosphere of this bar. I would probably come back.

One time I waited over 3 hours to eat at the Pizzeria Bianco downtown....well, thank god those days are over. This new location is nice because there isn't usually a wait and they have the same menu as the other location....plus it's right by my yoga studio (cuz after yoga, I need some pizza...duh!). I went with my mom and we shared their super simple salad, which was good, but plain with just a light vinaigrette, and we had a half bianco verde half rosa pizza. The pizza was soooo good. Better than I remember from the other location (the lack of the wait time may have helped too). I like that these pizzas are very different than others in Phoenix....local pistachios on a pizza? Come on! Is it the best pizza in town? No...but it's definitely worth a try!   PS this may sound really dumb, but I had some leftovers and later that night I popped them in the micro in the plastic container and the container melted to the pizza...I was pretty devastated, so don't be dumb like me....safety first, use a plate :-P

I can't believe I hadn't been here before! I never went here for breakfast in the past because I was under the impression that they used all tofu products in their food, but this is not the case. They do have tofu products available (like tofu scrambles), but they also have regular breakfast items. I had a really interesting and delicious breakfast, the wild rice pancake. This sounded very odd, which is why I decided to try it. It was a baked pancake with rice, carrots, mushrooms, other veggies, and some whipped sage ricotta cheese....it was so delicious, sweet and savory. It also came with a really tasty side of sauteed veggies. The BF had the baked blueberry pancakes and he liked them very much. Also, the coffee was delicious! Perfectly smooth and flavorful. I will definitely be back!

I will start by saying this place does not have AMAZING sushi BUT they do have good sushi that is cheap, convenient and has a kitschy set up. The BF works right across the street from this place and he has brought the sushi home a couple times. I like that I can have a choice in what I have in my sushi including brown rice and many different veggies that are fairly fresh. I can't speak for the fish, as I don't eat fish, but I have had a roll from here with chicken in it and it was kind of bland...not worth the extra money. Although the sushi is just ok, I like that it is fast and inexpensive and the rolls they give you are large and plenty big enough for a meal. I will be back here for sure.

The Bf and I went to Chloe's yesterday to start off our fall break right (haha). We each only tried the latte. The space is much bigger than I thought it would be, but it is nice looking and they have a lot more food items than I expected. They even have a little mini grocery store area. We walked up to the coffee bar and ordered. The lattes were good, but a little on the weak side. I would come back here if I were shopping at Cityscape (definitely over going to Starbucks), but I probably wouldn't make a special trip just to come here.

I went back to Oink this morning since I was in that neighborhood. I must say, it was much better than last time! They have updated the menu and added some new items. I tried the pork confit benedict. It was pretty delish. The pork was falling apart and had delicious flavor, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was good too. Definite winning dish. The BF got the bacon pancakes again this time, and he said they were also much better. The batter tasted more homemade versus batter from the box. The prices are still a touch high, in my opinion, but I would definitely go back here because the food was very good. Nice job Oink!

After a couple of attempts to come here (too busy...man!) I finally went a couple weeks ago. The food is consistent with the other locations. I had the prosciutto and fig sandwich, it was good, but a bit too much prosciutto for my taste (I like a lighter hand with it, but I can see why they do it that way) and the italian salad, which is fairly good, but not my fave. Would like to get some bruschetta, but will probably frequent the central location now that I am moving out of the East valley. I like their open patio, and the misters help with the heat. I also am a fan of their fresh squeezed 5$ bellinis before 5 pm....very tasty.

The BF went here last night to use a Groupon I bought awhile ago. We were kind of reluctant to enter because we didn't know what door to use and we didn't know if they were open because there was no one in there. At like 7....on a Friday night....eek. We pressed on because we wanted to use the Groupon and figured we would have to come here at some point anyway. Luckily, the food was really good! We shared the pork/black bean/mango pizza and the margherita pizza. The pork pizza was awesome! Sweet and savory at its best and the crust was crunchy and flavorful. Make sure to use the hot peppers that come on the side...that is what really makes the pizza. The margherita was just ok...nothing super special, but a solid pizza. On the recommendation of our waiter, we shared the limoncello cake and it was RIDIC! Sooooo goooood. I don't even love lemon desserts, but I loved this. It was a layered cake with some incredibly light mousse between the cake layers. Served with strawberries and whipped cream....it was excellent. My only problem with the place was there was no drink menu (like specialty cocktail menu), even though I believe there is one next door at the Amsterdam (and I'm pretty sure they share an owner/waiters/kitchen because our waiter was wearing an Amsterdam shirt). When we asked about drinks he just said...well we can make pretty much anything...but I like to try interesting 'signature' drinks. Anyway, this was not that big of a deal. I would definitely come back here, especially because it is so close to my place.

The other day I passed by this place and realized there was a new coffee shop in Tempe. I, of course, needed to try it as a part of my Coffee Tour of Phx! FTW!!! But it wasn't a win...sadly. A friend and I got coffee here tonight. The place is really kind of shady...it looks like it is out of business kinda... Once inside it kind of feels like you are in a creepy person's basement...it's very dark and there is a performance space of sorts in the back. The barista was nice and they have information about the coffee that they use, who is a local roaster, which would be nice if it was any good. I got a latte and my friend got a vanilla latte and it tasted somewhat sour....too bitter and acidic, I drank about 5 sips before giving up on it. I don't think I'll be back....sorry guys!!

I went here on Friday night for my fancy birthday dinner with the BF. There were some definite highs and some lows. Let me start by saying this place was suuuuuper fancy. Like....they import their water in from Wales (I really don't understand that...seems extremely wasteful to me....), they present raw steaks on a special steak presenting thing with mirrors on it....whoa.... Also, they give you an ipad to look at the drink menu...this is kind of dumb because the real menu is not on an ipad, so it didn't really make sense. Anyway, on to the food! They start you out with 4 different types of bread...one more delicious than the next, with butter and volcanic sea salt or something fancy. One of the breads tasted like bacon....yum. I ordered the beef wellington and the BF ordered the short ribs and, at the waiter's recommendation, we got the mac and cheese. Well, the wellington was good, but it wasn't amazing. The beef was great, it was very soft, but the crust just didn't have much flavor. The potato puree was very very tasty and so were the roasted vegetables. The BF's short ribs were good, but not as soft as short ribs usually are. The sauce was very good though. The mac and cheese was too bleu chees -y (despite the waiter telling us you couldn't even taste the bleu cheese). Also, the portions were very large, especially for a fancy restaurant. I'm not sure why the waiter made it seem like we needed a side, we definitely did not. We ended up sending the mac and cheese back....it wasn't bad, but it wasn't to our tastes. We finished with the sticky toffee pudding which was ridiculously good. The caramel was rich and the butter ice cream was crazy good. The presentation was also cute. This place was overall good, but for the price, I didn't think it had enough 'yummyness.' I liked Spago better when I've gone in the past, but this place is definitely an experience and I'd recommend giving it a try.

I am so excited because I am lucky enough to get to have Songbird coffee at my wedding....woohoo! Thanks Jonathon!   This shop is very close to my apartment, walkable for me. The coffee is really good. It is from a local roaster in Tempe. Additionally, the people who work there know a lot about coffee. The guy with the darker hair who works there is very interesting and has worked in the coffee business for several years. The owners are hard working and great at making delicious lattes. Everyone is friendly. Additionally, the decor is super cute and the furniture is comfortable. I have never had a bad experience here.

Let me start by saying this coffee stand/'living room' is adorable. I had been to the Shine trailer a few times in the past, but it took me an exceedingly long time to visit the permanent location of Shine. I went last weekend to take advantage of a special they had advertised, buy a loaf of noble bread, get a free drink. The drinks were good, expensive, but well made. If this location is the same as their trailer, they serve Cartel coffee (not sure if this is the case with this location). The bread was great. The vibe was lovely. I would most definitely come back.

I went to Del Frisco's last night to celebrate Jon and Amy's birthdays. I was really happy with the way they accommodated our large group in the upstairs patio for happy hour. When we first arrived, there weren't enough seats, but as the night went on, we were able to get a couple of large tables next to each other. The waitress did a good job of keeping track of a nonstop flow of orders coming at her (without writing it down, which I normally find somewhat annoying, but is amazing since she pulled it off). The happy hour prices were good, they had many of their signature drinks on special for 5$ and many of their apps on special for 6$. I had the VIP, which is a clementine vodka soaked pineapple concoction, and it was good but a little alcohol -y tasting for my taste (but I know most everyone love them, so don't shy away if you like a strong drink). I also had a margarita, which was just right for me....it is a low cal margarita made with just lime, tequila, and agave nectar...definitely a purist's marg. The BF had a white russian, which was alright, but a bit steep at 9$, especially when it was full of ice. For food we had the roasted tomato flat bread, which was very good....kind of what you would expect from a flatbread...but the tomatoes were big and juicy which I really liked. We also had the frites, which were lackluster and overpriced (IMO) (even if I did have fun with the little ketchup squeeze bottle). Then, overcome with plate envy, we had to order the cheese steak eggrolls. Ohhhhh my. These things were ridic good. They were hot, crunchy, cheesy, they had two different sauces....a spicy sweet sauce and something else magical and delicious. These things were dangerously awesome. I would come back here just for these eggrolls. Anyway, a bunch of people headed out, when they brought out a bunch of cake....how sweet! The cakes were large and damn good too. The coconut cake thing was out of this world...toasted coconut, creamy center, crunchy crust, and about a pound of whipped cream....another item worth coming back for. They also brought out lemon cake which I thought was just ok, but the BF loved it and he is more into lemon cake. Anyway, it was a good time and I would definitely recommend this place for happy hour!

I went here on my way to Hawaii. Here's the deal. This place has awesome breakfast sandwiches. They are way better than anything else you can get in the airport for breakfast at the current time. I had an egg sandwich on pizza crust....it was excellent! I liked that it was cooked by a person in a pan (although I did see all of their 'sauce's coming out of plastic bags for later in the day.....not so awesome, but what can I expect?). The pizza crust made for a tasty spin on this classic sandwich. It also had cheese and tomato. It came with italian home fries, which were delicious! They had garlic and parm on them...Seriously? What more can you ask for...especially in an airport!

The chocolate croissant the husband and I shared was one of the best I have ever had... and we ate it a day after buying it. The chocolate used in it was dark and flavorful in addition to being well spread throughout the pastry. The pastry itself was light and flaky... so good. At around 4$, the price was similar to any bakery. I would definitely get this again.

I went to Rehab tonight to celebrate my last day of work for the school year! Also, we had a yelp deal...so that was cool too. The atmosphere is very casual, that I like. I got a frozen margarita and oh my goodness it was boozy. As I am writing this, I am still tipsy from that single beverage...wow. For dinner I had the hangover burger on a pretzel roll....it was delish! The burger was perfectly cooked and it had egg, cheese, and bacon on it...how could it be bad? It was super delicious. The sweet tots were just ok, but the BF's fries were really tasty. He also liked his turkey club. The service was prompt and friendly by our nice server Pickle. Anyway, I will most definitely be back and next time I will get a pot brownie :-D

This place has 5 star potential, but the service brought it down to 4. A friend and I sat at the bar for happy hour here at what was fated to be a tour of sliders in downtown... but that part of the story comes later. The place was busy, as I imagine it is typically for happy hour. Their happy hour drink menu leaves much to be desired... it only has 4 simple cocktails that don't really show off what this place is all about (elaborate and creative cocktails). We both tried the Tea cocktail that was on special for 6$. It was alright, very strong tea flavor which covered the vodka taste very well... in fact, it didn't taste much like alcohol at all... oh, but it had alcohol. These puppies were strong (haha unintentional pun), and both of us felt it. Here is when the problem arose. We sat at the bar for another 30-40 minutes and couldn't get the attention of any of the bartenders. We tried making eye contact to no avail. We really wanted to order food and I wanted to get another drink. Finally, about 1 minute before happy hour ended we slid in an order of happy hour sliders (heh) and I got a caribe drink of sorts (it had tequila, pineapple, other delish things...). The food and drink got to us quickly, so we were happy. I must say, the sliders were some of the most delicious sliders I have ever tasted... the pork belly was perfectly cooked and not overly fatty, they were delicate and all of the flavors worked together (pork, kimchi, hawaiian roll.... pure bliss). Oh ya, my drink was good too. So my tip is... do come for happy hour, get the snacks, but skip the weak happy hour drink specials and cough up the dough for one of their specialty drinks. I will definitely be back!

Food truck Friday is excellent! There is a large variety of trucks to choose from and the lines are never that long. The only problem with it is that sometimes it's hard to find a place to sit, but that isn't such a big deal. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you haven't yet.

I went to Crepe Bar with a friend earlier this weekend and must say that if I lived in the east valley, this place may be my number one breakfast spot. We shared the breakfast burrito crepe and the vanilla bean crepe with strawberries and walnuts. The breakfast burrito crepe was delicious, it was spicy, salty, bacon -y, and all around awesome. The only thing I think is a little funny is that it doesn't really need the crepe (I know, blasphemy!), The eggs on their own would have bean equally as delicious. The sauces were wonderful as well. The sweet crepe was also very tasty, but definitely did not hold up to the other. It was much smaller than the breakfast burrito, but it had a subtly sweet flavor....it didn't hit you in the face with the sweetness, I think because of the buckwheat crepe maybe. Anyway, I would definitely return for breakfast! So why only 4 stars? The coffee.....the coffee was really acidic and I didn't love it so much....I was glad it was free with my Yelp check in (thanks Yelp!).

Two words....caramel froyo. Ok....here are some more words....it was awesome! Best froyo I have had. The fruit was all fresh and I liked that they had hot fudge. A friend of mine was upset that they didn't have boba, but I don't really mind that. I will definitely be back.

I hope maybe my visit was a sign that this place is turning around a bit. I went to Barrio in the airport on the way to NYC a couple weeks ago. I had the burrito with chicken and goat cheese and all sorts of yummyness inside. I thought it was very good! Very close to the quality of the food at their original restaurant. The service was a bit slow for an airport place, but that means you have to get there a bit earlier. The BF had the pulled pork torta and really enjoyed his food as well. I would say the cons include: expensive, not enough space between tables for a place in an airport...need a little space for luggage etc, and the service is slower than fast casual places (obviously). The pros, however, include: The food is very tasty, the ingredients in my food tasted fresh, they have tasty margaritas, and you're in the airport and not eating at pizza hut.....Hopefully the kinks will get worked out at this location and it can be just as successful as the location on 16th st.

I went here last night with the BF to use a Groupon I had bought. I really had wanted to go to Sens back in the day, but once we moved right across the street from it, they went out of business...sad times. Anyway, this was the first time we made it out to Sochu house. The place reminds me of a club turned restaurant...the decor is very dance club. We sat in the dining room, but the bar looked a bit cooler. At the suggestion of our (awesome) server, we had mostly tapas. We started with the potstickers, which we both thought were just ok. Then we got the orange puffs...very good. Lightly fried chicken with a sweet and spicy orange sauce over some tasty cabbage slaw. We then had the soup dumplings....Oh. Em. Gee. These were awesome! I haven't found dumplings like this anywhere else in Phoenix. They are salty and savory and delicious. So good, we ordered a second plate. We finished up with the red curry. This is supposedly the spiciest thing on the menu, but I didn't find it that spicy. It really was kind of a just okay curry. Could have been a tad bit thicker and had a little more flavor. I would definitely come back, however, for those delicious soup dumplings....I have actually been thinking about them all day. Also, they have some great specials like any 4 tapas for 20$ on Tuesdays and date night specials on Thursdays....Definitely will be back.

I went to Vovomeena with the BF last weekend to have breakfast. The place is cute, small, but not cramped. The style is modern. You come in and order at a counter and then seat yourself, which is nice. I got the Mexican eggs benedict. It was rich and heavy, but had good flavor. It is chorizo on top of a thick corn cake of sorts...then topped with eggs and hollandaise. I think I probably gained at least a pound from this meal. The only problem with the food was the potatoes were somewhat bland. Thankfully, the serving size was huge so I didn't miss having the potatoes.

I went to Davanti last night for the BF's birthday with a party of 5 (including Stephanie B.). I must say, I don't think I have said 'mmmmm' that much at one restaurant in a long time. I had tried Davanti at Devoured (say that 3 times fast). At Devoured they had this porchetta sandwich that was crazy good, so that is what made us go there for the BF's b day. I tried several things last night including:  -Bruschetta of the day- pureed artichoke with pancetta....so delicious, perfectly crunchy bread with creamy deliciousness on top. -Focaccia di recco- This was ridic. This was one of the best things I have tasted in a long time. Crispy crust...soft creamy cheese...honeycomb...this was crazy amazing (thanks Stephanie B for the rec!) -Uovo Raviolo- delicious, but small. It is one medium size raviolo with a whole egg inside. It also has cheese and spinach inside and is covered in brown butter. When you cut the raviolo open the yolk breaks and just adds to the sauce. It was really tasty, but for 10$ it was a little much.  -Burger- I tried the burger and it was very good. Loved the bacon marmalade. Cooked well. -Prosciutto pizza- very tasty pizza that had fresh arugula on it and was pretty delish.  -Funghi pizza- I didn't love this one, it was mushroom and leek and the leek was just a little overpowering.   I also got a hibiscus margatini- this drink was sweet, but not too sweet. It was very tasty. It was expensive, but I would order it again.    This place was very good and it was fun going with a big group so we could try lots of different things (though we totally over ordered and had TONS of leftovers). I would definitely come back here, this place has some serious five star potential. I would like to come at lunch time and get more focaccia and some delish sandwiches....yum!

I want to come back here. Immediately. Right now. I just had it for lunch. This place was surprisingly awesome. Did I mention I want to come back? Well, anyway, upon entering the restaurant, I was a little worried. This place is small... aaand not so squeaky clean.... aaand kind of on the old side, BUT do not be deterred. The food was legit. More legit than anywhere else I have had in Phoenix. The lunch special was a steal at 6.50$ and coming with soup, entree, spring roll, fried crispy wonton things, and rice (if you don't have noodles). The soup was delicious, a slightly spicy lemongrass flavored soup with fresh veg inside. For my entree, I had the drunken noodles and they were the most flavorful drunken noodles I have had in town. I often complain that my noodles are too dry, not so here. The noodles had tons of fresh veggies (broccoli, onion, carrots, basil, bell peppers, etc) that were cooked perfectly. I would go back for that dish, but I also would like to try their curry... it looks great. This place has serious five star potential. Will be making a return appearance soon!   PS Like others have mentioned, seating is limited, so we had to wait a bit for a table, but the wait was totally worth it.

I went to the Daily Dose today for breakfast and honestly didn't think much of it. I got the egg sandwich on a bagel and it was one of the most boring least delicious egg sandwiches I have ever had. Anyone who knows me knows that I LOVE a good egg sandwich. I think a good egg sandwich is simple and lets the ingredients speak for themselves. This was not like that. It was on a bagel, which I thought was too much bread for a good bread to filling ratio, it had cold mealy tomatoes on it. The tomatoes made the entire dish cold quickly. I took them off. Overall, this sandwich was just not what I like in an egg sandwich...maybe others will like it, but I just didn't think it had that simple deliciousness that I expect in an egg sandwich. Also, the sandwich came with some potatoes that were pretty standard and some fruit that was just ok. The BF got the pb&j waffle. This was good, but also on the cold side. The PB was on top, but wasn't melty like you would want on top of a waffle. The waffle was a bit soggy, and though it did taste like a pb&j sandwich I'm not sure why you would pay 10$ to have something that tastes like a 1$ or less sandwich you can make at home. Our bill was 30$....there is no way this food is worth that much money. I will say, the service was good and the manager came by a couple times, so that was nice. Despite the good service, the mediocre food and high prices combined with the wealth of good breakfast places in the downtown and midtown areas will keep me from returning to Daily Dose.

Thanks to Yelp again for allowing me to try a delicious restaurant that I would have never found otherwise. This place was the perfect cure for the night after a long Vegas night.The decor is so cute and modern....very hipster in a good way. I had the oddest breakfast...the huevos with red and green chili served over black beans, peas, tortillas and....feta and....banana?!?!?! It sounds so weird, but it was exceedingly delicious. Sweet, spicy, and savory...perfect food. The BF got the pancakes, which were delicious, but was too hungover to eat them (!), he took about 6 bites and then I insisted we take the pancakes back home all the way to AZ...and they were still good! The coffee was also good....it just was overall awesome. I will definitely be back!

This place is pretty awesome. If my future experiences are anything like my experience last night, this place would be a definite five star. I went with the BF and a couple of friends and we were seated right away (around 9 ish). The bar was hopping. Our server knew a lot about beer and we each gave him a description of what we liked and he picked beer for us. It was awesome! He clearly likes his job and is very good at it. They also have a neat way of doing flights, they have a piece of paper with 6 circles on it. You put the number of the beer you want to try in each circle (and there are like 30+ choices.....ah mazing!). They bring out the six fairly large sample sizes in a muffin tin (cute idea!). We got two flights and tried some crazy beers...a lot of beers none of us had ever tried before. It was also cool that the beers were changing throughout the night...like when one keg ran out, they replaced it with something totally new. We didn't have any food, but it smelled and looked good. The ambiance is comfortable...they have an open wall out to the outside and tables throughout. It is a large bar and has plenty of seating. I will definitely be back!

Really? Is this really the 'best buffet in Vegas?' This place was a huge huge huge disappointment. The first time I came here, I waited an hour in line and then ended up leaving when I found out the line was another 2 hours...ugh. This past time, I was happy to see that you could get a slip of paper with a time to come back so you could go do other things for awhile and come back. Great idea! We came back 90 min later... only to find out that there were 2 more lines to wait in. Seriously?!?! Why even have the paper? Just call me when you are actually ready. We waited another 45 min or so to pay ( a ridic 65$ ish with a prepaid tip) and be seated. Why? They kept letting people ahead who paid to skip the line. That is ridiculous and infuriating. Anyway, when we finally got in, we were overwhelmed by the amount of food there. It was a ton. Unfortunately, pretty much none of it was good. There was one dumpling I got that was good, but upon returning, they didn't have anymore. Tried to ask of they had more and the man behind the counter claimed a different dumpling was it (not the case, clearly...one was shrimp one was pork). The pastas were all disappointing...flavorless..boring. The pho was ok, but the ramen was gross. The lamb chops were way underdone...super red...ew. Poor lambs. The seafood was overly fishy...not too fresh. The Mexican food was awful... my friend actually spit it out. The only good items were the mac and cheese, the cheese (duh), and the yellow curry. The desserts were a joke...flavorless again. The service was awful. We never got a refill on our drinks. Plates sat on our table ready to be cleared for a long time. I would never go back here and never recommend.

The BF and I had LuLu's for the first time tonight and it was really delicious! We shared a cup of the coconut and it was wonderful. It was creamy, cold, refreshing, and just the right amount of sweetness. The texture is really nice....not icy like a snow cone, but not overly creamy either. I will definitely get this again!

Don't see this show....it is SO boring. I literally was dozing throughout the entire show. We got our tickets from a ridiculous time share presentation (were promised Ka and got bated and switched to this POS), so at least we didn't pay for it, but this show was just boring, had no discernable plot (maybe an angry fetus? not sure), had no impressive acrobatics...just don't waste your time and money.

I went to this restaurant last night as part of the BF and I's V day date exchange. This restaurant had some extreme highs and some middling points.   The highs:  -House made cinnamon whiskey and the whiskey apple.....I don't even like whiskey and I love this! -Our waiter, Tommy, was awesome, helpful, and honest -Brisket biscuit..... tiny, but packed a lot of flavor, the meat was tender and the sauce was tangy...just delicious. -Broccoli carbonara....not healthy in the least.... so delicious, creamy and cheesy sauce over perfectly cooked broccoli.  -Apple caramel upside down cake - this cake is phenomenal.... the perfect amount of sweetness and the pairing of the pistachio ice cream is just wonderful.  -Popcorn grits....extremely tasty, Definitely will get this as a side next time (got it with the pork this time).    The Middling points:   -We were seated right next to the door to the restaurant on the patio, which was ok....but it was a very high traffic area next to the waiting area/lounge thing and it was cold out and this particular table was not near a heater or a fire....not awesome. (and yes, we made reservations a week ahead of time) - The pork entree was pretty mediocre....pork should be extremely delicious, but this pork was just lacking flavor. The portion size was big, but that doesn't matter if it's not something you really would like to eat.  -The goodnight kiss drink was just alright....it had chantilly cream in it, which sounded amazing, but in reality made the drink just a bit too thick and heavy to be very enjoyable.    Overall, the night was nice, the food was good, and I would definitely return, but next time I might stick with sides, apps, drinks, and desserts (with an emphasis on dessert...yum).

After going to the Central Bistro for the elite event earlier this week, I decided to give them a try today for brunch. I was a little leery of going because they don't have their brunch menu posted on their website and the BF is allergic to eggs, so I always like to check out menus before going, but we decided to go for it anyway.  Let me say, their menu is great! They had over 5 options for him to eat that were not egg based (pancakes, waffles, oatmeal, etc). They also have a variety of egg items that all look delicious. After being seated, the waiter brought water and a tray of sliced citrus so you can pick your own flavoring for the water...very fancy. We started with donuts and coffee (we had a free coup from our goodie bag) and this was the most delicious part of the whole meal. The donuts reminded me of little zeppoles in a delicious orange cream sauce....so good! The coffee was french pressed and also wonderful. For entrees, I got the truffle egg sandwich (a fried egg, tomato, bacon, spinach, and a truffle aioli I had put on the side on an english muffin) and the BF had the pancakes. The sandwich was good, but I wish they used an over medium egg versus an over hard egg, but I could specify that next time now that I know. The pancakes were alright, but nothing super special until we put some of that orange sauce from the donuts onto the pancakes and then they were delicious! Also, the service here was amazing. Our waiter, I think his name was John but not sure (sorry, I'm bad with names!), was attentive, gave good recommendations and seemed like a down to earth kind of guy, which I really appreciated. The bill was reasonable as well. Although I wouldn't say this is the best breakfast in town, it was a solid choice and I would definitely come back here for brunch again!

I only got one thing here while at the airport this past Christmas......the red velvet cupcake. And it was sooooo goood. Decadent. Cream cheesy. Fantasticness. I want another red velvet cupcake right now *drool. The place is set up very much like LGO in Phoenix. They have a lot of really good looking food in the small market and they also have burgers, pizzas, and sandwiches that all look amazing. This is a definite must stop while in the airport!

Ok, so on my way to Hawaii a couple weeks ago, the BF and I stopped at LGO to get breakfast before our flight....now, this was a big commitment because it is on the complete opposite side of the airport as where our gate was so it then required us to make a lap around terminal 4 (which is pretty huge). Anyway, I got the commuter sandwich after all of the hubbub about how awesome it was from everyone....it was not good! The eggs appeared to be the same microwaved eggs you get at Einstein's and the sandwich had little to no flavor....The bacon was sad and flaccid. Luckily, I also got a red velvet cupcake again which allowed this  establishment to remain a 4 star place just for the sheer glory of that cupcake, but come on people! There needs to be some quality control or something, because that sandwich was just sad.

I've passed by zookz many many times, but, for whatever reason, I never went in. After the shop moved to its new location, I finally decided to give it a shot. The new location is super cute...I love the color scheme. I went for breakfast and had their sandwich with eggs, spicy cream cheese, bacon, and green onion add basil. I really enjoyed the sandwich except the fact that they can't control the cook on the eggs resulting in overcooked egg yolks. Who wants that? Anyway, the crust and the rest of the ingredients were delish and the prices were inexpensive. I would definitely return!

Who knew there were so many cute places in downtown Mesa? This brewery doesn't look like much, but boasts some solid beers. They had three (3!) hefs on draught... how cool is that? I had a dunkel (I think?) and it was very tasty, served in a ridiculously tall glass. If you are in the neighborhood, check this place out!

This place redeemed itself! I went here with my family for my birthday a few weeks ago (why go to a 3 star place for your birthday....I don't know, convenience?). Anyway, I got to try many more items due to going with a large party (PS they were very accommodating to our group and allowed us to bring a cake in from outside) and I must say it was much better. We started with a caprese salad and meatball apps. The meatballs were delicious, covered in a red sauce and served on top of crispy polenta I believe...it was yummy. The caprese was ok, nothing wonderful, but not bad. I got to try the Brussels  sprout pizza, which was awesome but not as good as the one from La Bocca. The real winner, in my opinion, was the pizza with the italian sausage and goat cheese...can't remember the name, but it was extremely delicious. It still is missing the fifth star for me from the first experience and the fact that the service was a bit slow, we ordered coffee and it came out kind of cold (which they fixed and were very nice about), and some of the pastas/sandwiches were not as good as others, but I will definitely come back here for that sausage pizza again!

My review of this restaurant may not be wholly accurate of the general experience one night have at Gojo as I went with a large group and we had our own buffet that we each paid 20$ for. Regardless, I got to try many different dishes (I'm sure I wouldn't have had the variety with a smaller group), and they all were so good! We had a chicken dish, a lamb dish, yellow lentils, Brown lentils, potatoes, spicy greens, etc etc... Not a single bite was bad! The injera bread was perfect for eating all the different dishes. I would love to return to experience Gojo as a small group and plan to in the near future!

I just went here tonight and I do not know why I haven't been here before! The place was really inventive with the fillings for the enchiladas. They had corn bread and mashed potatoes and short rib and all kinds of deliciousness. I got enchiladas like I've never had before. Short rib and mashed potato with christmas style sauce (red and greed), a fried egg, slaw, pico, cheese, ohhh my, it was delicious. Also got the guac, which was wonderful! I got two enchiladas and still have plenty left for lunch tomorrow. I will definitely be back!! (I had a taste of the cornbread...and I need more!)

I have been here twice and I am not sure if I will be back for a third. The idea is great, it's nice to have the option to play games and whatnot, but the place is just too busy...maybe they should let less people in? not sure. The valet is a bit of a nightmare, as it gets backed up and you wait for a very long time, at times. I went for happy hour once and it was very hard to get a spot in the bar area (the only area that honors happy hour pricing), but after waiting awhile, we got a spot. All of the food we got consisted of bread and cheese and were fine, but how bad can bread and cheese be? I thought the grilled cheese sliders would have bacon or whatever they do on the regular menu, but not so at happy hour...sigh. I also went to a fellow yelper's birthday party here and it was a bit crazy... not as much seating as they had given us in the reservation, no possible way to get food (not enough room), extremely slow service....took over 25 min to get my credit card back and my husband had to go find the waitress for this to happen...thought maybe they lost the card...yikes. It was just nothing special.

What a cute festival! I have been to the Local First Fall Fest the last 3 years, and each year has been fun. The first year I went, the food samples were free, which was ridiculously awesome... now, obviously that didn't last... but at 1$ per sample, you can get pretty full for a decent price. This year I dined on delicious pumpkin soup from St Francis, a yummy taco from Joyride, an ice cream sandwich from Churn, amazing salted caramel pudding from Arrogant Butcher, and treats from LGO (amongst many other things... I was so full). There were many cute items for sale, I scored an adorable necklace. The festival isn't overly large and isn't a full day activity by any means, but that's ok. Overall, I think this is a fun free (entry anyway) activity that's worth going to year after year.

I really really really hate to do this, especially when I went here with the breakfast club.....but it really was disappointing (ahhh I'm sorry!...just must be honest). We went last weekend and we did have a large party and the place was busy so I will give them that. The coffee was great, it was strong and tasty. I ended up ordering the 'poached eggs' or what most people know as a bene and the BF got the pancakes. My bene had overdone eggs...the yolks weren't runny at all....you cut into them and they just stayed where they are...wah wah. The whole thing was just ok, but nothing I would go back for. I didn't even finish it (which is unheard of for me with benes...). I had it with bacon, and the bacon was alright, but not as crunchy as I like. The BF thought his pancakes were heavy and lacking in flavor. Aaaanyway, we did have a great time here, but the food just didn't live up to my expectations and the price was high considering it wasn't that good (we ended up paying about 35$ after tip and all.....yikes!).

I first discovered Aloha Cakes at the Western Adventure...thanks Yelp! The cake was so delicious at the event that I knew I had to order one for the BF's birthday. Working with the people at Aloha was a pleasure. Nenita was very sweet. They delivered the cake to my downtown Phoenix apt on a Saturday for free....it was awesome! The lady who delivered the cake was also so nice. They even made a cute happy birthday flag for me to put in the cake. Well, I ordered the haupia cake and it was sooooo good. It was light and coconut -y. Perfect for the BF's birthday. The cake was even better the second day than it was the first. I will definitely use Aloha Cakes again in the future and recommend that you all take advantage of this delicious cake gem in the valley!

This place is a bit baffling. I have been twice so far, one time was not good at all and the next time was excellent! I think I may have ordered the wrong thing on my first go (and that's why I gave it a second go and held off on reviewing). The first time I got the mango tango (or soemthing like that)...which was mango snoh with mango 'pudding,' mango jelly or something and some kind of caramel sauce I think.... it was really weird. Kind of tasted chemically....I think it was the sauce or the pudding (which was more like congealed substance than pudding). I left very sad. Anyway, the next time I went, I got thai tea snoh with nutella sauce and almond cookie...this was so ridiculously good. The Thai tea snoh had a great flavor...really captured the essence of the tea...the cookie gave it a good crunch and the sauce was nutella so it is pretty much required to be delicious. I will definitely be back again and recommend it....just order wisely my friends.

Really Yelpers? I was super disappointed with AZ Donut co. Yes I went at about 9:30 pm, so maybe that affected the deliciousness of these donuts, but overall there was very little deliciousness to be had. I tried the banana cream donut and it was weird... artificial... in flavor, greasy, and unpleasant. My friend also had a donut and said it wasn't even as good as Dunkin. I had coffee, which was nothing special. I would not return, there are better donut establishments in town.

I went to the Tequila Festival with the BF and 2 friends and, honestly, it was pretty fantastic. We got our tickets through groupon, so it was not terribly expensive. With the ticket, you get 10 drink samples. I tried drinks from Canteen, Cruz tequila, and many others. We got enough alcohol to have a very good time. We also got to try food from the Sandbar (spicy mac and cheese...surprisingly delicious), El Reye de la Torta (always delish), Si Senor (Really good green chile...strong jalapeno flavor, but yummy), and America's Taco Shop (delish pork tacos). I had the added bonus of getting some Yelp sunglasses....fabulous! Overall, we had several hours of fun and entertainment and didn't have to stand in line for crazy amounts of time to do so. We also got to meet Xhibit...so that was....weird. I would go again next year.

Let me preface this review by saying that I have had Tammie Coe cakes at the Roosevelt location several times, but this was my first experience with the location on Central. I special ordered a lime/coconut/sour cream cake for mother's day. I had a slice of this cake on Valentine's day and it was one of the most delicious cakes I have ever had! This cake was no different, very delicious. So why not 5 stars? When I got there, there was a nice man in front of us also waiting for his special order cake. Unfortunately, he was not as lucky as I was. Apparently, they are not terribly organized and for a cake to be made it has to be on a clipboard and this poor guy's cake ended up in a black folder or something and didn't get made. He had paid for it in advance. The girl who works there did not know what to do and gave him a different cake, but not what he had ordered. The girl who worked there told me that they were not organized and things like that happened often. Well.....that is unacceptable. If that were me I would be extremely upset and I just don't think that things like that warrant a 5 star review (even though the cakes are amazing). I hope the people in charge of this bakery did something for this man and will do something for anyone who counts on them to provide a cake for their special occasion and they fall short.

Why did I come here? Oh ya, a 5$ coupon in the mail. This place is not awesome. The food is all flavorless... so bland and so salty. It was nice that they give you bean dip, but the bean dip was also bland and nothing exciting. I just had a cheese crisp...pretty safe... but it had absolutely no flavor. It's like they just open cans and serve. Although this was marginally better than Manuel's, it still isn't a place I will come to again.

Sky Harbor has upped their food game. Cowboy Ciao offers the perfect on airplane meal - chopped salad! I got the  chopped salad (which, I have to say is very expensive, more than at the real restaurant I think.... 14$), and took it on my looong flight to Boston. Halfway through the flight, I had the pleasure of eating this delicious mix of textures, flavors, and temperatures. I would recommend this if you  are hungry at the airport.

I went to this salon twice in the past two days (craziness, I know). I went yesterday for a mani pedi with the Groupon deal and today for waxing. The salon is very cute and modern, with local art hanging on the walls....very inviting. Let me start with the waxing *this part should be skipped by family members* I was waxed by D'Lisa who is the owner of the salon and she was really great. She was personable and really knew what she was doing. We chatted about different topics and she kept my mind off of the waxing, which could have been very awkward (but wasn't). She did the whole job in less than 20 minutes, I was thoroughly impressed. Also, the waxing room feels a little more comfortable than others I have been in....it was still clean without having that doctor's office feel, so I like that.   *Ok family members, you can come back now* So yesterday I came in for a mani pedi and I will say there were some high and low points.   High Points: the job is nice and hasn't chipped yet, the color selection was good, and the nail tech was fairly personable.  Low points: The nail tech ran about 20 minutes late for my appointment (now, I understand that they have been really busy due to the Groupon, but that is a significant amount of lateness), everyone in the salon that day was complaining about the Groupon (again, I understand that there were issues with Groupon, but as a customer coming in with a Groupon it made me feel a little awkward...also, the owner wasn't in yesterday, so the stylists and techs may have felt more comfortable complaining to each other...I thought it was a little unprofessional), my nail tech happened to complain to me about other customers or otherwise talk about other customers after they had left (again, somewhat unprofessional...makes the customer think, what will she say about me when I leave?), and, finally, the pedicure stations aren't what I expect when I go in for a pedicure.... it is a long bench up on a platform with large removable bowls on the platform. This looks cool, but functionally isn't awesome. The tech filled the bowl with warm water from the hair washing station, but due to the length of time a pedicure takes, the water got cold quickly and was no longer comfortable. Also, the bowl was just a regular bowl, not like most mani/pedi places that have massaging pedicure chairs/bowls. Then, to complete the services, the client puts their feet on the half lid to the bowl that is a little too short for the nail tech to do all of the service, so she had to have my foot on her leg at times.....it just seems like an awkward set up for everyone involved. I know D'Lisa told me she reads these reviews and takes them seriously, so I would suggest thinking about the set up for pedicures to try to make it more functional.   Anyway, I would consider coming back here for a manicure and I would definitely come here for waxing, but I probably wouldn't return for a pedicure.

What a fun place! From the outside, Spokes looks like a big 'box' restaurant... you know... like Cheesecake Factory or something. But inside, it has a lot more unique character. A friend and I came for happy hour, at which they have a dollar off pints amongst other food/drink specials. They have many beers on top of all varieties. Our waiter was knowledgeable about the beer and helped us choose one we would like. I didn't get to try the food, but it sounded like typical bar food. I would return!

The BF and I rode our bikes here today and we were thoroughly impressed. This place is close to my apartment and fairly convenient. The inside is cute, pretty modern looking. The girl who was working there was friendly and explained all of the drinks to us without making us feel like we were putting her out. I was just going to get toddy, but ended up getting a specialty drink. I got the almond joy (coconut mocha) and the BF got the Charlie Chaplin (white and dark chocolate mocha) both with nonfat milk to make them healthy (lol!). We both thoroughly enjoyed our coffees. Mine still had a strong coffee flavor and was not overwhelmed by the sweetness of the other flavors, it was soooo delicious...still thinking about it now.... I can only imagine how good it would be with whole milk. Anyway, this place has serious 5 star potential, but I need to make a second visit to determine that. Hooray GreaterThan Coffee!

I have mixed feelings about Halo... On one hand, I got my puppy here and he is a good dog, but on the other, our actual experience was not very good. We went one day to look at dogs with the thought that we might adopt. They have a lot of dogs here and the conditions aren't wonderful. A lot of the dogs are in indoor/outdoor cages that were very dirty when we went. The dogs kept indoors were 3-4 per cage. We filled out the paperwork to meet some of the dogs we had seen and handed them to the man at the counter. Then we preceded to wait....and wait....and wait. Not wanting to be impatient, I finally went up to ask how much longer it would be. Oh, they lost my paperwork. Great. We refilled out the paperwork and finally got taken back to see the dogs. The people who work/volunteer here weren't very knowledgeable, but helped as much as they could. We found a dog that would be a good match and his adoption fee was 185$... a lot more than the Humane Society. I understand, but it seemed a little steep. We took our pup home and fed him the food they sent home with us. He wouldn't eat. He wouldn't eat for a week. We thought maybe it was an adjustment period. That is until we fed him a different food and he ate it all. How long had he been at the shelter refusing to eat? I know he had been there at least a week. That just made me sad. Additionally, unlike the Humane Society, Halo does not include a vet visit with adoption, so that is unfortunate, as many animals do have initial medical needs. I don't know that I would adopt here again, but I did get a good pup and am thankful for finding him.   PS The dog was listed as black and white and indeed looked that way....that is until we washed him and he turned out to be brown and white.... would've been nice if they rinsed these poor dogs off. Just a thought.

I went here with my dad for lunch out on the patio. The things that were good were insanely delicious, but the rest were fairly mediocre. We split the guac, the pig wings, and two tacos - short rib and carne asada with the house rice. This was plenty of food. The guac was one of the mediocre items. It had a weird artificial lime flavor... like a cleanser almost. Also, they used pepper in it, which is just plain weird. It was not wonderful. The pig wings were one of the insanely delicious items. They were sooo good! Like the most tender barbeque pork rib with a wonderful glaze.... it, in itself, is worth a return visit. The carne asada taco was one of the mediocre items. It was dry, kind of bland, and nothing I would order again. The short rib tacos were incredible! The short rib was moist, tender, full of flavor. I would get this item again. The house rice was also very good, it is rice with chorizo and pineapple in it.... that is fabulous! I would love to come back here for these few memorable items and to try some new items as well.    PS the prices are very reasonable, we were stuffed for under 20$

I went to CASA with a friend on Friday to get a couple drinks. We had tried to go here a few weeks back, but the place was way too packed. On this night, we were able to sit up at the bar under a heater, which was perfect. This place has a surprisingly nice cocktail menu, with many imaginative options. I had their take on a Moscow mule, the light and stormy. It was fairly tasty, but not fantastic. My friend had their take on a white Russian... and this thing was fabulous! It was a white Russian with rumchata in it and cinnamon on the top.... so good! They also have a wide variety of beers on tap. My friend was talking about one of the beers and before I could tell her to ask for a taster, she had one... now that's good service. I'd like to come back to try some of their interesting food options (mac and cheese burrito... oh ya!).

The husband and I went to Salty Sow for happy hour a couple days ago and it was overall very good. I had been to the Yelp elite event here earlier this year and liked it very much, unfortunately, this place is nowhere near where I live so I hadn't been back. Aaanyway, the specials for happy hour include 5$ apps and 2$ off wine and cocktails. I had the sangria (very good, somewhat sweet but not too sweet) and the drink with the ruby red deep eddy vodka.... I forgot what it was called, but it was herbacious and tasty. We split the fried chicken app with the biscuit... the biscuit was delicious, but the chicken was a little on the sweet side. It was good overall, but I don't know that I would order again. We also shared the budino, which was so good at the elite event. It was still very delicious, but tasted like it wasn't made that day... it was a little liquidy on the bottom and the whipped cream wasn't as soft as it normally is... pretty sure it had been made the day before or a couple days before that. As I said, it still tasted good. I would definitely come back if I were in the area, especially for happy hour.    PS - the one bummer of hh (and the whole menu, actually) is that the majority of their food come with an egg on it (which I love, but the husband is allergic to eggs so it limits his options, and I know that they would probably leave the egg off if requested, but it takes away some of the intended flavor/texture of the dish).  PPS - They have all day happy hour on Mon and tues... nice!

I have been meaning to try this place for ages, so after driving by so many nights, last night we decided to stop. The husband and I shared a burger and a chocolate shake. The burger was legit... very large, juicy, and flavorful like a burger should be (not a fancy type burger.... a casual type burger). It comes with two patties (why no one patty option?), cheese, lettuce, tomato, 'secret sauce' served on a buttery bun. It was definitely good for a drive through burger. I think it would be made much better if I got my own burger and added jalapeños and grilled onions (which the husband doesn't like), but I'll find out next time. The shake was also decent (I don't love shakes)... it tasted like straight up chocolate ice cream, which isn't a bad thing. The service was fast and personable. If I were craving a drive through burger again, forget In and Out, I'd stop here.

I have had a love/hate relationship with Matt's, but in the past couple of months since they changed locations it has definitely been on the love side! I have gone to the new location a couple times and I think I have figured out the 'secret' to eating here. I live about 3 blocks away from Matt's so when I want to go I get up super early and arrive no later than 7:30. This generally ensures that I do not have to wait. Then, I order either the griddle cakes or the waffle, with the waffle being the better choice. The waffle is light, yet obviously bad for you because it tastes sooo good. Unlike the griddle cakes, the portion isn't crazy over the top and it comes with bacon which I like to tear into small pieces and put a piece in each of the little waffle pockets (or indentations or whatever those things are called). This plus the real maple syrup and butter is a sick....deliciously sick....combo. The griddle cakes are still awesome...like I said before, they taste like pancakes your grandma would make if your grandma was a really awesome cook. Also, the coffee no longer tastes like metal, it is, in fact, quite enjoyable. All in all, this place is good, especially when you don't have to wait.

So the BF and I went to check out the food trucks at the Phoenix Public Market today... such a good idea! We split a Bodhi Beef melt and it was really tasty. The girl that works in the truck was also super friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend trying this place.... it's not just grilled cheese, it's super fresh and delicious sandwiches with some nice ingredients. Next time I might get the veggie.... looks good!

The BF and I decided to try something new and different for breakfast yesterday and as I looked on the Yelp app, this place came up. The BF was a little skeptical of going to vegetarian/vegan restaurant, but I convinced him because, generally, breakfast is vegetarian. Let me start by saying that this space is SO cute! I love the old pictures on the wall, the green wall, the painting of Mr. Lucky's, and the large window walls at the front of the restaurant. I told the BF that this place could be picked up and put in Seattle and not be out of place at all. Secondly, the service was great. Everyone was friendly and our waiter was on our coffee, which I appreciate. I had the curry waffle and the eggplant bacon and the BF had the banana pancakes. My waffle was good, different than anything I have ever had, but I wasn't a huge fan of the eggplant....it was seasoned a little bit on the heavy side for me, luckily, the waffle was plenty of food. The BF's pancakes were delish....it had rum cinnamon bananas on it which were unreal. I would definitely come back here for breakfast again...I really want to try their biscuits and gravy because I don't love sausage gravy and this place uses a poblano gravy with corn (or something like that)....which sounds awesome, and who doesn't love biscuits? When we went to pay, we could see one of the cooks/chefs making the biscuits fresh in the back...so that's pretty awesome too.

I have been here several times and each time it has been delicious... finally a five star worthy place near me. Anyway, I have been here for breakfast, dinner, and dessert and all has been wonderful. The best breakfast item by far is the koo koo bananas pancakes. The bananas are amazing and the cakes are also wonderful. The biscuits and gravy are good too, they don't try to make it taste like sausage, which I like, they let it taste like veggies. I also had the chickpea burger for dinner. It was good, especially with their bbq sauce. Also, the salad has an amazing raspberry dressing...yum. They also have amazing pies and tarts.... they had a chocolate almond tart that was so freakin good... and vegan....and gluten free....what? Is that possible??? Awesome! Definitely give this place a try.

I went here with a large group for the hike and brew UYE. The service was really good for having such a large party (around 20 people). They have a large selection of house brewed beers. I tried the hef and it was very tasty. The husband had the cream and enjoyed it very much, it was kind of sweet for a cream and very tasty. We shared the poutine and it was alright, it consisted of thick cut fries (unlike the fries they serve with sandwiches which are thin), cheese curds, gravy, and short rib. The short rib was good and fairly plentiful, it was cooked to the point where it was falling apart... very nice. The overall flavor of the poutine was good, but not the best I had ever had. Despite this, I would get it again. Additionally, it was only 12$ and was plenty of food for 2 people.  I would certainly come here for the beer again in the future.   PS they had amazing sounding desserts.... def want to try that.

The husband and I went to Modern Marg for a pre event happy hour. The bar itself is comfortable, with big cushy bar stools. The bartender was friendly and efficient, though his descriptions of the drinks were a little lacking (I asked which of the happy hour margs he would personally get and he replied ' uh, if you want agave nectar get this one... etc, not answering the question, just naming the ingredients, which I already knew). I had the Modern Margarita, which really tasted like tequila on ice. This was ok, especially for only 5$, but not the tastiest marg by any means. The husband had the Victoria beer on tap. The bartender was enthusiastic about this beer, so that was nice, and with good reason, because it was exceptional. We also had the salsa flight, which was very good and satisfying. The smoky salsa was tasty, almost like a bbq salsa, but the best of the three was the pico, which was just the right amount of spicy for a pico and tasted very fresh. The tomatillo salsa was lacking, not amazing. The salsas came with the largest basket of chips I have seen in a long time. We felt like we ate a full bag of chips, and the basket was still half full (yes, I am an optimist). This place is way out of my usual 'hood, so clearly it isn't a place I would frequent, but if they are in your 'hood, I would check them out for happy hour.

I just picked up some pho ga from Pallets for dinner tonight. I called, ordered it to go, and it was ready about 15 minutes later....perfect! They pack the pho up nicely in 3 separate packages, broth/chicken, noodles, and toppings (very hot jalapenos...just what I like, bean sprouts, lemon, a sweet/spicy sauce, basil, and some other herb that was really good). When I got home, the pho was still steaming hot. I put aside half of it in a separate container for lunch tomorrow, and the half I had was plenty of food for dinner. The pho was really good....I haven't had pho so good since living in Seattle. It beat the pants off of Rice Paper (whose pho had no flavor at all). The broth of this pho was just the right amount of oniony to be delicious. Seeing as I live walking distance from this place and it has a nice looking bar, I think I just might become a regular!

Holy deliciousness batman.... why hadn't I tried this place before? I was a fool, I thought a place with reviews like this couldn't possibly be good, but I was wrong. First of all, this place offers 2 hour parking validation for the brickyard lot, that's a great start. They have happy hour with a variety of drink and food specials. I had a drink that involved green tea and Korean alcohol of sorts... it was so so, but the bartender took is back without an issue, added some sweetness and made it something delicious... all for 5$. You can't beat that. I will say that their build your own ramen is a bit pricy, with a fairly plain bowl without meat starting at 8$, but they also have many bowls of ramen for only 6$ that have meat and various veg included. I went with the spicy which came with pork and scallions and I added roasted garlic and spicy corn. The ramen was really tasty, rich, maybe not quite as spicy as I'd like, but definitely good. It was a large portion and tasted great the next day as leftovers. My friend had one of the other 6$ ramens.... the one with the pork belly and the mix of pork broth and soy broth.... her ramen was insane.... I have never tasted such a rich and delicious broth before. We were both completely satisfied. There is definitely a return visit in my future!

#100 for 2013! Woot! Anyway, I went to SOLO for my birthday dinner with my mom and it was very good! We shared the funghi pizza and the pasta with the nettle pesto. The pizza was great, it was fresh and earthy. It had a pancetta agrodulce on it, which was good, kind of like a dressing, but I thought it would have had pieces of pancetta on it. The pasta was also very good, the pesto was delicious and the peas were fresh. We shared a bottle of delicious moscato d'asti, half priced because it was Wednesday, and for dessert we had the budino which was nice and tasted like nutella and was very tasty. On top of all that, the prices were very reasonable. I had plenty of food for lunch for 2 days after the meal. I would definitely come back to SOLO again!!!

A friend and I came here last Friday night before going to the Summer's End Music Fest. The only disappointing part? I bought tickets to the music fest when I could have heard the entire concert from this bar! This place is right across from Tempe beach park. The bar is nice, much more modern than the inside of Monti's. The happy hour has some great food specials- many items for 7$ each. My friend and I shared the Texas toast slider things (really just a burger cut into 4 pieces) and the prime rib tacos. The tacos were yummy... fresh tasting with just enough spice. They were very meaty and overflowed with toppings... would definitely get again. The burger was also delicious. It was a burger on texas toast with bacon, roasted jalapeno, and fried onion straws.... how could that be bad? Additionally, they had a special for the weekend of 5$ margs, and they were solidly tasty margs. The service was attentive. I would certainly recommend!

I think it is really more of a 3.5, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt as I have only been here once and give them the 4 stars. Let me start by saying that I came across this place as I way planning a trip to Maui for this summer and when I realized that Coconut's opened in Scottsdale I figured we would try it here first. I was very excited that they serve ono fish (my personal favorite and one of the only fish I like). I went with my mom and the BF yesterday for lunch. The BF got the fish and chips and my mom and I shared the fish tacos (thankfully!). The BF thought the fish and chips were just ok. I thought they were pretty meh. They didn't have a lot of flavor and I definitely wouldn't return here for the fish and chips. The fish tacos, on the other hand, were very tasty. The fish was tasty and not too 'fishy.' The sauces and slaw were all very delicious and came together nicely with the fish. My complaints include that you cannot pick up the taco, it is too big and it's hard to eat, the bottom tortilla was so hard I had to saw through it with a knife to eat it, and I wish they had the option of getting one taco because I feel that I could not go here alone because I don't want to throw away a whole taco (it's way too much food). The prices are high, but they do give you a lot of food. I would probably come here again if someone else suggested it or if I were in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't rush out and drive across town to come here.

Oh man....this place was....not good. I'm sorry to say it! It really was not good. I went here for brunch this morning with the bRUNch group (so, to be fair, there was a large group of people, but the ordering was staggered). A bunch of us got the 'cinnamon toast' chicken and waffles after it got a high recommendation from the waitress. This was one of the worst chicken and waffles I have ever had (and this was the consensus of everyone I talked to). The chicken was dry, bland, not sweet, did not have any flavor resembling cinnamon toast crunch, and was not even crunchy...it's in the title...come on. The waffle was spongy, you could barely cut it...there was no crunch to this either and it was bland...super bland. I ate maybe half...after running a 5k...so it's not like I wasn't hungry. The waitress came by to ask how it was and we all said ...ehhh.... and her response was 'oh well, people have different tastes.' This was not a matter of different tastes. I saw others' food including omelets and chorizo biscuits and gravy. The report was that the biscuits and gravy was even worse than the chicken, but I didn't try it, so I really can't say. I would say the only good thing at this restaurant was the mimosas, but they were tiny and overpriced. Will not be back, sorry guys!

The BF and I went to the grand opening last night and I was pretty impressed. This restaurant/bar has a nice modern vibe and an extensive menu of hot items and sushi. We sat on the patio where the misters were out of control (read: it felt like it was a rainy day and we were just barely under an awning....not that this was a bad thing). We ended up sharing a few items including: Cucumber rolls (pretty standard), buffalo chicken roll (this was ridiculously good...the buffalo sauce was spicy and delicious, the chicken was crunchy, it was a definite winner), and the kobe burger with Tokyo fries (the burger was good, it had caramelized onions and spicy aioli on it and came on some kind of flatbread....definitely tasty...they cooked it a little over what we ordered it at, but it was still tasty. Additionally, they forgot to give us the fries, but when I told our waiter he got them for us, so no problem there. The fries were good, nice and crispy and they had been fried in fish oil so they had a slight fish taste to them....but in a good way).  We also had a few drinks, that were all tasty. I had the deep water, which tasted like a jolly rancher, but not in that weird synthetic way some drinks like that may taste, but in a fresh way. It was very good. I also tried the revolver which had a delicious ginger flavor. The BF had whiskey sours which were on special for only 3$ (awesome!) and they were also tasty. Overall, there were a few snags, but it was good. I will definitely try them again.

I went to the new Cafe last weekend just to get coffee, so I don't yet have any insight on their food quality. They use Cartel coffee, so clearly the coffee is good. The latte that I had was alright, but not the most skillfully made latte I have ever had. The restaurant itself is very cute. I love what they did with the space, it has a very nice feeling with the stained concrete floors, brick walls, and general funky feeling. I like that they still sell some local products, kind of an homage to the old public market and the pastries look tasty. I will definitely have to come here to try the food in the near future. I'm glad we have a new place in the neighborhood!

I have been back to the Cafe several times since my last review (the place is right next to my house!), and I must say, I like this place...a lot. I have tried their lentil soup (very good sweet to savory ratio with the coconut milk), rotisserie chicken (very moist), sweet potato (cooked well, didn't love the butter), French silk pie (ohhhh soooo chocolatey and rich...definitely my fave dessert here), the blondie (a little too sweet, but the BF likes it), and the chocolate stout cake (this is actually one I didn't like...the cake is kind of dry and the frosting is too buttery...not my fave). Also, I went to the elite event here and sampled some delicious food, but I noticed the wonderful porcetta sandwich we got to try isn't on their menu! That needs to be added stat! We also got to try a delicious ice cream sandwich with corn cookies, which tasted like harder and sweeter cornbreads....it was pretty bomb. Further, I tried their Farmer's cup drink (several times even :-P) and it is one of the most delicious drinks I have had in a long time....I love that it is both a little fresh from the cucumber, sweet from the lemonade, and spicy from the basil and pepper. I'll definitely be back (in fact, planning on going tonight for happy hour, which is 3 to close all summer...awesome!).   PS They have a special right now where you can get any sandwich and a beer for 8$ on nights when there are D Backs home games....pretty sweet deal.

Ya, I know, another update. I had to write about how much I love this place's happy hour. It is 3-close everyday. You heard me, everyday! Amazing. I have been here a whole bunch for happy hour including before the rehearsal dinner with a large group for my wedding, a friend's birthday, and new years eve. You can't beat it, pitchers and cocktails for 5$. The service here is a little inconsistent...there is a guy who works the bar who seems to space out and doesn't acknowledge your existence...not cool, but the girl who works behind the bar with the 'hawk is awesome! Funny, great at making drinks, and friendly. I am still in love with the farmer's cup and get that every time. I have also had their special white sangria, which is delicious, the marg  (which is good, but strooong), and the red sangria, which is good but the farmer's cup prevails as my favorite (can't beat the sweet/sour/fresh/spicy combo and the salt and pepper rim). I recently was introduced to their pretzels and cheese sauce.... oh my goodness that stuff is wonderful. The cheese sauce is spectacular... I can eat it with a spoon (and I have). It is so flavorful, kind of oniony and creamy and delicious... I can't even describe it, you just need to go taste it. It comes with two soft pretzels that are the perfect consistency and come out hot and ohhh so good. Go there. Get it. Thank me later.   PS what happened to the porcetta sandwich from the Yelp event? Put it on the menu guys, it is so awesome, the world must taste it. K thanks. Also, if you all were open later than 10, I would come out... just sayin.  pps I brought home a strawberry 'poptart' and ate it tonight (a day later) and it was ridiculously good... So flaky and delicious, just the right amount of sweet... Yummmm.

I am really surprised by the overwhelmingly negative reviews of this apartment building. I lived at Alta/ Skyline for a year and a half moving out a few months ago due to buying a house. This was certainly the nicest apartment I have ever lived in. The layout of the apartment was open and made it feel extremely large. The facilities were well maintained (gym, game room area, and pool) and cleaned daily (I personally observed this). The staff from both Mark Taylor and Weidner were nice and I never had an issue with service requests. I will say that there were things that were not wonderful : the rent was very pricey (as much as a mortgage or more), the man who did clean the hallways was always smoking, making the hallways smell like cigarettes, we had an issue at move in with installing direcTV...saying we couldn't drill any holes, but I know everyone else with a dish had a small hole drilled, the tiles in the kitchen did crack easily, and the cabinets were made of some cheapy (almost like paper) on top of plain wood with some pieces just randomly falling off after living there for about a year.... but it's an apartment, so I'm not sure what people expect...do they want marble counter tops in an apartment? A little ridiculous. The location is great and I met a lot of cool people here... I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place.  PS I never had bugs here, that was awesome PPS They use some really nice smelling cleaning product in the elevator PPPS When I moved out, I was charged about 50$ for cleaning and that's it plus the walk through was very relaxed.... I spent 5 or so hours cleaning, but hey, the guy who said they charged over 1000$ to either had a lot of damage or the policy changed in a very short period of time.

I am not giving Melanie a 4 because I don't like my hair cut, I do! My own personal Yelp philosophy is I have to go twice before giving a 5 stars. Anyway, I, like many others, got the Groupon for a cut and color (which was a smoking deal by the way). Melanie was nice enough and she seemed to know what she was doing. She listened to my thoughts and then did her thing. I must say, when she was done, I wasn't sure how I felt about my hair (I had her style it straight and she asked if I wanted her to stop after blow drying, which I didn't because it was frizzy, so then she flat ironed it totally flat and it looked somewhat dreary... I probably would want something between, but she really couldn't have known that). To me, it looked kind of plain and I didn't love it going out the door. Luckily, once I washed it and it was curly again, I really loved the cut. It's super cute and the color is great too, exactly what I had asked for. Was it the best hair experience I have had in Phoenix? No, but it was very good and I would recommend it.

This new breakfast restaurant from Colorado is awe...some... I was super impressed, and the husband was too. I almost don't want to tell anyone because I don't want to have to wait for hours to eat here (ha.). So, to start, the restaurant is decorated cutely, definitely not reminiscent of the souper salad or whatever that was there before. We sat down and read the story of their coffee...I guess the owner went to Guatemala and personally picked out the coffee they use....pretty cool stuff, also was tasty. Then our waitress came by to see if we were ready, I told her I was between two things, and she said, oh well that's great because we order half and half anything for the same price....I was flabbergasted. What?!?! Yup. You can get half pancakes half tacos or two different types of benedict or half french toast half benedict or whatever.....that is the coolest thing ever!!!! I love variety, so this kinda rocked my socks. I ended up ordering half harvest bene and half chilaquiles bene. The husband got the pineapple upside down pancakes (PS you can get flights of pancakes...3 different types....ahhhh!). The harvest bene was good, had a goat cheese polenta cake, leeks, other fresh veg...with a perfectly poached egg and hollandaise. As good as that was, the chilaquiles was Ah mazing! Delicious roasted beef barbacoa, spicy tomato pico, another perfectly poached egg and a cheddar hollandaise....it was heaven on a plate. Even the potatoes were good (and I'm not a huge breakfast potato fan). The husband loved his pineapple pancakes....he said they were the best pancakes he's had in town...to quote him 'these pancakes were better than any I had on any Hawaiian island.' I will definitely be back and if it's consistently this good, it will be a five star for sure.

I went here tonight for their grand opening and was shocked by how not impressive the food was. I hate to give a negative review as a first review and also hate to give a negative review to a place that allowed me to come to their grand opening, but it just wasn't very good. The food they were serving definitely should have been good, for example, they had a kobe beef slider....sounds good, right? No....it was not good. It was ground kobe, not sure why you would grind such expensive meat, and it was covered in a weird sauce and then topped with velveeta. Yes....velveeta. It was such a waste of a good meat, you couldn't taste the meat at all...it could have been ground anything for all you could tell. Additionally, the BF found a bone in his....not so appetizing. They also had mini burger bites, that were decent, but the way they were served made it so you couldn't taste any of the toppings because they all fell off before it got to your mouth (they were little balls with bacon and whatnot on top skewered with a toothpick, so the bacon and things fell off when the burger was picked up). The crab mac and cheese was mediocre and I believe had velveeta in it as well....how weird. The pork sweet and spicy wings were an odd texture and tasted like frozen food. Not good. The only thing that was decent was the spicy mango cone....a mango pudding of sorts with cayenne in it served in an ice cream cone. We ended up leaving after only a short period of time because we didn't want to continue tasting/wasting their food....that's pretty bad when the food is free. Maybe this place just needs to work out some kinks, but it was surprising that they hadn't done so before this event.

What a fun event! I just about needed to be rolled out of there after so much dessert. We got to try 4 flavors of gelato (all delicious), nutella croissants (so flaky and delish), several different types of cakes, cupcakes (red velvet, good as always, and hostessesque ones, also delish), cookies, champagne....it was as good as it sounds. We got to walk around the bakery and see all of the equipment was cool.....the walk in freezer was especially cool :-P. Thanks Lindsey and LGO for putting on such an awesome event!

I (finally) went to the Attic last night with the husband for their Wed night burger and beer special (10$ for both). I was surprised (and I guess I shouldn't have been) that they had valet... I have a huge pet peeve for valet, especially when I see that the car is just parked in a normal space...not double parked or whatever would necessitate valet... but I digress. We went up the stairs to find a chalkboard to put our name on the waitlist... cute idea. We waited a short amount of time and were seated. The place was very busy, but our service was fast, friendly, and efficient. The husband and I each got the Ivan with bacon, I got a side salad and he had fries. The burger was a very standard burger. It wasn't anything I was terribly excited about, but it was large and tasty enough for the price. I will say, I wouldn't want to pay full price for this particular burger, but the hangover burger sounded good. The salad was tasty and had a great balsamic vinaigrette. I would come back here for their specials again and would like to try their happy hour, but I am not sure that I would come here on a regular day (the hangover burger is 14$.... that's a bit steep).

The husband and I went here for restaurant week last Friday and I must say that I was very impressed. I have been wanting to try this place for a long time, so when I saw their menu for RW I made a reservation right away. We started with a complimentary cocktail (mango sorbet in prosecco) and it was very tasty and refreshing. For appetizers, the husband got the lamb polpette with feta sauce... so delicious.. these little meatballs were packed with flavor, and I got the octopus panzanella. Now, I have had octopus before and didn't care for it, but I wanted to give it another chance. This was very good. The sauce they served it with and the herbs were wonderful! My only issue with the dish was that the bread was really tough and hard to cut (I ended up tearing it with my hands... not very lady like, but you gotta do what you gotta do). This octopus was far better than the first time I had tried it... I still don't think I am an octopus lover, but I did like it. For entrees, the husband got the pork chop and I had the steak. The pork chop was huge... I mean super huge. It was also tasty. He said it was was the best pork chop he'd ever had and, to quote him, it was 'comfort food elevated.' The steak was perfectly cooked and the chimichurri was delicious... very bright and herbacious. It came with a potato hash of sorts with a duck egg on top, cheese curds, and gravy.... sort of like a poutine. It was also amazingly delicious, but so rich I couldn't eat it all. For dessert we split the peanut butter and chocolate cake and the mascarpone ice cream with figs... the chocolate cake was a little on the dry side for me, but the ice cream was incredible... would eat that over and over! We also had coffee, and, though it was very good coffee, I wish we had gotten a refill.  I would definitely like to come back here again.    PS the service here was perfect, attentive, friendly, but not invasive... just great.    PPS you can tell how fancy a restaurant is by how many words in the review are underlined in red because the computer thinks they're spelled wrong... this place is pretty fancy :-P

After perusing pizza places in the N Phoenix area, I found this hidden gem (thanks Yelp!). I needed some food to bring to my mom who lives up in this area. We ordered a cheese pizza (14 inch for 10 bucks... can't beat it) and an order of bruschetta (7$ ish). The man who was working there (the owner?) was really friendly and they had our pizza ready in 15 minutes. The pizza itself was surprisingly good. Very classic NY style pizza with a good sauce to cheese ratio. The sauce was also nicely seasoned and flavorful. The bruschetta was good, but a bit on the greasy side. The flavors were nice despite this and the bread did not get soggy, so that was good. If I were in the area, I would definitely come back!

This restaurant was like a little slice of hipster downtown Phoenix in Mesa. The space is nicely decorated and has a 'cool' atmosphere. I went with a friend and we each got the dinner plate. Unfortunately, they were out of more than half of their variety of empanada... it was only around 6 pm.... Anyway, the empanadas I ended up getting were very good. Got the Cubana and the Boricua. The Cubana was very flavorful, and though I don't typically like ham, I really liked this. The Boricua was also good with pulled pork and a yellow rice.... it even has olives in it, which I don't like, but I liked this. The crust of their empanadas was thin and crispy....really delicious. The green sauce they provide is good, with nice heat, but is really strong with raw onion... I could taste it in my mouth all night. The dinner plate also came with rice and beans (which were both pretty standard, nothing special) and maduros which were very tasty. We shared dessert, a fig and cheese with ice cream...this was tasty, but I didn't think the ice cream added too much...for the extra 3$, just get a second empanada. I would definitely come back here if I were in the neighborhood again.

The husband and I went here this morning as part of the coffee tour of Phoenix! I had been wanting to try this little place for awhile, so I was excited to go. The inside of the shop is very cute, which you may not guess when you see the exterior. After reading about the 'Vienna latte' I was curious what that was, so here is the skinny:   Vienna latte = latte, cinnamon, and vanilla syrup Spanish latte = latte, cinnamon, condensed milk   We got one of each. I thought the Spanish latte was way better than the Vienna, it was less sweet and tasted wonderful, but the Vienna was good too. I like that they have some original coffee drinks. I would definitely come back here.

Went to this cute little coffee shop this afternoon. The owner was having some tea when we arrived, but promptly got up and helped us out. We ordered and he brewed a fresh pot of coffee for me. It was tasty coffee. The husband got a latte and said he liked it better than Lux... I wouldn't go that far, but it was good. If you are in the area, check it out!

This review is somewhat unfair. I did go with a giant group of Yelpers, so I cannot say if the most excellent and amazing service was due to that, or if it is always like that, but I can say that, at least that night, the service was wonderful. The manager (who seemed to be one of the yelper's friends possibly?) was amazing. He was attentive without being overbearing and he remembered all of our names... that's right, like 25 of our names.... that is insanity! We came for happy hour and build your own burgers and happy it was! They had many delicious beers on tap, with the local beers being on special for 4$. I had a Four Peaks peach... it was delish, as per usual. The build your own burger deal is pretty amazing, you fill out an order form with all of the toppings you would like for 10$. I think I put too many toppings on....here is the run down on my ridic burger:  Pretzel bun Angus beef gruyere and cheddar cheese roasted tomato, caramelized onion, roasted green chilis, jalapenos, guac steakhouse butter bacon over easy egg hot sauce... on the side.    That's right... this was burgerious maximus. Unfortunately, when the burger came out it was missing several of the toppings (including the bacon, blasphemy!) and the over easy egg was nearly cooked through. This was a little disappointing, but maybe was a blessing, because this burger was monsterous, hard to eat, a total mess, and delicious the way it was. Would I like bacon next time? Yes, definitely. But I will try to edit myself....*try* being the operative word. I could only eat half and I was sooo full. I also had sweet potato tots.. they were good, but after trying someone else's chips...those are definitely the way to go.   As others have mentioned, they have a great Yelp check in special... 5$ off, and they honored it for all of us, which was totally unnecessary, but much appreciated. I will gladly return!

The husband and I got a late night slice here after mucho beverages and it was pretty delish, I must say. I got the forager and it was just super savory and amazing....the ricotta and the mushrooms just made for something special. The husband go plain cheese (surprise surprise) and it was good too. The price was also right at about 13$ for both of us. I would definitely go back.

This ice cream place is very cute and close to my house. The girl who was working last night when we went with Jon and Amy was so friendly and helpful and didn't mind giving us about 1000 samples. The ice cream comes in little Chinese food to go containers and have a fortune cookie on top....too cute. I thought the best flavors were the Superfood (nutella ish), coffee, and coconut (mmmm). This isn't my favorite ice cream ever, but it was pretty damn good.....I would recommend it if you are in the neighborhood.

I went to Hopdoddy yesterday with a few friends. I was excited to try this place since it is associated with the Salty Sow, which is fairly delish. Also, I had a coupon, so I was excited about that as well. I got to the restaurant later than my friends, so they told me to just sit at the table and they would come take my order instead of having me order at the counter. All of the employees were friendly and accommodating. I ordered a goodnight burger, sassy sauce on the side (sassy sauce is like a mayo, horseradish, and mustard concoction) with a fried egg on top and a pretzel nutella shake.... so pretty healthy. The shake was awesome. I don't typically like or order shakes, but this one was a good mix of salty and sweet. I only drank half and brought the other half home for later enjoyment. The burger was good, but super messy. It had a mess of onions, bbq sauce, cheese, and egg on it.... things were falling out all over the place. This place could use more sturdy buns for their more messy burgers. Anyway, the flavor was good and overall I enjoyed it. Also, the price was right at only 7$ for the burger and 1$ for the egg (wow, way less than expected), 5.50 for the shake (but worth every penny....). I would come back if I were in the neighborhood.

I will admit that at first I thought the idea for this restaurant was kind of dumb... build your own pizza.... aren't all pizzas build your own? BUT I was wrong. The idea behind this place is build your own pizza with as many toppings as you want for the same price... I can get down with that! I built a ridiculous pizza... wheat crust, spicy sauce, fresh mozz, ricotta, tomato, pears, caramelized onions, garlic, basil, spinach, and bacon..... ohhh yaa! It was good. Also, it was huge and I ate two giant lunches from the one pizza (probably could have stretched it to 3). Further, it was 9$. You heard me, 9$! I pretty much couldn't be happier. The people who work here were friendly, helpful, and patient with me (even when adding a zillion toppings). I would definitely come back if I were in the area!   PS this place is owned by Crust.... so if you like their pizza, you'll probably like this place.

I went to the Refuge yesterday after yoga for breakfast and coffee (sorry for my gross self coming in, haha) as part of my coffee tour of Phoenix (ftw!). The people working here were nice enough and the prices were pretty standard. I got a latte and a bacon/egg/cheese/potato breakfast burrito. The 4 star review is really for the latte alone, the latte was very good...the burrito, on the other hand, was not very good at all. It was very large, too big for just me. It had a lot of egg in it compared to other ingredients and didn't have much flavor (was supposed to be southwestern, not sure what made it southwestern at all). It was served with some terrible, flavorless salsa... just overall not impressive. I would come back for coffee, but not for food.

This place has a great happy hour! The Husband and I went and got arancini, poutine, and a margherita pizza.....I was expecting the happy hour portions to be tiny...they were HUGE! There were like 8 arancini balls and they were some of the best I have had....crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and (best of all) the rice still had some texture like a good risotto should. The balls come on top of some wonderful marinara and a balsamic sauce. The poutine I did not LOVE, but it was a huge portion and was good....just got soggy in areas. The pizza was very good. We also had kronenburg beer for 2$/pint. I will be back!!!

This event was a lot of fun, but, I must say, it wasn't as awesome as other similar events HOWEVER, I did like that the money went to charity for this event. This event was super packed and, at times, I felt a little cattle like trying to get from place to place, but at other times it wasn't so bad. They had delicious lobster mashed potatoes from Mastro's and a few other tasty items (the food from Brat Haus, the little chocolate torte thing, the taco from Tom's Thumb, the wine/chocolate pairing station, press coffee, the tuna with coconut rice from Deseo (I think), the amazing gnocchi from Taggia etc), but a lot of the food was mediocre at best and also a lot was served cold (and not on purpose *cough* Flemings *cough* ) or was just plain bad (caketini...sorry guys...ugh). I agree with Pepper that it was kind of lame that large chunks of the event were taken up by places like Fry's or the tortillas you buy at the grocery store....not really what I went to the event to try. I think I liked Devoured better, but this event was still pretty fun. Thanks for posting it Becca!

Two words... Happy. Hour. This place has a great one. I went last night with my dad, step mom, and husband and we all ate including a dessert for 30$. Amazing! We got the sliders (5$), the flatbread (5$), and the fish tacos (5$). They also had other items that were less expensive like dips and breads and whatnot that were 3-4$, but we didn't try those. Aaanyway, the flatbread of the day was a roasted tomatillo, roasted garlic, cheddar, mozz, and sausage... ohh soooo good. The roasted veg was awesome. I kind of loved it. It was pretty large as well. The sliders (3) came with a big pile of fries and were also quite large. They were very tasty and the bun was especially good and flavorful... which you don't typically find on a slider. The fish tacos (4) were also large and just a little spicy, they came with a really good tomatillo salsa. For dessert we got a brownie to share at the waiter's recommendation, but this was my least favorite part of the meal. The brownie was absolutely flavorless... what a waste of calories.  Although I don't think I would recommend the brownie, I will certainly be back for happy hour!  PS Like its predecessor Local Breeze, this place has a great patio, large and pretty with a bocce ball court! Alright!

There are hardly words to describe the deliciousness of this restaurant.   I have heard about the Fry Bread House, as most of us probably have, because this little local restaurant has won a James Beard award which is.... odd. Usually the words 'James Beard' evoke imagery of white tablecloths, waiters with the contraptions to clean crumbs from the table, ridiculous numbers of forks for various purposes..... well, this isn't that place (at all). This restaurant is (temporarily) located in the old Pancho's buffet, which, as you know, was a very classy establishment (heh). They did pretty much nothing to make the space their own.... The buffet area is sectioned off with a sheet hanging from the ceiling, some of the extra rooms house other businesses (Native American art anyone?), and the floors/walls/tiles/etc are all the same. This is understandable as they have announced that they are moving (again) to 7th ave and Camelback (ish) early next year.   Anyway.... the husband and I came here with the International Supper Club on Wednesday night. The clientele was eclectic to say the least, but that is part of the charm. They have the menu posted on the wall, you order at the counter, and they deliver your food to the table. We had the cheese crisp, the green chili combo taco, and the butter and chocolate fry bread to share. The cheese crisp is a waste of time... it isn't bad, but it isn't anything special.... definitely skip (especially for the price... 6$... almost as much as the tacos). The taco was... incredible. It was love at first bite. The green chili pork was slightly spicy, soft, and full of flavor. The beans were delicious (and I don't typically like refried beans at all). The combination of those with cheese, lettuce, and fry bread (and a little of their house hot sauce) was unlike anything I have ever put in my mouth. This cannot be compared to fry bread you get at the fair... this is so much better. I want another.... like right now.   So what could top the taco? The chocolate and butter fry bread, that's what. The husband was expecting Hershey's syrup.....this was about as far from Hershey's as you can get. Rich, melty, decadent chocolate oozed on top of hot fried dough complemented by melted butter made for one of the top desserts I have had in a long time. This thing is not healthy. I don't care. It was great.    Take home point: Go here. Close your eyes. Imagine the white tablecloths. Ignore the grungy location. Sink your teeth into some decadently unhealthy deliciousness and smile.

I went to WhereUBean yesterday after yoga with a friend yesterday after finding that most coffee places in Ahwatukee are closed at 4...what? It's true. Anyway, finding this place is a bear...the sign says 'Sell us your gold'... doesn't scream coffee shop. Turns out that the place is also a gold shop....but the owner always dreamed of having a coffee shop so he added one on...pretty strange stuff. The guys who work there were nice and the prices were decent. Also, they use Intelligentsia coffee, which is pretty good stuff. I had a latte and it was good, not the best I've ever had, could have had more foam, but good flavor. My friend had a vanilla latte and said that though it was not very sweet, it tasted good. I would go back if I were in the area and wanting coffee.

The Husband and I went here on our self made 'food crawl.' We has already gotten some monkey bread and an (awful) sushi roll, we were looking forward to some pizza. We had been waffling between going here and going to Pomo, but decided to go here because it was closer and we figured they would be about the same. When we got here, we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. The service was prompt and friendly. We decided to just get two items here and cut out the last place on our crawl. We ordered the arancini and the fried pizza. The arancini sounded really good..... but it was really bad. It was not cooked enough, the cheese in the middle wasn't melted at all...still cubes. The meat was in one clump, not mixed into the risotto as I would have thought. The frying oil may not have been hot enough because the arancini tasted like it was just full of oil.... pretty gross. We did eat it anyway as we spent 8$ on it, but I would not recommend it to anyone. Then our pizza came. Again, wasn't cooked long enough. Really? The cheese wasn't melted. Did they not see that? The sauce was cold and tasted like the can. The fried dough was, again, way too oily, probably because the oil wasn't hot enough. It was like a bland greasy doughnut with unmelted cheese and can tasting tomatoes on top. So gross. I took most of it to go and gave it to a homeless person. That plus a couple of beers was like 45- 50$....what a huge waste of money. Will not be back.

I went here with the BF, my brother, his gf, and my niece and nephew yesterday for lunch. The place is cute, I like the way they have made the restaurant look...comfortable, yet modern. All of the food was delicious. I tried the Seoul pizza and it was delish...spicy, sweet, crunchy....just awesome. The crust was perfectly crunchy. The pizza was big enough for two people and only cost 9$. I also tried the monkey bread (really tasty little garlic knots) and the chop salad (not my fave, but I don't really like chopped salads generally). Also, they serve Hamm's! Can't beat it. I may just become a regular here.

This review is split in two parts.   Part 1: The part where an unsuspecting Yelper wins an 80 minute facial and a bunch of awesome products  Yes, I was the lucky winner! It was very exciting. I scheduled my appointment with Deanna for my free facial. She made it easy, allowing me to text her to figure out a good time and date. Fast forward to when I arrived... NOTE TO VISITORS- this place is not in the Palomar even though they are owned by them... it is next to Urban Outfitters on the second floor.... Ok, anyway, the girl who was working the front desk was very friendly and helpful. I was shown back to the spa area for the facial. It was amazing! So relaxing. The product all smelled good and felt nice. Deanna was great, friendly, and explained each product and what it was doing, very professional. Before I left, Deanna showed me around their very cute and modern salon. I headed out... but, hold the phone! Outside the door was a sign with lunch time specials for the salon... kind of like a beauty happy hour.. it's Tues- Fri and there are discounts on men and women's haircuts and waxing... well, that got my attention. I was in need of some waxing services... I ran back in to make an appointment.   Part 2: The part in which the Yelper seems a little crazy and comes to the salon two days in a row...   I made an appointment with Deanna for the very next day for *don't read on family!* a brazilian and an eye brow wax. She was extremely professional and clean. She made me feel comfortable and did a great job. She really fixed my eyebrow that had been totally destroyed the last time I got waxed, so I appreciated that. Further, the special pricing was great (55$ for both).   So why only 4 stars? I would like to try some of their other services and also their prices can be a bit high when they aren't running specials. The parking is a little bit of a pain at Cityscape, but they do validate for the whole day, so that is nice. I will definitely be back!  PS The ladies at this salon said they may be coming out with a new menu of services soon due to the change in ownership, so I'm interested to see what those changes look like.

I went to Bei yesterday with the family after a failed attempt at going to Totties (that is sort of another story, but some people had been waiting there over an hour.. yikes!). Anyway, My dad, stepmom, husband, and I arrived here at around 12:45 and it was fairly empty. My dad and I split the noodle and rice bowl combo (this thing is huge... like 2 full entrees) with the spicy chicken noodles and the spicy pork bowl and . The husband had the beef teriyaki bowl and my stepmom got the tempura bento box. The gyoza was pretty standard... like the frozen type, not awesome. The salad had a fairly good ginger dressing on it, but too much of it... like a pool at the bottom. I thought the spicy chicken noodles were very tasty, just the right balance of sweet and spicy on thick noodles with vegetables and chicken. The spicy pork was even better, it was spicy and had the right amount of sauce to rice ratio... I liked both very much. The rest of the food was fairly mediocre. Anyway, I would consider going back for the items I ordered, but probably wouldn't get the other items.

This place is beyond cute... the decor is spot on with the mix of vintage pieces, mismatched furniture, and 'hipster' -y decor. I only had a latte here, but it was a good coffee. They use Cartel, but they do a good job foaming the milk to the point where it is very rich and creamy. I would come back for coffee. They also have many beers available (very nice), so I would like to come back to try that. It might not be the best place to hang out and get work done as it is very loud, but it would be a fun place to hang out at with friends. Check this place out!  PS Love the bathrooms - chalkboard walls FTW! PPS Pulling in to the lot of this place is a little difficult if you're coming from the south and don't know where it is.... it is right at the point where Scottsdale diverts into Scottsdale and Goldwater.... you can turn in from either street, but Goldwater would probably be easier (since it's on the right then).

I thoroughly enjoyed this bar. The husband and I went here the other night to get an after dinner drink. The place was hopping on a Thursday night. We got a couple seats at the bar, which, as others have said, is really neat and completely covered in pennies. We came for happy hour and it is a mighty fine happy hour. Many many many beers for 3$ and an almost equal number of wines for 5$. The owner (?) was very friendly, perfect host, and had great suggestions and knowledge about his beers and wines. He introduced me to a raspberry wit called whitakerke rose.... awesome! He added a splash of champagne to it.... absolute perfection. He also encouraged us to play some games and brought them over (the bar has lots of board games, old schools games, and trivia cards). Additionally, with a Yelp check in we got a free buckeye.... this thing was good. very rich peanut butter and chocolate. Excellent! I will most definitely be back here in the future and suggest you check it out too.

I was so glad to have stumbled upon this adorable noodle shop! I had bookmark this restaurant, but wasn't intending to eat here until I passed it on the deuce. It was very close to closing time when my friend and I got here , but the gentleman at the counter was very nice and didn't seem too bothered by our late arrival. My friend ordered a pasta dish with pancetta and asparagus that was light and springy. I ordered the beef bourguignon pasta dish that had a lot of flavor and perfectly tender beef. I love that they offer half portions. The half portion is on the small side but plenty for most people and reasonably priced at around $8. The garlic bread that came with the pasta was buttery and delicious. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting or living in Vegas.

Ohhhh yes. After coming here for the Yelp event, I knew I would be back, but I wasn't sure that it would be consistently good (I would guess a restaurant would try to be top notch for an event). That being said, this was just as good as the first time on our second trip. We went on a beautiful Phoenix winter day (70's and partly cloudy...ahhh) and sat on their lovely patio. We got the chips (which they had run out of at the event) and they were pretty amazingly delicious. They are crispy, but not too crispy and the sauce pairs with them perfectly. Additionally, I got a side of their wonderful and amazing jalapeno sauce....so good on just about everything....especially the chips. YUM! We also each got a Paris Texas burger....very tasty stuff. I like that they make their prosciutto crispy....I have never had it that way, and it is wonderful. The food here is pretty substantial too, ate it for a late lunch and was too full to eat again all night. I would say that this place doesn't have my favorite burger in town, but it is in my top 3. I definitely will be back.

Is there anyone here willing to argue that waffles aren't delicious? That's right, I rest my case.    Anyway, this place was not exactly what I expected when I read the Yelp reviews... I was picturing a cute little café with table service. What I got was essentially a coffee shop that happened to have waffles in a strip mall. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it just was completely unexpected. I was planning on getting a waffle and egg sandwich, until I found out that they use those weird egg patty things (they don't, you know, cook an egg), so that was out. Ended up getting the Elvis, waffle with peanut butter, bacon, and banana.... of course this was good, how could that be bad?!?! I also had their specialty latte with the cinnamon that comes with a triangle of the cinnamon vegan waffle (got the latte sans vanilla syrup, you know, being healthy and all... lol).... oh ya, super tasty. Definitely a dessert. The waffle was crisp and delicious, the latte was sweet and dessert -y. The breakfast was cheap and satisfying. I would return!

This location is certainly a step above their old location on Glendale. I went here with a large party (about 10 people) and they were very accommodating. They had a table ready for us on a Thurs night in about 10 minutes. In the meantime, the husband and I checked out their (very large) bar. He had a snakebite, which was prepared incorrectly (the cider and porter were mixed together instead of layered, but at least it was reasonably priced at 5$), I had the Shandy, which was unusually made with porter and lemonade (most shandys I have tried are with a lighter beer). I really enjoyed my drink! I felt like the lemonade lightened the otherwise heavy porter. Anyway, the service was good for our large party and the food didn't take too long to come out. We had several pizzas, a spaghetti and meatballs, a couple small calzones, wings, cheesy bread, and a couple salads. The sweet chili wings were maybe the best item... just enough heat and falling off the bone... really good wings. The cheese bread was good, but come on, it's melted cheese on bread (can't really be bad). The meatballs were good, but could have had a bit more sauce. The caesar salad was a little too fishy tasting, but their italian dressing was good. I had the 'mama's special' personal calzone add basil and ricotta. This thing was very tasty with garlic, tomato, and spinach.... and at just over 5$, it was a great price for the amount of food you get (fairly large). I would come back to this location!

Ok, ok, ok....I know most people at least somewhat like this place, but I could not find many redeeming qualities after my visit (and I love Parlor!). The husband and I went a couple weeks ago for happy hour after wanting to go for a long time. There were only a few people there when we arrived, so we were seated right away. I ordered a drink that had coconut milk amongst several other ingredients that was recommended by our server and is no longer on their menu as I checked today..... it took awhile to come out and when it did, I was informed that it used the last of their ingredients for the drink (so no chance of getting another one). The drink was supposed to be tiki ish, but it was more bitter...not awesome. The husband got the enabler (which I actually liked alright), he thought it was too sweet and it had a large amount of ice in it.... not a large amount of alcohol. Neither were particularly cheap even for happy hour. I ordered the 5$ ramen and let me tell you, I would be angry if I had paid full price for it. The portion was small, the kale in it was very pungent, the 'bacon' was so fatty and not rendered at all...inedible, the mushrooms were flavorless, the pork was ok, the broth was nothing but salty and boring...I needed their 'homemade' sriracha to make it edible....it just was not good and I am a big ramen fan. The husband got chicken wings and those must have been the thinnest chickens ever because there was barely any meat on them at all...additionally, they were flavorless, not spicy, just greasy and bland. Maybe it was a bad day, but it was seriously bad. I left not wanting to ever come back...sorry clever koi.

I was lucky enough to get to try Angry Crab in Mesa after becoming a fan of the AC in Phoenix. This place is just ridiculously good. I went with a group and the service was just so efficient and friendly. I was going to get fried cod, but they were out.... a blessing in disguise. I got the gumbo, which just has all kinds of whatever seafood they have in it and a side of Cajun fries with level 3 trifecta sauce (of course). The gumbo was legit. I usually don't like many types of seafood, but I liked everything in this thing. I have no idea what I ate... it was spicy and delicious. The serving was huge, I barely had room for my fries and ended up taking most home. Speaking of fries.... these things were crispy, spicy, well seasoned, and addictive.... I love these fries! Anyway, I took my leftover fries and sauce home... I swear, that trifecta sauce is good on anything... I even had some on popcorn... no joke, it was awesome. Definitely recommend this place!

The pup and I walked here yesterday so that he could socialize a bit with other dogs. Unfortunately, there was only one other dog here when we came. The facility was nice, but it was a little dirty with poop all over the ground... come on people, clean up after your pets. It was a little funny, my dog was scared of the doggie drinking fountain, but hopefully he'll get used to it. We will certainly be back!

I went to Bootleggers with my family for my family bday dinner. We sat on their patio and it was very nice out there, cool, quiet, and simply (but attractively) decorated with sunflowers on the tables. We had a party of 8 and they handled the party well. I got to try many items, some were great, some were mediocre, but overall it was good. Here is the rundown:  For a drink I got the hemingway daiquiri...it was very fresh and tasty. I thought it was a bit overpriced, but at least it tasted good.   For food I got to try:  Bacon plate - really good - lots of different types of bacon with some delicious mustard and roasted red peppers. My problem with it was the waiter didn't explain the dish...we didn't know which bacon was which...that's not cool.   Bootlegger burger - ehhh not as good as I would hope considering the components. It lacked a lot of flavor when you would think it'd be great (it has cheese, bacon, whiskey onions, etc...sounds great, wasn't so great). I think they should put some bbq on this burger and it would be greatly improved.   Pulled pork - delicious! so tender, tasty, great bbq sauce. It tasted especially good in the house made tortillas.   Ribs- not so good. These would be good if cooked a bit longer, but they were tough and stuck to the bone....not what you're looking for in a good rib and difficult to eat.   smashed potatoes- these things were great, very cheesy tasting and savory.   Grilled cauliflower steak - this was very good...covered in cheese and onions, I could have this for a meal.   Mac and cheese- good, but run of the mill, nothing too special.   Asparagus- nicely charred and tasted good with the lemon zest.    Unfortunately, they didn't have their bacon cake (which was kind of the reason I wanted to go here), but overall the restaurant was good. I would give them another try in the future.

After attempting to visit Ollie Vaughn's a couple times (but showing up when they were closed, boo!) the husband and I finally got to try this hidden gem out. The people who work here are lovely, friendly, and helpful people. We came at breakfast time during the week, so they weren't busy. Their egg sandwich is a 'build your own' egg sandwich, which I love! You can chose between a croissant or a biscuit (I got a biscuit), chose your cheese, how you want the egg, what meat you want, and veg. I had an over medium egg on biscuit with roasted tomatoes, gruyere cheese, and bacon.... it wasn't as good as my fave breakfast sandwich (when that one is good), but it was a close second. Very tasty and fresh. The husband had the biscuits and gravy... he loved it. The gravy was exceptional, they really let the quality of the ingredients shine... and it tasted good on the egg sandwich (new creation? I think so...). Their coffee was also good, they get it from a local roaster in Glendale. We also tried their cinnamon buns later that night, and they were soft and tasty... not overly sweet like some cinnamon buns can be. Needless to say, I will definitely be back!  PS Their decor is SO cute and their patio looks amazing if it weren't a thousand degrees outside  PPS 950, woohoo!

I was very excited to get Indian food while in Vegas as Phoenix's Indian food scene.... how can I say this nicely.... leaves something to be desired. After seeing the great reviews, I knew we had to check Delhi out. We came for the lunch buffet on a weekday and it was not overly crowded (which was nice). The buffet was large with an extensive selection of dishes. Most of the food was quite good, with the spicy chicken curry being the tastiest option (in my opinion). They also had a large variety of vegetarian options if that is something you are looking for. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have chai tea on the buffet, nor did they have my favorite Indian dessert (the rice pudding... yum)... but apparently the selection changes from day to day, so maybe we came on an off day. The price is good for all that you get (about 11$). I must admit that I have had a better Indian buffet experience in Vegas (Evergreen... yum), but this is another great option, especially if you are a local. Happy eating, Vegas!

I had the pleasure to go to El Chullo this morning for 'breakfast' (the quotes are because it was closer to lunch time and their breakfast foods are more like American lunch/dinner foods). This place is incredibly authentic. Our waiter (and possibly an owner?) is from a town just outside of Lima, so ya... pretty legit. The way their breakfast works is they have 3 choices that feed two people, each for 20$. The choices are chicharrones with a tamal, bread, and two coffees or a tenderloin sautee with bread and two coffees, or an egg dish with a tamal, bread and two coffees. We decided to get the tenderloin and add a tamal (cuz I wanted to try it). The tamal is large, delicious, and just like the ones I had when I was in Peru last summer... this is the real deal and very distinct from the typical Mexican tamale you may have elsewhere in Phoenix. The tamal has a little hard boiled egg (which obviously I ate and the husband didn't), some meat, some olives, and some hot peppers and served with an onion/citrus salad.... so good. I could just eat those tamals and be happy.  The tenderloin came in a sauce of sorts with onion and tomato and we ate it with the giant rolls given to us. The meat was soooo tender and flavorful. Their coffee was even good and we drank it black. The service is great. This place beats all of the other Peruvian restaurants that I have tried in town hands down and really took me back to when I was in Peru....like a little slice of vacation in my own neighborhood. I will certainly be back, I want to try dinner for sure and the chicharrones breakfast.... I think this place has serious 5 star potential, so we will see!

Joyride is a little bit of a mixed bag. When we arrived for happy hour the place was hopping. We were seated outside (without them asking if that was alright first, but it was alright...). When asked if it was still happy hour, the hostess replied 'is it before 5?' a little snarky.... but ok. The service overall was slow and somewhat inattentive, but they were busy so they have an excuse at least. The food and drinks, on the other hand, were very tasty. We ordered drinks, I asked what was better between the horchata with alcohol or the blood orange margarita.....well, they were out of the horchata, so marg it was. The marg was large, tasty, and at only 5$ on happy hour, I was a happy camper. The husband had the pineapple aguas frescas... this was less delicious. It just tasted like pineapple juice and alcohol... not bad, but not wonderful.  The salsa was just subtly spicy and full of flavor. The husband and I shared 3 tacos - fried fish, chicken tinga, and the pork. I would say the best was the fish, very light and crispy, followed by the pork, and then the chicken (which was fine, but was supposed to be spicy and wasn't really). Because we ordered 3 tacos, we got a side. Our server wasn't sure if they were out of rice (early in the afternoon?), but they did have it. It was fine, pretty standard rice, but the green salsa that was served on top was very tasty. The food was very filling and it was affordable, so I will most likely visit again!

I had the pleasure of trying Aioli Burgers at a catered event (so while I did not pay for my burger directly, I paid for the event). I had the California burger and it was good, but maybe not as good as I would think it would be considering the ingredients. The egg was overdone... it said it was sunny side... it wasn't. Regardless, the burger tasted good and the different aiolis were tasty. The fries were crispy and pleasant and the Husband enjoyed his burger (Italiano). I would give them a shot if I were to see them out and about.

I am very impressed with this place. I went with a friend after yoga last week (sorry Thailicious for our smellyness!) and we were a little wary since it hasn't been open long and when we entered it was mostly empty. Well, our wariness was unnecessary, this place was great. I asked the waitress what I should get between the noodle soup and the drunken noodles... she so delicately said.... ummm lots of.... white people... order drunken noodles. Ha!!! I ordered the noodle soup with beef at her suggestion. When the soup came out I was worried... it looked kind of gross... like brown water. Oh my god this soup was good. So flavorful, like a mix of a Thai soup and a pho. Tons and tons of flavor. I ate it all. I was planning on taking half home for lunch the next day. Uh oh. I ended up deciding to order another dish to go so I would have lunch the next day and got the drunken noodles. This portion was much larger than the soup, so I was able to eat it for two days. I will say, at a 4/5 star, it wasn't spicy. Also, though good, it didn't touch the flavor of the soup. I will come back here for that soup, so good!   Cons include - expensive for the portion size (can usually make at least two meals out of a 10$ bowl of soup, but not so here), the drunken noodles were not the best I have had, and they put a big mass of carrot strings on their noodles as garnish... don't really get this, why not put the carrot in the noodle mix? the carrot garnish was a little odd after heating the rest up the second day.

Wow.... this place may have a translated name of Squash Blossom, but it is nothing like the old squash blossom... in a good way! They completely redecorated and it now has a Latin club feel. A friend and I wandered in here Saturday night after I saw their open sign through the long hallway and wondered to myself....why is that breakfast place open at 9pm? Anyway, we sat at the bar and it was kind of awesome. We met a couple at the bar that were a lot of fun and we all did many shots...We did some series of shots that included tequila, lime juice, clamato, and beer... very interesting! We also did esperma shots (because of the funny name) which were good, shots of fireball with rum chata (delicious), and we had some of their pina colada based drinks that were sweet and tasty. The bar tender was nice and the prices were affordable (shots = 4$, drinks = 6 ish?). The place is on the loud side and I believe they had a DJ. As it got later, the bar got busier but the service remained very efficient and friendly. I had a great time here and would definitely come back.    PS Their food smelled SO good.....I want to try it ASAP... will update.

Since I have been off of work this past week, I have been trying to be good and going to hot yoga.... now, the only problem is my studio is right next to this place. Day after day I was tempted by their delicious barbeque -y smells wafting in my direction. Today, the husband and I went for happy hour. Very happy we did. The happy hour menu was good, food items under 10$ with large portion sizes. We split the piggly wiggly and the brisket sliders. The sliders were great, shredded brisket, bbq sauce, and a pickle... can't beat it... also, they were not cheap with the meat because of happy hour, the brisket was falling out of the buns. The piggly wiggly was a nice way to try a bunch of their offerings as it consists of pork belly, asparagus wrapped in prosciutto and some baby back ribs with bread and a spicy jam. I thought the pork belly was the weakest showing, with it having a lot of unrendered fat, but the meaty parts were good and that is kind of just the nature of pork belly, the asparagus was really good and had a tasty crumb on top of it, and the ribs were great, fall off the bone tender, and full of smokey flavor. We also got a couple of drinks... I got the gimlet, which was a tasty gin drink with basil and cucumber. The husband got a manhattan (his signature drink), but he thought it was just ok. The tab was 30$ after everything, so a pretty good deal. I would certainly recommend this place for happy hour.

The husband and I went to the Cheddatruck for our 5 monthaversary last week after seeing their menu the previous week. This place has some very interesting burgers on their menu including a burger served on a donut, a burger with mac and cheese on it, a burger with bacon and eggs on it, a burger with pastrami on it.... the combos were odd and plentiful. he husband got the burger with the mac and cheese and it was really good. He won the food contest for sure. The best part of this burger? The mustard....it was really tasty mustard. I got the mother hen burger that has an egg and bacon on it. The bacon was very crispy and tasty. The only issue was that the english muffin was a little small and the burger could have benefited from a different sauce from the one that came on it (a sriracha aioli)... maybe like that mustard? Oh ya.... We also got the cheese tots with the chipotle cream cheese... that was pretty delicious. I think I gained 10 pounds from the one meal, but it was worth it. Although this is not my favorite burger in town, I would like to make it back there soon and would recommend that you check them out!

I had the pleasure of attending the ISC UYE here a couple weekends back and was pleasantly surprised by the Thai buffet offerings. This place has a legit buffet with dish after dish of fresh Thai foods (and the employees continuously brought out fresh food). They had a tasty lemongrass soup, a delicious spicy chicken dish, and several tasty curries. Additionally, their eggplant was tender and perfect. They had all types of meat, noodles, tofu, soups, curries, and even vegetarian spring rolls... huge range. This place is fairly far from my house, but If I were craving a Thai buffet, I would certainly return!

Ok guys, here's the deal. It seems that a lot of people came in opening day and were turned off by the craziness. I get that. But give this place another try! I went here yesterday at around 4 (when they open) to check out their happy hour. Their happy hour is very good, it includes one special drink of the week (this week was a vodka based bramble with blackberry) for 6$ and a page of their 'market' cocktails for 6$ ( these include your choice of fruit in a caipirinha, collins, frozen marg, or mojito). You really can't beat that. Additionally, they have great beer specials (schlitz for 3$... the husband was happy), food specials (most items discounted), and the happy hour lasts until 7!!! Even on Saturday!! How awesome is that?   Now that that is settled, I will tell you about my experience. The husband and I went yesterday. We sat at their very pretty and large bar. The owner was mixing cocktails and came over, shook our hands, introduced himself, and was generally pleasant (and the accent... love it). I started with their lemongrass collins (not on HH, but it had ginger so I had to try it... 10$) - this is a solid drink. It is humongously large, gingery and fresh tasting. I was a fan. The husband got the white russian (which, like all of their classic cocktails can be made at 3 levels of booze quality - economy (10$), business class (or something else clever?) (12$), and first class (or something) (16$). He had the basic, and he liked it, but it wasn't his favorite russian ever. Anyway, then I had the special bramble (HH - 6$) - so delicious. I would definitely get this again. Then, against my better judgment, I ordered the tiramisu martini (12$). This thing was like dessert... chocolatey and creamy from the use of mascarpone cheese with a slight coffee and, of course, booze flavors... it was good stuff. At this point, I had certainly had enough and was feeling just fine. We left after paying our bill of about 40$... 40$ for 5 drinks is not bad guys... especially for hand crafted specialty cocktails. This is not your typical neighborhood bar, this is not applebees or wherever... it is not outrageous to ask 10$ for a drink. I encourage you to check this lovely new bar out, I will certainly be back!  PS I have now been back every week for like 2 months.... the cocktails of the week have been generally successful, with my favorites being the strawberry lemonade cocktail and the orange concoction... so good and dangerous... The people who work here are true professionals, the bartenders and owner recognize us, remember our interests so we can have good conversations, and are just generally friendly and down to earth people. They truly care about cocktails and you can tell by the way they talk about them. But the real reason I'll continue coming back.....  Ramen. Burger. This thing is legit. I told a bar mate (that I didn't know) that this burger tastes like pure joy.  It is messy and packs a ton of flavor. It is savory and has (I know this sounds ridiculous) umami flavors and some good spiciness... combine that with the crunchiness of the fried ramen bun.... you can't beat it.   Other food items here just don't compare... the pork belly is good, but if you eat the whole thing by yourself, it's too much of the same flavor, the fried chicken is also alright, but nothing crazy delicious. The smashed chips are very good (and a good deal on happy hour). The potatoes come out crispy and delicious with several sauces including a spicy sauce, a horseradish sauce, and a green herby sauce. It's overall a tasty dish. But seriously... just get the Ramen Burger, you'll be happy.

The husband and I had a late lunch here today and it was surprisingly lovely. I was a little nervous going in because the place was just about empty. Despite this, the food was clearly fresh and tasted good. I had the carne asada torta (10$) on the the waiter/bartender's recommendation and it was very tasty. The bun was soft, the meat was tender, and it had a charred jalapeno on it (which really made the sandwich). It came with papitos (fries) which were fairly standard. The husband had carne asada tacos (9$) which came with rice and beans. He really liked the beans (I thought it was just ok, but I'm not a big bean person). My one critique is that their chips and salsa costs 4$ and the salsa isn't very spicy at all.... I would hope that for 4$ you might get at least a couple varieties of salsa. Regardless, the food was good, the service was attentive, and the prices were maybe just slightly on the high side (I did see their dinner menu which is significantly more expensive, but seems to be more on the 'fancy' side). I would like to come back here for happy hour, you can't really beat 1$ tacos and half priced apps (like the cheese dip which sounded yummy).

I was very excited to hear that Royal was opening a location in downtown again! (Maybe it was my pleading at the other locations... I'd like to think so). Like the other Royal locations, this location is small and cozy feeling. The decoration is minimal, yet urban in feel with brick walls and hanging lights with exposed light bulbs. They also have their coffee roasting machine at this location, which (obviously) adds to the coffee shop feel. I had a cappuccino (which was delicious and expertly made) and the husband had an equally good latte. We also spent some time talking with the two nice guys who work at this location about record players, which was fun. The guys were personable, engaging, and made great coffee... what else could you want?

Pizza Studio is a great addition to the 'build your own/unlimited topping pizza' movement that seems to be sweeping Phoenix (or maybe the country... or maybe the WORLD!). The service here was great, very friendly and helpful. The concept (like many others in town) is you choose your crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings on your own personal pizza (11 inch thin crust). They have many options and seemingly limitless combos you can make. I had the rosemary herb crust with tomato and pesto sauces, mozz and goat cheese, garlic, tomatoes, roasted onion, roasted zucchini, bacon, basil, and arugula. It was extremely tasty and delivered to my table within 5 minutes. Also, it only cost 8$... and I brought half home... so a pretty great deal. How does it compare to other build your own joints in town? I would say much better than Fired Pie (both in flavor and selection) but not as good as My Pie (the one owned by Crust) which I thought had better overall flavor and gets points for being locally owned. Now, I would probably frequent Studio more than My Pie based on proximity to me. Regardless, if you're in the downtown area and feel like some quality personal pizza (and not some crappy Totino's), head to Pizza Studio!   PS They do validate parking for 2 hours PPS it's super weird that they don't have a phone so no calling this restaurant with questions... odd stuff.

Oh Doc's... you are good enough to break my general Yelp rules for (no 5 star on the first visit.... but this one earned it!). I've had Doc's bookmarked forever, so when a coworker wanted to take some students out on one of the last days of school, I had to suggest we try Doc's. This place is legit. We got super lost trying to find it.... it's unexpectedly in an industrial businessy looking plaza. Even when we were at the door I was having doubts that this was an ice cream parlor.... but it is. The owner and employees here were just amazing people. They were so patient and friendly with the students (and the staff!). They allowed us to try 5 and 6 flavors before deciding. They even gave me 4 different flavors in a large ice cream (which was only 5$...and I ate the whole thing....). The owner seems to have a lot of integrity- only using single source chocolate, in season fruits, whole fruits, high quality ingredients to make the gelato and sorbet. Speaking of sorbet... this was unlike any sorbet I have ever had. Their chocolate sorbet was better than the chocolate gelato! They make it with a coconut milk base and it is rich, flavorful, and surprisingly creamy! They had other fantastic flavors like salted caramel, two different peach flavors (white and yellow of course....), lemongrass and coconut, banana (don't knock it til you try it).... the list goes on and on. They don't offer toppings for their ice cream because, honestly, it doesn't need them...the ice cream shines on its own. I will be back and I would recommend Doc's to anyone and everyone!

Oh em gee.... ice cream heaven. The husband and I came here and shared the turtle sundae.... holy crap this was fab. It is caramel ice cream with whipped cream, salted caramel sauce, chocolate sauce, and pecans.... heaven. I want another right now. I'll be back.    PS they also have a bunch of fun and funky flavors I'll have to try in the future.

This was the first taco stop on last night's taco tour with Jon and Amy H. I must say, the tacos here were fairly legit. They allow you to taste all of the meats before ordering, which was a nice touch. Several of the meats were very spicy, and I appreciate that very much. I liked the cochinita pibil, the tinga chicken (surprisingly the spiciest, which is awesome cuz tinga can tend to be bland), and the green chili beef. The adobado was good too. The husband and I split the 5 street tacos (for 7$...Holy Deal!!) and got all the toppings on them. The salsas from the salsa bar added just the right amount of heat and flavor to make for some yummy tacos. I especially liked the light green salsa. The tacos were decently large and they were not stingy with any of the ingredients. Now, these aren't my favorite tacos ever, but they were the best of the night. Will be back!

I went to the Local tonight with the husband to celebrate my birthday (just the two of us). I must say, it was pretty awesome. The decor looks similar to when it was Scratch, but they moved the bar and got new furniture. It looks nice. The service was great, attentive and informative. We ordered a bunch of things to share including the pig ear pad thai, the gnocchi, and the brisket. The gnocchi was good, but nothing crazy amazing. It is one large gnocchi.... it had the consistency of a souffle almost and tasted good, but I don't think it's worth the 10$ price tag. The pad thai, on the other hand, was amazing! It had so much flavor, it was tangy, spicy, savory, but mostly it tasted extremely fresh. I loved every bite....yum. The brisket was also good, but a little on the fatty side (I know that's kind of the nature of brisket, but the way it was cut left a lot of fat on). The sauce was delicious and complemented the meat well. It was herby, a little citrusy, and tasted great. It came with brussels sprouts (which were nicely cooked and tasty), potatoes (which were cheesy , but nothing too special), and amazing onions... these onions were fabulous, not oniony....very sweet. They were unbelievable. Lastly, we had the chocolate tart.... this was a tasty dessert, but they should probably call it a peanut butter dessert...the peanut butter taste was far stronger than the chocolate, which you could barely taste at all. Despite this, it was a tasty dessert. I definitely would like to come back here to try their brunch and the other items on their menu.  Update: I have been back to the Local a couple times and it definitely has some highs and lows. The pig ear pad thai is consistently good. I have had drinks here a couple times and they are also good. I had a drink on their new happy hour when I went recently that was very tasty (I can't remember what it was called, but it was fruity with a touch of mint and was topped with a huge piece of citrus skin) and it was a decent deal at 6$ on special. We also had the brisket sliders (on our slider tour of phoenix) and I must say that they were ok, but nothing special. I wouldn't order them again. Further, the last time I went here, the service was terrible (incredibly slow, inattentice) and the DJ was playing music so loud, I couldn't even hear a conversation. I hope they can work out the kinks because it would be a nice place to catch happy hour.

I almost don't want to write this review because I want to hoard R2 for myself.... but I decided not to be so selfish and share these amazing ladies with the world. R2 consists of owners and photographers Robin and Renee, amazing ladies who have some insane talent. Seriously, check out their website, it is pretty wonderful. They have other associates who do photography and videography. We had Robin and Renee and a team of others capture our wedding and do an (included) engagement session (e sesh in R2 terms). The pictures are beautiful and modern. So much so that we have a bunch hanging in our house without it seeming too arrogant/lame... at least I don't think so anyway. Most of their work is fairly 'out of the box' or modern, but they certainly work with you and make your photos fit your personality. Robin and Renee spent a lot of time meeting with us to get to know us and understand what we wanted for both sessions. They made even our oddest requests happen (e.g. I wanted pictures of my sitting on the ground in an alley in my wedding dress... they made it happen.... we wanted pictures at the light rail and, despite almost getting in trouble with the federal police, they made it happen!). We just received our album today (and yes, they insist you get an album), and it is just wonderful. Very professional and artistic. I can see it being something we can display forever. Now, I can go on and on about their photography, but beyond that, they are really cool people and they make you feel like you are part of their family. They even put on yearly proms (which are freakin awesome). A lot of stuff didn't go the way I wished it had for my wedding, but this was the one thing that went perfectly. Check out their site and consider them for your next event or family pics or pictures just for fun.... you won't be sorry!

What a fun event! The husband and I got to bring our puppy out to enjoy puppy cupcakes, an inordinate amount of treats, and lots of attention for the pup. Us humans got to enjoy delicious food from Ben and Jack's steakhouse (mac and cheese and steak.... yes please!) and cupcakes from sprinkles while enjoying art and good company. Thank you Lindsey for another great event!

When I heard that Tacos Atoyac had closed, I was super disappointed since I had only been once and because it was so good. So when I heard they had reopened, you can imagine my excitement! I went back a couple days ago and it is very much the same as it was before. I had 2 fish tacos and a molote (which I have never tried or heard of). The molote was SO good! it is fried masa with potato and a little bit of chorizo inside with black beans on top.... super tasty stuff. The fish tacos were good, but I feel like they weren't as good as when I had gone before. This could be a fluke, but the fish just wasn't as light and crispy as it had been. Regardless, it still tasted good and the fish still tasted fresh. I will be back! Hooray!

This place was surprisingly delicious. They have an unassuming storefront in a little strip mall off 16th st North of Bethany. The husband and I met our friends (Erin B and her husband) at Urban Taco for happy hour on Saturday night and happy it was! Their happy hour offers $1.50 street tacos, 5$ margs, 5$ beers, and 1$ off salsa flights. We decided to get 8 (yes... you read right, 8) salsas, guac, and a vast array of tacos. The salsas were awesome, with the table coming to a consensus that the best were the chimichurri, chipotle, avocado, and habanero (which was not very spicy at all) and the ones we would pass on would be the corn and garlic (really odd flavor), the roasted tomato (nothing too special), and the cucumber (some liked it, but it wasn't overly flavorful). The guac also was nothing special, so maybe pass on that. I had a short rib taco (which was really good, the meat was tender and flavorful), the braised pork (also very tasty, but a little less so than the short rib), and the pork belly and potato (pretty yummy, like a mashed potato taco, but the belly didn't stand out). I tried the octopus taco, and it was good, surprisingly tender, but a little fishy for me. I had a marg and it was standard, but a good deal at 5$. Happy hour goes until 7, even on Saturday. Check them out, I know I'll be back!

I was extremely disappointed with Giada. I was so excited for them to open, I checked their website almost obsessively. When I found out that reservations were available on OpenTable, I made a reservation right away for the first time slot available (11 am on June 4th, made the res in early May). I spent the next couple weeks obsessively looking for the menu and reading all of the news articles about this restaurant. In one article, I noticed it said that they would not be open for lunch for the first month... this was a red flag for me, so I called the number provided to confirm that we would be able to go at the specified time. I was assured over the phone that it was fine. Great. So we get to Vegas and I get a confirmation e mail from OpenTable for my res... I am so excited, but still a little wary, so I went to the Cromwell's front desk to ask about our reservation... they don't know anything and give me the number of the restaurant (which isn't the number on their website). I call... no answer. I call several more times and finally get an answer. I just wanted to triple check that my res is still good.... oh no, not open for lunch. 'You made your reservation when we THOUGHT we would be open for lunch, but then we decided we weren't going to be.' WHAT?!?! I had invested so much time and energy into going to this restaurant.... I drove to Vegas for this. I could not believe it. Not only that, but the manager, Nicole I think, was less than helpful. First, they offered us a 5 o clock res for that night, which I snatched with renewed excitement... only to get a call back a couple minutes later saying that actually they couldn't give us that res since they had a private party until 730. WHAT. Let down all over again. Who has a private event on their opening night? I thought this was the night for the public. At this point, the manager said she couldn't do anything for us, that we could 'try to come sit at the bar.' Are you kidding me? This was unbelievably ridiculous. She couldn't even just save us a place at the bar considering they were the ones who messed up? How hard do I need to work to give this place my business? I think the worst part was if I hadn't been researching, I would have shown up for our res and no one would have been there... how crushing is that? How many people did this happen to? I hope this place works on its customer service because right now it is garbage. That, and don't give out reservations you can't keep and never bother to call those people or contact those people to tell them that their reservation had been cancelled. After this experience, I don't know that I will visit Giada in the future and I would be hesitant to recommend it to anyone else. I know it's a new restaurant and all, but get your act together.

I have been waiting with much anticipation for Mother Bunch to open, and am very happy to say they are a great addition to the downtown/Roosevelt area. I went with the husband yesterday for a pint and some wings. Upon entering, you can see that they put a lot of work into making this an open and neat looking space. The bar is in the center with tables all around it (including large tables that have church pews as the benches.... awesome!). They have many beers on tap, mostly local, all craft brews. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, she could see I was waffling on which beer to order and offered to bring a sample of the beer I was debating on. Not only did she bring the sample of the requested beer, but also a sample of another beer she thought I might like... how nice is that? I ended up getting the Deer Lord, which I have never had before, and liked it very much. The husband had the Scottsdale Blonde (and he liked that, ha). We received our wings quickly and it was a huge pile of wings. They had a good ratio of drumstick to wing (I don't know about you, but most everyone I know prefers the drumsticks and when a restaurant only gives you one or two, that can be a problem). The flavor of the wings was good, very different than most, very smokey. I do wish they had the same flavor but with added spiciness... they needed more kick in my opinion. Other than that, they were good. The waitress also sold me on the apple cake with salted caramel gelato and beer infused whipped cream (I'll admit, it was an easy sell). She told me it was one of her personal top 5 desserts in Phoenix. When it came out, the sheer size of this slice was daunting. It was a BIG piece of cake. But it was really delicious.... and we ate the whole thing.... we're pigs. It is a slice of an almost caramelized tasting cake with slices of apples on top, which was decent on its own, BUT when paired with the incredible gelato, it was a real winner. The gelato was fantastic, went well with the cake, and even had some bits of chocolate in it (which always helps). The beer whipped cream didn't taste too beer -y, but was delicious cuz... whipped cream...you know. Overall, the dessert was pretty fabulous. I would come back just for the dessert, but I would also like to try their other food items and their beer (once it's made available!). Will be back!  Update: I have been back twice - once for brunch and once for beer and mac and cheese. The brunch was fair, but we went on the first day they served it - I'm sure it will be wonderful once the kinks are worked out. It is a great deal though, 10-12$ for a meal and a beer or mimosa.... awesome! I got to try their house brew Saison, which was delicious.... it had a lot of spices in it, but was still light. The real star here, though, (other than the dessert) was the beer mac.... OH MAH Gawd...... That is some of the most delicious mac I have had in Phoenix. It has the perfect amount of beer flavor. I want to come back and just eat beer mac forever (ha). The price is also reasonable (8$), especially for the size of the portion. I will reiterate, will be back!

I am so happy I got a whole pizza from Focoso at the Local First event this past weekend... they were doing samples, but the husband and I wanted a whole pie. This was certainly the best pizza we have had out of a truck (and a great pizza in general). All pizzas are based on a margherita (so they have fresh mozz and basil) for 8$ and toppings are 1$ each. We had a pepperoni and it was pretty glorious. The pizza came out piping hot, with that nice somewhat blackened bottom on the crust... yum. They offer real parm to put on (none of that weird granulated stuff), which added a nice flavor as well. The crust was just crunchy/chewy enough, not overly crunchy or chewy and definitely not soggy. The tomato sauce was legit. Overall, it was a delicious pizza. I would seek this truck out, and you should too.

I am currently sitting at the bar of this lovely new restaurant and am happy to say that my butt is the first one to have officially sat here! Huzzah! This place has a few kinks to work out, as it is opening day, first seating, but it has some serious potential. The managers/ owners graciously allowed me to try a few of their cocktails on the house and all were tasty. The clear standout is the frozen coconut mojito! Extremely delicious. I also had the coconut drink, which was very pure in coconut flavor and the passionfruit drink (10$ normal price, 8$ hh) which was gingery and smokey and overall unlike anything i have had before. Plus this place has hard a on tap... Cool stuff. For food we trued the following:  dates wrapped in bacon - very tasty... How could it not be? It's a date with cheese and chorizo inside and wrapped in bacon on top of a foie gras sauce.... Come on!  chicken tacos- very flavorful but tiny... I would like more for sure!  traditional guac- flavorful and plentiful, but served with weird tostada type chips... Good tasting and clearly house made, but awkward to eat.  pollo chcharrones- so yummy with the  miso mustard... Nicely done!  this place is a definite return to place, reasonable prices, good drinks, nice hh, and interesting food (not to mention cute decor).   check it out yelpers!  ps, first!!

This is an extremely cute addition to the small center on Vernon and Central. The dining room looks like you are eating in someone's living room, which is great, and the decor is a mix of old and modern. They have many beers on tap and a good happy hour I would like to check out in the near future. The food was solid. The husband and I split the baked rigatoni and the margherita flatbread. The rigatoni was good, but tasted a bit like something you could make at home. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it was really fresh and tasty, but it makes it harder to go to a restaurant to get it (unless you don't cook, in which case it's great!). The rigatoni came with delicious fresh baked bread. It was a nice amount of food for the small price tag (9$). The flatbread was very good. It had a lot of fresh basil and was flavorful. It was also large, we even took some home (and it was good the next day!). I would definitely come here for the flatbread again. And did I see that it was gluten free? I don't even know how they did that... overall, this place was very good, I will be back!

Ehhhh I don't know about this. I was excited to have a new pizza place very close to my house, and that serves slices no less! So after a night out with some friends, the husband and I came here to get a couple late night slices. We arrived at the (very cute) pizza place sometime around 9, so not too long after they opened and ordered 3 slices, cheese, pepperoni, and a special (which was a white pizza with asparagus, bacon, and a few other toppings). It smelled good as we took it home. Unfortunately, the slices seemed old, like they'd already been sitting out a lot longer than they possibly could have if they had been made when the store opened. The crust was dry and stiff. The special pizza was especially bad, with a very flavorless white base atop the stiff cardboard like crust... it was not awesome. The cheese was significantly better since their sauce was alright, but still nothing amazing. Maybe their full pies are better (and more fresh), but I don't know that I'd come here for slices again.

On my most recent trip to Vegas, I stayed at the Jockey Club, which has access to the Bamboo pool at the cosmo. Score! This was a very nice pool, large with plenty of places to sit (including lounge chairs in the water... nice touch). They have a bar, but unlike many vegas pools, they did not have loud music, a DJ, or an excessive amount of people. All of these things were fine by me. The hot tub was also somewhat large and accommodated the number of people that were at the pool when we went in the morning (though it'd probably be more cramped later or if the pool was busier). The outdoor shower things were neat and a good way to cool off. I would come back for sure!

My mom and I got a salad from here on our way out of town. We definitely should not have. It took them quite a while to put the salad together, and the girl making the salad looked confused as to what went in it. Turns out, we were given the wrong dressing and other items on the salad were also not as described, but we were already on a plane, so nothing we could do about it. Plus the salad cost about 10$ and didn't even have meat in it. Pass.

I hate to rub it in for those who didn't attend this event, but this event was fabulous! You can't really go wrong with beer, candy, and movies. On top of that, they had Short Leash in their lot and we were able to bring the hotdogs into the theatre, which was a win. Once inside, we got our drinks from the extremely friendly and personable woman at the counter. She even kept my tab open for me so I could easily go get a second drink. The movie for this event was Raising Arizona, which is a classic. We had a great time at this event, loved Film Bar (so cute, I can't believe I hadn't been before!), and can't wait to come back! Thank you Lindsey for a wonderful night!

Meat candy! I finally got myself some meat candy! haha. Thanks to Cheryl B, I got to experience the BRI with 6-7 other people. The service here was fantastic, even with the size of our group, it was as if this restaurant had been here a long time (and I don't think it has...actually I don't know). I started with the made in house collaborazz raspberry beer, which was pretty delicious. I love when places brew their own beer, it doesn't get much better than that. For food, I had the burger with the fried egg and bacon on it, but subbed meat candy for the regular bacon (which they did for me at no cost!). It came with delightfully crunchy fries. This burger was large, juicy, spicy, sweet, and everything you could want from a burger. Was it on the pricy side? Yes. Was it worth it? Absolutely. I will be back!

As much as I hate to admit it, postino is good. The food is simple and basic and delicious. Why is it so good? It seems like it would be easy to make the items they sell here at home, but do I? No, I do not. I went with two other people and we shared many items. Bruschetta (of course), which is probably the best thing at postino, their soup of the day (which was a weird broth based potato soup...good, but not your typical soup), and the panini with bacon and chicken and magic sauce (ok ok not magic, but it seemed like it at the time)... This thing was so good. The best part? The leftovers were just as good as the original food. I'll be back.

What an amazing event! We had a fantastic preview.of the generous pour event at capital grill. We were able to try samples of six wines paired with delicious seafood and steak. Everything was top quality and we gained valuable knowledge regarding the food and beverages as well. Thank you to the capital grill and Lindsey for a wonderful evening!!

Who knew that Cuff also encompasses Zang's? Well... maybe a lot of people, but not me! The husband and I met another couple and their baby here for happy hour (mostly food, come on now). The happy hour has decent food specials, with many regular menu items 2-3$ off. I started with their version of a Moscow mule, which was ah mazing! So so good. They infuse Tito's with fig and add basil, serious legit drinkage. For food, I tried the deviled eggs... very tasty.... the burger - also super good topped with cheese and bacon, yum!, and the pulled pork sandwich - the only thing that was so so. The pulled pork was spicy, which I like, but didn't have much else in the way of flavor. I'd stick with the burger next time (or maybe some Chinese food, ha!). Their fries were also killer.... crunchy and seasoned perfectly. The service here was on point, we had to turn the waitress away from filling our waters. We will definitely be back!

I had never even heard of Cleo until I was riding the deuce from the strip to Fremont Street. I saw Cleo advertised outside the SLS casino and looked it up on Yelp. I was surprised that it hadn't come up in previous searches given its rave reviews. I knew I had to try it. My friend and I already had dinner plans , so we came to Cleo to try an appetizer and a dessert close to closing time. We had an amazing waitress who was friendly and gave great advice on what to order. We ended up getting the eggplant moussaka and the sticky toffee pudding. The eggplant moussaka was like heaven! The eggplant was tender, beautifully cooked. It had a good balance of richness from the cheese and acidity from the tomato sauce. This isn't the type of dish I would typically order, but this dish inspired me to try moussaka again. The dessert was also on point, but maybe not quite as good as the eggplant. The sticky toffee pudding was served warm with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream and a tasty sauce on the bottom of the plate. The next time I'm in Vegas I would like to try a full meal at this restaurant. It was definitely worth the somewhat high price point.

Let me start by saying this place has serious 5 star potential (in fact, I may be going back next week, so I will update).   The husband and I came here for happy hour and it was ridiculously awesome. I had been here when it was Mabel's, and not much has changed here in the way of decor. Additionally, I think they kept some of the same or similar menu items. Anyway, we sat at the bar and the bartender (Meagan I think...) was awesome. She was just the right amount of friendly and attentive without being invasive. I tried their punch of the day (5$ on HH) which was a ginger beer, hibiscus, vodka, and lemon concoction that was absolutely incredibly delicious. I also tried a drink off their regular menu (6$ on HH) that was pimm's, ginger beer, and some other ingredients, which was good, but not as good as the punch. The drinks were full sized, so it was a pretty smokin deal. The husband got the magic hat beer... so good... it was like a mix between a pale ale and a hef. We also shared the mac and cheese (4$ on HH). This thing was legit delicious. It was a huge bowl for 4$ and was garlicky... almost like an alfredo. I would love to eat this again. I will definitely be back!!

I have to wonder if all of the current reviews were from employees because this was not at all what I was expecting. I met a friend here thinking It would be a cool new bar with a great happy hour. This is a straight up hotel bar with no atmosphere. Not only that, but their bar lights were flickering the whole time, which was really off putting. The staff at the bar had no idea what was on their happy hour menu... the one online? Not the real menu. I had wanted the delicious sounding specialty drink they had advertised on their website, but that drink didn't exist, or at least the employees working had no idea what I was talking about when I asked about said drink. Not only that, but I'm fairly certain the 'bartenders' were just regular hotel employees with no training in bartending. I ordered a sangria ( which on their menu detailed all of the 'pressed juices' and different ingredients)... it literally was poured from a premade mix bottle straight. It tasted fairly horrific, overly sweet and almost undrinkable. My friend got a margarita, which tasted like straight cheap tequila, no freshness to be found. Both were extremely unpleasant. Originally, I had wanted to try some food, but there was no way. So maybe the food is good, but I wouldn't return to find out.

Oh Em Gee. This was such an amazing and fabulous event! I got my behind thoroughly kicked at Orange Theory and then had amazingly delicious food from the super sweet and awesome people at Flower Child - gotta remember to go back there, it was pretty awesome. Let me start with Orange Theory - I was nervous going into it as I am not a runner (haven't run since... I dunno.... April maybe) and I don't lift weights typically. I was right to be scared, this place is not messing around. I was sweating and panting... it was almost a little embarrassing, but so good! I started on the treadmill (for 30 minutes.... I was dying), where they talk you through intervals of running and jogging. That was followed by the rowing machine and a series of simple exercises using mostly everyday equipment (dumbbells, push ups, sit ups with medicine balls, etc). The burn was real. I burned almost 500 calories... which was good cuz I ate at least that much after at Flower Child. I hadn't tried this place yet, but it was legit. The food is mostly local, organic, and lightly seasoned as to let the flavors of the food shine through. The people who worked there were so helpful in navigating the menu and so generous with the food. I had a great green tea, the amazingly delicious avocado hummus (I wanted to lick the bowl), and the sesame beef bowl (this thing had a great Asian flavor without obscuring the taste of the vegetables and the high quality steak). It was also huge, at least 2 meals worth. I got to try their delicious carrot/veg juice (I could get down with that on a regular basis), their green juice (good, but standard green/kale juice), and the kombucha (surprisingly good... never tried it before so I have no comparison). I'm not gonna lie, I totally drank some of the unfinished juices from friends (thanks guys!). We even got dessert to take home. The best part, though, was the friendly and personable nature of the staff... it really was impressive. I will be back! Thank you Lindsey and Yelp for an amazing day, you guys are the best!!!

This shop screams cute..... cute cute cute. It's like a bakery on a movie set, I kid you not. I walked by the shop after lunch and, despite being totally full, I just couldn't not go in... the vintage -y decor and neatly displayed pastries called out to me.... I was doomed. The people who work here are very nice, helpful, and friendly. Their recipes are mostly Italian based, which makes them a little different than other local bakeries. After much deliberation (and I mean MUCH.... like extensive), I tried the brownie and the cheesecake. The brownie looked kind of dry on the outside, but don't let that fool you, it was somewhere between a cake texture and a fudgy brownie texture, certainly not dry. The brownie was chocolatey but not overly rich with chocolate chips throughout. Was it my favorite brownie in town? No (I am partial to a fudgy more chocolatey and rich brownie). But it was very good and if I were in the neighborhood I would get it again. The cheesecake, on the other hand, was fairly awesome. This was no New York cheesecake. It was surprisingly light and airy, not the heavy oh-my-god-I'm-so-full-need-bigger-pants kind of cheesecake you get most places (not that I don't like that too, this was just something you may want to eat with more frequency). It was sweet without being overly sweet and they didn't complicate it with toppings or flavors, it was just a good plain cheesecake. Oh, and it isn't served in slices, it's served like a cupcake.... so cute. Anyway, each dessert cost 3$, so the prices are competitive with other local bakeries. Definitely check this cute little bakery out next time you're in the area.   PS they have cupcakes and the flavors change depending on the baker's mood each day.... how cute is that?   PPS Can I say cute one more time? Whoa.

After wanting to try the original Orange Table for a long time (and not doing so for whatever reason), I was glad to try the new location. First of all, OT allows you to make reservations through Yelp.... that's so cool! I made a reservation for 10:30 on Super Bowl Sunday, thinking this place would be insane... turns out they were fairly empty, so the res was unnecessary, BUT it was nice to have the piece of mind. The restaurant itself is cute, it has interesting paintings on the wall, it has a large orange table (that makes sense, right?), and a nice bar. We were greeted at the door by (possibly) the owner? It was nice, they opened the door for us and were extremely friendly. We had a great waiter (Josh), who was attentive and helpful. They serve their coffee in giant saucers... which is fabulous! Oh, and this bowl'o'coffee was never empty! For food, I had the benedict OT style (at Josh's rec), this is a benedict with chorizo and avocado. The husband had the banana pecan pancakes. The benedict was legit... the hollandaise was tasty, the eggs were cooked perfectly, the chorizo complemented the dish nicely... only problem was the dish didn't have a lot of texture, but that was a mild issue. The potatoes that came with this dish were also tasty and served with onions and peppers... yum. The cakes were also very tasty, the batter tasted home made and the bananas and pecans added great flavor and texture. The prices here are a bit on the high side, but the quality make it worth it. The pancakes were 12$, but they came with bacon, so it really wasn't a bad deal. I will definitely be back, thanks OT!

There's not a ton I can say about this place as I came here at night and there was a limited selection- I got an almond croissant (no chocolate ones available), but it was fabulous! It was flaky, rich, flavorful, and overall fantastic. I want to come back for more pastries and especially for the chocolate croissant.... yes please. Prices are average. I'll be back.   PS this place is by the AMC theatre.... back side of the building that houses fat tuesday and the like.....

I am a fan of the Whining Pig. Big fan. This place is just like its sister, but it has draughts, grilled cheese, and classic video games... awesome! The happy hour prices here are slightly higher than at WP, but it's still a great deal. The bartender suggested a delicious beer that was just what I was looking for, so I appreciated that. All of the video game tables were occupied, so I'll have to get my Mortal Kombat on another time (of which I am sure there will be many), but I did get to enjoy some Pop Up Pirate and Battleship. Will be back, yay!

All I can say is wow!   Ok, that isn't all I can say, but wow, this place was extremely good, especially for a brand new restaurant. They already have it together. The decor of this restaurant is cute, they have a wall covered in 8 tracks and everything has a 70's vibe. I said the bathroom was like the Jetsons because it is decorated with 70's flair, but has all modern technology (I don't think I had to touch a handle or button in the place...).   More importantly, the food was very good and made with local ingredients. I had the breakfast sandwich (at the waitress's recommendation, go waitress!) and it was pretty fabulous. Melt in your mouth short rib that is bursting with flavor served with an over easy egg (that's the way it comes! I know!), tomato jam for a savory and slightly sweet touch, all served on a soft sweet bun. Absolutely wonderful! It came with a small portion of nicely cooked potatoes with peppers and onions (which were especially good when put on the sandwich). The husband had the pancakes, which tasted homemade.... and not 'homemade' from a box. The portion was huge, 3 giant pancakes... he couldn't finish them.   Service was good, though the waitress couldn't tell me what kind of coffee they use (it was pretty good, though) and asked if we wanted cream, 1/2 and 1/2 or milk.... we said cream and got milk (ha!), but little things like that will get ironed out I'm sure. The prices here were fairly steep, breakfast was over 30$ with tax and tip, but the quality warranted (to some degree) the price (plus they bring out the check inside of an old book.... that definitely softens the blow of the price, ha!).   I can't wait to come back and try their other menu items, including lunch and late night!!

I came to Tapacubo with a friend awhile back for happy hour and was pleased with their offerings. The service was very good, with our waitress giving good honest opinions to help us order. I ended up getting 3 tacos - a cochinita, a fried fish, and a short rib. All were tasty, but I liked the two meat options better than the fish. I liked that there were several different salsas, but none of them were terribly special. Overall, the food was good, the portions were large, and the prices were pretty standard. I also had the ginger based marg, which was very tasty, while my friend had the cheapest standard marg, which was horrific... I wouldn't recommend it at all. Anyway, I could see myself visiting Tapacubo again in the future.

Ohhhhhhh mah god. This place is that good.    Let me start by saying I was mad at this place.... I tried their food at Scottsdale Spice and thought I was going to die. Their 'hot' sauce turned out to be one of the hottest sauces you can get... it was so hot, I couldn't taste for about 30 minutes... it hurt.... so I was not so thrilled.   Anyway, in hind sight, I decided that they were true to the festival and brought the heat and in the nature of being a good sport, I decided to come out to a UYE here tonight with a small group of Yelpers. I am so glad I did. This food was phenomenal. I had the hush puppies (3$ for about a thousand of them), which had jalapeno inside and were little fried balls of joy. I tried a grilled oyster... never had this before... it was so fantastic. Garlicky and wonderful. There aren't many places where I would actually order oysters, but this is now added to my list. For my meal, I had the fried cod po' boy (7$.... yes you read right... and this thing was big enough for 3 meals) with a side of the 'trifecta' sauce at a level 3 spiciness. This was damn good... spicy, without being too spicy. The fish was flavorful without being fishy. The bread was soft and delicious. The fries it came with were crunchy and spiced perfectly. This place has some serious 5 star potential pending a second visit (which should happen in the near future). Definitely recommend!!!   PS they have Abita beer here, which was good, and the service was fantastic... these guys really took care of us. Thanks guys!

A friend and I were out checking out happy hours due to a late dinner reservation elsewhere. We decided to check out the Upton, only to find out we missed happy hour! Tragic... Anyway, the place was hopping and we were lucky to get a couple seats at the bar. We tried a couple cocktails, with mine being the best - it was a light and refreshing drink with cucumber in it... yum. We also tried the ribs - these things were so good! The portion was huge, the flavor was bold and delicious, and the meat was falling off the bone. I wanted to have more food, but couldn't because of our dinner plans. I will definitely return, next time for happy hour!

Last Saturday night, when downtown was totally crazed with super bowl goers, I decided to avoid all of that and check out this new (ish) place in the midtown (ish) area. What a cute bar! It reminded me of the Whining Pig, but large and with cocktails. The bar had tons of games (that always makes for a good time), a small beer list, and a sizable cocktail list including cocktails on tap... very cool. The husband loved their manhattans on tap and I liked their special cocktail of the month (possibly) which was a play on a main tai (on tap) and loved their take on a mule.... mmmm, mule. We also shared the loaded fries.... these things were so good... I mean, how could they not be? They're delicious, hot, crispy fries covered in melty cheese, real bacon (no bacon bits), sour cream, and green onions... so good. We ate every drop. I will definitely be back and suggest you check it out as well!   PS Park in the back!

I cannot believe I came here and did not get the brussels sprout nachos!!! I totally spaced it (possibly due to the copious amount of drinks that were imbibed on this particular night). Anyway, I guess that's a reason to return sooner rather than later. Diego Pops was a fun little restaurant with excellent service. A friend and I went around 9:30 at night, and they were semi busy, but not crazy. We ordered the chips and salsas.... the salsas were all delish. It was fun to eat the chips with the 4 or 5 different salsas. We also tried 4 different tacos, and all were tasty with the fried fish being the most  underwhelming and the pineapple pork and machaca being the tastiest. All were fairly good and large! The one drink we tried was the guava coconut because....well... it's served in a coconut!!! The drink itself was just ok, but it added to the experience. I would LOVE to come back for happy hour the next time I find myself in Scottsdale.

I stumbled upon this place last night while walking around the Grand Ave Festival. This is a cute coffee house tucked away in the third space building. The barista was friendly and made a mean latte. Also, they use Morning Bell coffee (roasted just two doors down... and a delish coffee they sell at the Phx Public Market on Sat morning) . This coffee is legit, smooth, not acidic, flavorful. The whole package. Anyway, I also found out that they sell thrifty ice cream, so needless to say, I will be back!

I have had 3 donuts from Welcome Chicken and Donuts. The extremely flavorful salted caramel bun type thing.... got this around opening day, and it was legitimately tasty. The second time, I tried the blueberry cheesecake and the chocolate cacao. Both were insanely good, even better than the salted caramel. The chocolate cacao had dense white cake donut with dark chocolate icing... so good. The cheesecake blueberry was also delicious... a little savory, a little sweet, and all tasty. I will certainly be back to try more donuts and try the chicken!

Let me start by saying this place will most likely be a 5 star in my book, but I need a second visit before I make that decision. The first time I tried to come to Couscous express I was very concerned, it was 45 min or so before closing time and they were all locked up... we thought maybe they had gone out of business! Luckily for me, they must have just closed early that day. So a couple weeks later, I decided to give it another shot, but to come in earlier this time. I met Jon H, Norm, and Monica O here for linner.   This place was ridic! The people who work here (owners?) are so nice and accommodating. They started us off with two types of bread, one small round fluffy bread and one larger more dense bread and one of the best hummus type dips I've had.... a little spicy and packed with flavor. They also brought out delicious mint iced tea to sip and even a second hot sweet tea to try... both of which were great. For my entrée I got the beef tagine, which was huge! It had the beef and a bunch of veg (potatoes, dates, other delicious stuff) all served boiling hot in a tagine. With this came a huge amount of couscous. The meal was incredibly tasty, the couscous was light, fluffy, and delish... I could only eat a small amount, but was given a to go box and ended up making this one meal into 5 (the husband had some when I got home, and I had it for lunch, dinner, and then another lunch). We were then offered a date shake... so good... sweet, but not too sweet. They also brought out some fried honey cookie things, which I ate despite being ready to burst.  Take home point:  I have been raving to anyone who will listen about this restaurant and need to make my triumphant return to up this great place to a 5 star level. Will be back soon!

Ugh... I have had the food at humble pie in the airport and it was fine, but way overpriced. On this visit, I was drawn in by a menu stating a glass of sangria was 7$... Definitely as cheap as I would get a drink in this part of the airport. I ordered a glass and it was fairly mediocre. Got the bill...  It cost 9$... What the... I asked for the menu again, apparently they changed the price on most of the menus using pen or marker, but not the one I had seen. There was no way for me to prove it, so I sadly paid for the crappy drink and was on my way. I'll go elsewhere next time.

Let me start by saying that I am a Fez fan from the old location. I was excited to try the new location last Saturday night after walking around downtown with all of the Super Bowl festivities, dance parties and general fun going on. We were hungry and it was about 9:30pm. We entered Fez's new location, and it was gorgeous! The decor is very cool and modern. We were seated on their beautiful patio, which has individual heaters over many of the tables.... nice touch. This is where things went south. We sat and waited....and waited.... and waited. A table next to us literally got drinks, ordered a dessert, ate a dessert, and paid and we STILL hadn't gotten any attention.... no one came by to give us even water. It was like we were invisible. And don't be fooled, they were not slammed.... the patio was maybe half full and had two servers working it. After waiting and trying to get the attention of one of the waiters, we decided to leave... obviously they didn't want our business. We walked out with one of the waiters from the patio who had no idea that we hadn't had any service at all and still didn't acknowledge us. This was too bad because I really like the food at Fez (at least at the old location, didn't taste anything here). This makes me think twice about coming back here.

I was so excited to try this lovely new restaurant. I was worried I wouldn't have an opportunity to try it, as it's only open for lunch Monday through Friday (and I generally work those days far far away), BUT they were open for MLK day... huzzah! I went in at about 1:30 and was surprised by how cute this place is set up. It's tiny, but this is kind of neat because you can see their beautiful oven, all the fresh loaves of bread, and many of the local ingredients they sell and use in this establishment. Unfortunately, when we got there they were out of the two items I wanted to try - the smorgas and the soup.... oh man! Next time I'll have to come earlier. The husband and I ended up sharing the roasted beet salad and the little miss BBQ turkey sandwich. The salad was divine.... the husband even liked the beets and he HATES beets. They were so tender and sweet... delicious. The dressing was light, but perfectly seasoned. It had small sections of citrus in it that added a bit of acid... it was great. The sandwich was also wonderful. The turkey was smokey and delicious, the cheese was creamy, the bread was very flavorful  and the perfect amount of crunchy and chewy in texture. The sandwich had wonderful peppers on it that added another level to the flavor of the sandwich. It was certainly one of the best turkey sandwiches I have ever had. The sandwich came with an apple and an olive (maybe they ran out of something? not sure). The only problem? For the prices, the portions were a bit small... I don't know if it was because it was the end of their shift, but it was a very light meal for the price. Will I be back? Yes, of course. It was delicious. Would I like a touch more food? Maybe a protein in the salad (for 9$ especially), yes, that would be nice. Also, pretty please open one day on the weekend??? See you on the next holiday!

Here's the deal- I stopped in here for a drink with a friend, we did not end up eating, so I cannot comment on the food. My friend and I sat at the bar and immediately felt uncomfortable. The crowd here was definitely the older single crowd desperately trying to find someone. We were just looking to get a quality drink and hang out. The music was on very loud for a bar/restaurant, so loud we could barely talk. We each had a drink and both were mediocre at best. I had their pimm's cup, which was probably the worst Pimm's cup I've ever had. It lacked the refreshing and sweet quality that makes for a good pimm's. My friend had a gin and tonic with fruit... except it was all gin and one slice of fruit.... it was almost undrinkable. The scene and the drinks were not really my thing... I don't think I'd be back, especially not on a weekend night.

After wandering around the pre superbowl festivities last Saturday night in downtown Phoenix, I found myself at the public market dancing and hungry! I decided to walk around to see what food trucks were there, when I saw I truck I had never seen before. It had no visible name, but there... right on the menu... I saw 'juicy pork dumpling.' Could it be?!?! Yes... it was in fact xiao long bao..... my dreams had come true. I got about 8 large pieces of xiao long bao for 9$ and ate every one.... they were good, not the juiciest I had ever had, but the flavor was there. If I could buy these dumplings off of this truck again, I certainly would. In fact, can this truck just park outside my house and serve xiao long bao all of the time? That'd be greeeeeat.   PS The truck had a gong on it.... and they let me hit it (!!!).... bang bang indeed!

What a cute coffee shop right in the middle of downtown Chandler. The look of this coffee shop screams hipster, from the darkness of the paint to the industrial look of the shelving and bar, the atmosphere is definitely there. I had wanted to stop in for a long time, but don't frequent the chandler area, so when I happened to be in the neighborhood, I knew I had to stop. The service here was incredible, I asked about the coffee and the girl at the counter took her time to explain each item and helped me figure out what I would like to order. I ended up ordering a cortado. Their coffee tasted... different than typical coffee, much more fruity. I'm not sure it's the way the coffee is roasted or where the coffee is from, but it was distinct from your typical coffee. That being said, I didn't love it, it didn't fill my desire for traditional coffee BUT I would recommend that anyone give it a shot, because I could see many people really enjoying it.

This place was so good I came here twice in one day (I know, I'm a sick human, but to my credit once was while waiting for friends and once was with said friends). It's about time the east valley got a truly delish coffee location. This place roasts their own beans (kudos!) and spends ample time making their coffee drinks. The space is cute, warm, and comfortable with a variety of seating options (tall chairs, short benches), especially for their small space. They feature their coffee roasting equipment in the space, which is neat to see. The barista I spoke with was knowledgeable about their coffee and tea. I ended up getting a dirty chai and it was extremely tasty. The only issue is it did take a long time to get my drink, and when I came back with friends it also took quite some time. So why no dock in stars? Because I feel that they used the extra time to make all of the drinks meticulously. I can't fault them for that. I will definitely be back!   PS they have wonderful looking breakfast options here...next time!

What an interesting little coffee shop.... Let me start by saying the people who work here are awesome! They are super friendly and helpful. I've been wanting to check Velo out for awhile, but never made it in until recently. The Velo specializes in a drink that involves putting a shot of espresso in a coconut. This was a very tasty and surprisingly satisfying drink. I also tried their 'shakerato.' What the *** is that, you may ask. Well.... it's pretty much sugar and espresso served cold.... you can add a little milk if you like. It was very tasty! I would definitely go back for this drink. Check this place out, you won't be sorry!

Conveyor belt sushi FTW! I like the conveyor belt concept because it allows you to take the risk of trying weird stuff without committing to a whole roll. They did a good job of keeping the hot food hot and the cold food cold on the belt. I must've eaten 3 plates of gyoza... they were mighty tasty. The sushi was decent, not wonderful, but not bad. They have an extensive menu you can order from if you don't see what you want on the belt. We got a sweet potato roll which was.... weird. Anyway, we were stuffed and I paid about 22$, that's fantastic! We'll be back.

Hooray for Norm, my best restaurant scout! I've been wanting to go to Irma's for awhile and when I went, I was nothing short of impressed. The husband and I went for brunch. I had the chilaquiles Christmas style with over med eggs. He had the lunch special with a beef tamale and a cheese enchilada. Both were super tasty. They brought out chips and salsa first, which was fresh and surprisingly spicy (in a good way). My chilaquiles were delish... spicy, flavorful, great with the beans and the eggs... even the little unnecessary salad was good and added nice flavor to the dish. The husband's food was equally tasty, the tamale was wonderful with tender meat inside and complimented by their red sauce. The prices were ridic low. We will be back!

Ohso has a great concept... Giant patio, booze, brewery, games... You really can't lose with that combo. I came to this location for a party, and it was nice. I tried many of the apps.... All decent. The cheese sauce? Mmmm. I had the steak fries for my entree and this thing was huuuuge! The flavors were delicious and the steak seemed to be high quality. The cocktails were fairly tasty. I would return.

I am not a great judge of this restaurant, as I only had the pork bao; however, I will say it was quite tasty. I had one pork bao at happy hour (3$), a tasty and juicy pork/veg filled light and sweet bun. It was varied in flavors, temperature, and texture. It was overall tasty. My issue is when it is not happy hour, 2 of these suckers cost about 10$.... pretty steep for what you get. Anyway, check them out for HH!

This is serious 5 star materials, I just need to have a second wonderful visit to bump it up. I came here with my mom and the husband for my birthday and it was definitely a great choice. This little restaurant is super cute, kind of rustic in decoration, but comfortable. We got many items to share and I don't think I had a bad bite all night. We started with wine, which is a bit odd since they just say 'red or white' and give you some random wine, but it was fine. The service was good, I believe we were waited on by an owner and he spoke mostly Italian to us all night... that's kind of fun. For food we shared the 301 salad (amazing tangy and flavorful dressing, goat cheese, heaven) and 3 pizzas (margherita - very good basic pizza, the one with onion and sausage... really  tasty and fresh, and the best one - prosciutto.... so fresh and delicious, I want another right now!). All of the pizzas were simple and fresh and had a wonderful thin, but firm crust... I think I ate 10 slices haha. My mom was impressed because when she asked for oregano, they came out with beautiful whole leaf dried oregano (no flaky shake stuff)... it was awesome. For dessert, they graciously brought out a flourless chocolate cake, which was rich and delicious, and we ordered the tiramisu, which was served in a jar and was one of the best tiramisus I have ever tasted.... creamy, rich, espresso -y, chocolaty goodness.... I licked the jar. I will be back!!!

This is another place that wasn't what I expected it to be. I was thinking this place was a sit down restaurant, but it is actually a counter service kind of place. The place is cute, but somewhat plain in decoration. For food, I tried the salad with the special greek cheese (not feta, something else I hadn't heard of before) and the George pizza with sun dried tomatoes, chicken, garlic, and various other toppings. The salad was very tasty, I enjoyed the creamy dressing and felt that the veggies were fresh. The cheese was tasty and the portion was large. The pizza was just ok... again, the portion was generous, but the flavor was nothing terribly special. I would like to come back to try the chicken pita in the future.

Typically I won't give 5 stars on a first visit, but because this is just a relocation, I think it is ok. Songbird is awesome. Their coffee is tasty and the new location is adorable. I like that there's parking in the back and a large patio out front. I came here the other day with a friend and we hung out inside. The inside space is a little small, but not uncomfortably so, and the décor is adorable. My latte was, dare I say, even better than ones I have had in the past at the old location.... it was a fairly perfect latte - smooth, creamy, strong without being too strong... it was great. My friend also enjoyed her iced vanilla latte. Of course, I will be back!

I was lucky enough to come here with the Breakfast Club UYE. This new breakfast place in the old American Junkie space has transformed into a light and welcoming restaurant. The food was a little expensive and the menu was, at times, inaccurate (I ordered the loco moco (points for having this!) which said it came with two eggs and two beef patties, but only came with one of each... now, I would only want one of each, but it should be served as stated on the menu). The loco moco was really flavorful, and, I'll admit, I ate the whole thing. The husband had the pancakes, which were large, but a bit dense... not bad, but not great. They did come with a bowl of fruit though, which was a huge plus. I would definitely come back (though I did hear they were closed until Aug 1st for some reason?).

Here is what you need to know. 4$ giant bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun. Happy hour.   For real, this burger is delicious... onions soaked in wine, cheese, spicy ketchup, tomato.... insanity. I ate half and took half home, ate it 2 days later and it was still amazing.   As for the rest of the place, the drinks are alright, the happy hour includes a 5$ cocktail of the day, which is a decent deal. The space is beautiful and the concepts inside have all been fairly good (except the coffee shop, not my fave). I'll definitely be back here for happy hour- I believe it's mon-fri from 4-7, but don't quote me. Enjoy!

I was pretty impressed with Radish. They have a great looking menu with many interesting salads. I went opening day and the service was spot on as if they had been there months. I ordered the south by southwest salad on staff recommendation, and was impressed with the quality and freshness of the ingredients. The chicken was smoky and tasty, the cheese complimented it nicely.... and... oh ya, there were vegetables. The dressing was also very tasty. I also had their kale juice, which I thought might be a little gross, but it was surprisingly tasty! I'll be back!

Let me start by stating the obvious. This place is far away. This may be prohibitive as it is a place to drink alcohol. Regardless, the beers were surprisingly tasty! I thoroughly enjoyed their s'more beer ( dark, yet somewhat sweet) and their wit ( fruity and light). The theme is amazing, they even have old school gaming consoles at their tables for entertainment. Further, the service was friendly and accommodating. If you are anywhere near avondale, Check out 8 bit!

Hooray for new coffee! Well, let me say, new coffee shop, as they use an established local roaster for their beans (Cortez I think). This shop is large, very large, and has a giant case of pastries. I have been twice, the lattes have been delicious both times (or maybe once I got a cortado?) and the pastries have ranged from omg amazing to very good. The first time we came, I got the espresso brownie.... took it home, ate it 1-2 days later.... I thought I had died it was so delicious. Just rich chocolate with walnuts and pecans.... trust me, it was great. The next time, I had the nutella pie, which was good, but heavy on the whipped cream and brought another brownie home. Ate it the next day.... not as good as the first go around, but good. I'll definitely be back.

After hearing of the opening of a new coffee shop in town, I had to stop in to try the brew (as part of my ongoing coffee tour of Phx!). Unfortunately, the day we went in, their AC was out...fortunately, it wasn't THAT hot... Anyway, the space is super cute and comfortable, I think you could hang out here comfortably doing work or hanging with friends. They use Altitude coffee roasters (based in Scottsdale) and have a ridic list of specialty coffee drinks. The husband got a latte, which was tasty, maybe not my favorite in town, but good. I got the dulce de leche latte (or something to that effect) which has sweetened condensed milk and caramel... very tasty, like dessert. Anyway, the place has a drive through, so that's convenient. I would definitely try this place again!

What an awesome addition to downtown Phoenix! I went on a Monday when they not only have 1$ off draft beers, but also have free games! This includes skee ball, darts, pool, shuffleboard, and board games. We got the lucha libre ale (which was not wonderful, but did cost 2$ a pint (1!)) and had fun playing games all evening. The bar is adorable, with metal trains, cacti, and other AZ type things going around in circles overhead and being projected onto a sheet of sorts (that description was terrible, but it's really neat and you'll just have to go look at it for yourself). The cocktails look tasty, so I'll have to check them out sometime soon.    PS the entrance is in the alley behind the building.... took us awhile to figure that one out.

Tea sandwiches.... bruschetta.... adult beverages.... can it get better than this? This event was a lot of fun. We got to learn how to make several cocktails (all with Gin) and then enjoy said cocktails. Each one was good in its own way. The cocktails were tasty and the recipes were fairly easy, making it perfect to replicate at home.... and replicate I will! Thanks to Hendrick's for this fabulous night!

I'm not sure if there's something wrong with me, if it was an off day, or if everyone else has low donut standards, but I didn't think these donuts were all that. The husband and I excitedly drove up to Northern Perks on a Sunday morning to get some (supposedly) delicious donuts and coffee. We arrived and immediately felt a little disappointed... the shop itself was nothing terribly special and the case of donuts didn't have much out of the ordinary either (at least these days when many other donut shops are stepping up their creativity game) . The husband got a fruit loops donut, I got a cronut, we got the bacon maple to go and a coffee. Let me say, the ladies who work there were very nice and helpful.    Here's the rundown:  Coffee- they have a few different varieties. The husband got the regular coffee and poured 'cream' in it from the carafe. Unfortunately, I don't think it was cream ( or milk)  as the coffee looked like it had chunks of white stuff in it, I thought possibly bad milk... it was pretty gross looking, but the husband said it tasted ok and he thought maybe it was just coffee mate powder mixed with water. Either way, not having cream or milk out for coffee is ridiculous.   Cronut - this thing was greasy and the filling was flavorless.... the redeeming quality? the strawberry on top... but there was only one slice... and it didn't save this dessert. This is a sad version of what could be so good.   Bacon maple - Also greasy, left a weird taste in your mouth... wasn't nearly as good as bacon maples from other local establishments (see Welcome Donut, Oink, etc).    So, I'm not sure if it was a bad day, which I hope it was, but I'm also not sure I'll be back to find out.

I came here for brunch this morning (their first brunch service) and was shocked at how great everything was! How I didn't notice this place going up is beyond me as I drive by many times a week, but I didn't. This place is HUGE, like a compound almost. They have a huge yard/patio, the restaurant with a bar, a separate bar, and a separate coffee bar. The buildings were mostly made of old shipping containers, which was super neat. I went with a meetup group and the restaurant was very accommodating for our (very) large party.    For food, I had the brioche with red eye gravy and bacon and also got to try the cast iron pancake and the breakfast chimichanga. Out of all I tried, I felt like my brioche was the best item. The  bread itself was sweet and played well with the savory gravy, crispy bacon, perfectly sautéed greens, and runny egg. The pancake was giant and tasty, topped with fruit compote. The chimi was also a large portion, that looked perfectly crispy. Unfortunately, I think they preroll these things because they can't change the contents of the burrito, but the flavor was decent. This was probably my least favorite of the three. Needless to say, I will definitely return to this restaurant for brunch, booze, and other meals!

I came here on a Saturday around 4:30 and was able to score a seat at the bar. Huzzah! The establishment itself is cute, decorated in a minimalist/hipsterish way. The lady who was working the bar was friendly and helpful. She allowed me to try a few beers before making a decision as to what I wanted. I tried a variety of beers, the porter, the stout, the wheat beer...the wheat beer tasted almost IPA ish and I didn't care for it. The porter was tasty and I ended up ordering that. The atmosphere was relaxed and they had games available. I would return.

I was a little wary of this place, given that I came here on a rainy night and there was no one here besides my party, but it turned out to be very good! The place isn't much to look at, a small storefront in a fairly dead plaza. They have a big TV on the counter (very old school). I came with my dad and step mom and we ordered two things to share, the vegetarian sampler and the fim tibs. We weren't sure if this would be enough, but we ended up having leftovers! The vegetarian plate was good, there were many different items on the plate, and, honestly, I don't know what many of them were, but they were all tasty. The fim tibs (beef with onion and jalapeno) was ridiculously tasty. It was served in this contraption that had a fire inside, keeping the beef and veggies sizzling hot for the whole meal! The beef was so frickin tasty, I want some more right now. They also gave us some spicy powder... add that to the mix and you're set. I would definitely come back!

I was so excited to try this place and even more excited that I read they would be open on Christmas Day! The husband and I made the 30 min drive out to the restaurant to find... they're closed! Bummer. Not sure if this was an error on Hash Kitchen's side or the New Times, but it was pretty sad. Anyway, I still wanted to try them out, so a few days later we made the trek out there again. The restaurant still looks like the old Cuttlefish restaurant, including the oyster bar, which is a bit strange. The service was good, but one of the women there, maybe the owner or manager wasn't being terribly nice to her employees within earshot of customers. Anyway, we had coffee, which was good and the waiter kept it full, so we appreciated that. For food, I tried a benedict and the husband had biscuits and gravy. The b&g was bland and nothing special. The benedict had perfectly cooked eggs, but lacked in flavor.... overall we weren't super impressed. Maybe the secret is to order one of their more complicated dishes (something with fried chicken possibly) and that would be good, but generally you also expect a restaurant to have good foundations. I probably wouldn't make the drive out there to return.

I came by Be a couple weeks ago while (sort of) doing the meet me downtown walk. I was surprised at how different Be is from Songbird in décor... they really made the space their own. I had their cold brew and it was fabulous! I really enjoyed it. The husband tried the latte and it was not so fabulous.... it was alright. Anyway, the service here was great and the food looks good, we'll have to come back to try it sometime!

This is the former BRKFST ( so you can see my review for that establishment and it is pretty much the same). After going to BRKFST with the breakfast club UYE and liking it (and then waiting a month for them to remodel and change their name), I came back to the newly branded Urbane with my mom for brunch. Luckily, the menu was mostly the same. I got to have the loco moco again (and they corrected their menu so the dish matches what is described on the menu, so that's good). Again, it was a large and tasty dish of food (and special because I can't think of anywhere else in town that serves this). The only downside was my egg was overcooked, but I sent it back and they promptly made me a new egg. My mom got the French toast, which was extra fried and delish served with a bourbon syrup. One of the people who was involved in the rebranding spent a good amount of time talking to us and telling us about their food, which was a nice touch. They have also implemented a bloody mary/mimosa bar, which looked extensive with a wide variety of fruits, veg, and other items to make your drink more interesting. Our breakfast was around 20$ so fairly standard as compared to other eateries. I would definitely return!

Oh Chanpen, I didn't think I could like you anymore than I already did until I came to your new location! I met a couple friends here and omg this location is nice! The old location was fine, especially because it held the delish food inside, but this nondescript location in a strip mall was super clean looking and nicely decorated. The food was just as good as at the original location, with their main triumph (in my opinion) being that they actually make their food spicy when you ask them to. Seems like not a big deal, but, in Phoenix, they're the only ones who do this. I got the drunken noodles and thai tea.... both delicious, both huge - I had a ton of leftovers. We all got treated to complimentary green tea ice cream at the end of the meal.... this stuff was out of this world good. I will be back!!

Flower child is one of those restaurants that just has a no fail business model.... All fresh organic type veggies... Fairly simple food... Fast casual atmosphere. It all comes together to be a winning restaurant. The only bad part of this place is the price... Most everything is fairly pricy, especially considering the restaurant is 'fast casual.' anyway, I had one of the wraps with chicken and hummus and it was damn tasty with a nice freshness to it. It also was big enough for me to take half home. Despite the price, I would come back.   Ps don't waste your time with desserts here...the couple I tried tasted way too 'healthy'... Maybe not worth the calories.

I was super excited that the people from Crudo were opening a new place and couldn't wait to try it out. The space was a little hard to find as it is in the back of a building that faces 7th (awe parked out front where there were some businesses still being built, but there is a huge lot in back). The restaurant is decorated nicely and has a 'cool' modern feel.  I went with a friend for happy hour and we went a little crazy with ordering. They have so many drinks on special, it was easy to find something that sounded delicious. I tried the okra cup and the cobbler... both were incredibly tasty and strong! I definitely felt them afterwards. We shared some food - the marinara focaccia, wings, Calabrian pork bites, and the biscuit donut. The pork bites came out first and were just ridiculously delish... little pieces of pork belly with a bit of a tang and a hint of spiciness... the portion was small, but the flavor was huge. The huge pile of wings were also wonderful.... they are smoked, which was a bit weird at first, but as we ate them we liked them more and more. The wings came with a 'white' bbq sauce.... I don't know what this was, but it was like crack.... so tasty. In fact, the white sauce and the hot sauce on the table really saved the focaccia, which was nothing special ( but tasted good when you added the sauces). The donut was tasty, but didn't taste much like biscuit... still good though. I will definitely be back, I want to try the Tennessee hot chicken... yum.   PS happy hour prices are a steal, we had 6 drinks and all of that food for about 50$

The husband and I came here for brunch on the day after thanksgiving (after many weeks of convincing on my part) and I am so glad we did! The food here was legit. It was 2 legit. You see where I'm going. Anyway, we arrived around 11, which is usually when they stop serving breakfast, but they were serving it all day for black Friday I guess.... we ordered at the counter - he got the shepherd's biscuit and I got the breakfast pita concoction. We sat down and all of the sudden the restaurant was flooded with people, good timing on our part. We had coffee while we waited, which was fairly tasty. The food came out and the plates were huge! My pita looked so fresh and delicious. Who knew that pita, hummus, feta, over medium eggs, arugula, and prosciutto made the perfect breakfast? This thing was so good, it had a freshness from the arugula and a richness from the feta and prosciutto. The pita was warm and fluffy. I haven't had a combo this tasty in a long time. The husband's was a little less exciting, but still good. It was essential a pile of meats on a biscuit (brisket, bacon, spicy sausage, and maybe something else?). I think he was hoping for a gravy of some sort. Regardless, he seemed to like it as his plate was completely clean at the end of the meal. All of this only cost about 20$. We'll be back!  PS- If this place put pancakes on the menu, it'd be an easier sell for my husband, just sayin...

Can one judge a brewery in one beer? Probably not, but the one beer I had at Pedal haus was really good.... I had the nitro maple milk stout and it was very tasty..  A nice hint of sweetness in the beer. The atmosphere was also nice, especially their patio which features a long fire pit. I would like to go back to try their food and more beers. My only complaint? They only sell beer by the pint whereas most breweries give you a few size options to allow you to taste more beers (this is a minimal complaint). I will be back!

I'm so sad to be writing this review, as I really like mad greens and their philosophies. I have been a fan of other Mad Greens locations and was excited to have one open near my house. I went in with my husband to pick up a quick order to go before he headed to work.... well, I thought it would be quick. The restaurant was empty and the girl at the counter waited for us to decide what we wanted. When we ordered, the girl asked us several times to clarify which salad we wanted... she seemed to be new, but she was left alone at the counter. I had the big Siam I Am salad (which I have had a couple of times at other locations and it has always been good) and my husband got the big Ivan salad. The girl at the counter kept going back to what must have been a list of what was in each salad as she made it, which I appreciated, except this didn't help her make the salad correctly. She used all spinach in mine, no kale as stated on the menu and forgot to put quinoa in...sort of a big component in this salad, really the only thing that makes it a meal and worth 10$. I asked if she put quinoa in and she replied 'yes.' I looked at it closer and told her there was no quinoa in it and she said she must have misheard me and went to consult someone in the back. She came back and put some quinoa in the salad. While mixing my salad, she was spilling salad out of the bowl everywhere and then using her bare hands to throw it in the trash and then continue mixing salad. I even saw her scratching her nose during food prep... I get that she may be new, but this was not terribly appetizing. She then proceeded to make my husband's salad and another girl came out, grabbed my salad and showed the initial girl that it wasn't full... maybe only 3/4ths of the way. She then proceeded to add kale (which I appreciated), but that's it to fill the container. We paid and left after about 20 minutes of waiting (a little ridiculous for a salad). When I got the salad home, I was super disappointed... this salad was ALL lettuce.... it was maybe dotted with quinoa and had a few chunks of chicken in it, definitely had significantly less of both than I have gotten in the past. When I had gotten this salad at the Tempe location, I was able to eat the regular size for two meals.... this 'big' size was barely one. It tasted fine, but wasn't filling at all. My husband's salad also was lacking in the chicken department and was missing the roasted beets completely.... I hate to knock a company that I really have liked in the past, but this experience was unacceptable. If you have new people working at your restaurant, they should be trained and supervised to avoid careless errors. I can put lettuce and dressing in a bowl at home and not spend close to 11$. After having listened to the owners of Mad Greens speak previously at an event, I think they would be embarrassed of the lack of quality coming out of this location, as they seem to be otherwise dedicated to their product. Sorry to say, but I probably won't be returning.

Let me start with a disclaimer: the people who run mad greens contacted me about my review to allow me to come back and try another salad on them. Generally, I don't accept this; however, the people who run this restaurant were adamant. I think this is a good business move because it shows that they care about their customers, and it allows people to give them another shot without the risk of having another bad experience. I feel that mad greens is a company that stands behind their product as a result of this interaction, so way to go mad greens!   I went in last weekend to get my salad, and it was very good! The man behind the counter seemed to know what he was doing and he made my salad perfectly. The salad was large and fed me for two meals, staying fresh for several days. This definitely added value to the meal. In addition to the salad, I had the hummus trio, which came with delicious warm pita bread and three different types of hummus that were each very unique. There was a spicy avocado hummus, a beet hummus, and a garlic hummus. My favorite was the spicy avocado, I like that it was just spicy enough without losing that hummus flavor. I think next time I'd get a large order of that one.  I'm glad that I gave mad greens another chance, especially since they're so close to my house. I will definitely be back!

I went to Habbouz with the International Supper Club, not exactly knowing what 'Tunisian' food would be like. I ended up enjoying it very much! This is a no frills kind of restaurant, but the employees were friendly and helpful. The food is on the expensive side (14 ish $ for a plate), but the portions are quite large. I ordered the lamb with couscous, which was huge! The lamb literally fell off the bone.. it was super tender and tasty. It came with a roasted pepper of sorts and a ton of couscous. I tasted a couple of the other dishes - the kabab (very good, especially with their special salad) and the little sausage dish with the egg on top... now that sauce was incredible!  I asked if I could have that sauce with a different meat (not a huge sausage fan), and they said it wouldn't be a problem. I know what I'm getting next time! I will definitely be back!   PS I had leftovers for 3 more meals... they were not messing around with portions here.

The new location of La Pinata is really nice... not sure why it took me so long to visit. The husband and I went to La pinata before I hopped on a plane out of town. The food was tasty and not terribly expensive (though pricier than some 'americanized' Mexican food restaurants). I had the fajita chicken burrito and he had the bean and cheese burrito. He raved about his burrito. Mine was fresh and flavorful.... maybe not rave worthy, but good. I will definitely be putting La Pinata into my Mexican food rotation.    PS they have hh here and the bar looks quite nice.

What a neat bar! Yes... I did just use the word 'neat.' The bar itself is super cool looking.... between the video games, the amazing lighting, and the huge bar, it would be worth a visit for ambiance alone. Luckily, the drinks were also on point. I tried two drinks... one that tasted like bananas (donkey kong something I think....), which was sweet and easy to drink and the other was a bit sweeter... can't remember the name of it at the moment... good story, I know. Anyway, with drinks at around 8$, you really can't go wrong. I will definitely be back!   PS The drinks listed on their website don't match their current menu 100%. My friend wanted one of the drinks she saw on the site and the bartender said they couldn't make it... wah wah.

I was very excited for Lou's to open in Phoenix. I have had their pizza once in Chicago, and it was quite the memorable experience. Due to the insanity of their opening week lines, I chose to order a pizza and spinach bread online and pick up. I ordered online early in the morning to pick up at around 7. When we arrived, the order was ready to go, and we happily passed the enormous line of people waiting for tables. The pizza was tasty... super heavy (as expected) but flavorful. We got a butter crust pie with pepperoni and garlic.... tasty business. The cheese/spinach bread was nothing terribly exciting. I would pass on that next time (especially because we couldn't even finish our small pizza and the extra order was unnecessary). If you are a deep dish fan, check out Lou Malnati's, it didn't disappoint.

Street Coffee is a welcome addition to the downtown area! I have been twice and will say that Street has some highs and some things that may still need to be worked out (but you know, they're new).   Positives- the southeast drink is pretty delicious stuff... how can you go wrong with condensed milk and cinnamon.... I ordered this on both of my trips and the first time it was a bit better than the second... not sure why.   The owners are friendly.   They roast their own beans.... that is always a plus.  Negatives - (this one is really just a negative -ish) The décor is nice, but it feels a little commercial.... it's very polished and doesn't quite fit the neighborhood, but it definitely is different from the other local coffee houses.   I tried one of their scones and it just wasn't that great... it was a little on the bland side and was tiny for the 3$ price tag. I figure the baked goods might take a little more time to get all the kinks worked out.   A friend had a plain latte and said she didn't love the flavor, but I didn't try it, so I can't really say either way.   Overall, I think Street is a nice new coffee shop that is certainly worth checking out!

As meh as the ramen is at otakumen, the pasta from pat and waldo's was actually pretty tasty. I tried the Alfredo with chicken and mushrooms... This thing was rich and super garlicky. The portion size was decent for the price (under 10$ ftw!). I would come back and have this again and would like to try their other menu items.

Let me start by saying I tried to come here the Sunday after they opened to find them closed with a note on the door saying they had run out of product. This was annoying because A) parking is a pain and costs money in this area and B) they didn't post that they would be closed online, which is the first thing I would do as a brand new business.   Regardless, I decided to come back to try the food a couple weeks later. The place was somewhat dead on a Saturday night. I tried the spicy ramen. Though it wasn't as greasy as reported by many reviewers (it was certainly edible), it was a bit greasy. It also had very little flavor. I asked for it to be extra spicy and it was hardly spicy. The meat was mediocre. The noodles were fine. I took half for leftovers, but only the noodles were edible a couple days later... The broth had become far too oily which affected the flavor. As far as ramen goes in the phx area, this was certainly near the bottom.   I also had the fried rice and that was pretty tasty. I would go back for the fried rice, but Not for the ramen.   Ps the service was fine and the Italian food in the same building was much better than the ramen.

Ehhh I dunno about this place. I went last night with a friend, excited to try a new place but hesitant because the restaurant seemed empty. When we entered, I  was pleasantly surprised. The space didn't look like America's taco shop at all... Complete transformation. We were seated and ordered fairly quickly. I had the drunken noodles and my friend had the pad see ew.  The drunken noodles were alright, though not spicy when I requested 4 star. Additionally, the whole dish was a bit overwhelmed by fish sauce... Far more than usual. My friend's dish was terrible. We both felt it tasted like petsmart smells... Like hay. It was very unpleasant. Also, both of our dishes had some random things in it... Like random small pieces of ground meat or a different kind of noodle... Like they didn't clean their pans or serving utensils very well and other dishes got mixed into ours...not a huge deal, but certainly odd. The prices were a bit high (11$/plate), especially since the food wasn't all that awesome. I would probably pass on this place in the future.

After tasting the crazy delish food at casa, I knew I had to try Shady Park. The space is nice, with a big bar and a nice patio. They weren't terribly busy on a Sunday afternoon, so my friend and I quickly received our pizza and beer. We were impressed by their menu, which featured pastas, pizzas, wings, sandwiches, and a myriad of other items. They make most items in house and have very interesting combos on their pizzas. We got the shady chicago, a red pizza with sausage, onion, peppers, ricotta, and... Walnuts. It was shockingly good. My one complaint is they only have 16 inch pizzas which are huge and kinda expensive at 20$ for a specialty pie... I wish they had more size options. I think during happy hour you can get a square of pizza and a cocktail for 3$ though, so that is fairly fabulous. Anyway, go check it out... It was good!  Ps their rules on their menu stated that yelpers weren't welcome, but hopefully they will make an exception for this one.

The Brickyard sticks out in Chandler like a sore thumb..... this place is super 'hip' with amazing drinks... it has the feeling of a downtown Phoenix bar. I wish they were in downtown because as is my imbibing at this bar is limited, but my loss is Chandler's gain. I met a friend here for happy hour and it was a very good hh. They have discounted apps and 'classic' specialty cocktails. I had their Pimm's and it was one of the best renditions of a Pimm's cup I've had in a long time! We also tried a couple of their 'custom' drinks, which were a little less successful. My friend had a tasty sounding drink that sounded sweet (it had coffee and cocoa and a marshmallow), but was super boozy and was difficult to drink. I tried the sonoran sour, which was alright, but I much preferred the Pimm's. We also tried their pork belly app, which was tasty, but too small for the price.  Regardless, I think this is a high quality bar and a must visit if you're in the downtown Chandler area!

Yet another awesome coffee shop in downtown Phoenix! I came here with a friend on a Sunday and this place was empty... I can kind of see why. The coffee shop itself is cold... sleek and modern...hipster -y for sure... but not inviting. The space doesn't really invite people to sit and relax. The chairs are sparse and not particularly comfortable. The one amazing upside of the space.... parking! They have a few parking spaces behind the building. Anyway, the point is, this place is more like a walk up coffee bar vs a coffee shop to hang out in. I love that this shop uses Danzeisen milk (delish and local)... was a little disappointed that their coffee isn't locally roasted, BUT my latte was amazing, so I really can't complain. This latte was creamy, rich, and not acidic in the least. Check this coffee shop out for a legit latte... but don't plan on hanging out.

What an amazing idea for a studio! This studio makes me feel like a kid again. The space is fairly large and has a thick squishy floor that is not only good for safety, but also good for helping (me anyway) get deeper into poses. For example... I can do full splits on this floor, but am about an inch from the ground on hard floor... it's pretty cool. Anyway, the classes are fairly diverse and are all 'play' based.... I wouldn't exactly categorize it as 'yoga,' but it is completely enjoyable. I loved the intro to acro class, the flexibility class with Arynn (it was so hard I was soooore), and the tumbling class (this was a crazy workout, but felt like pure fun!.. think somersaults, cartwheels, and splits...awesome!). The handstand class was also a lot of fun and helpful to someone trying to learn to handstand. So go check it out... support some awesome local people.... You don't get much better than AcroBody!   PS at this time I believe drop ins are 13$ and a 10 class pass or month unlimited is 99$... not a bad deal.

I have been patiently waiting for this coffee place to open, and now it has.... Huzzah. This coffee shop is large, in a good location, and has a trendy vibe. The owner and his dad were extremely nice, welcoming, and helpful. I had a conversation with each of them, and they seemed to be invested in quality ingredients and their customer base. If you haven't heard their story, the owner of this coffee shop suffered from a traumatic brain injury and went through extensive rehab. This shop is an incredible accomplishment and an inspiration to others who may have to overcome adversity. Go Oliver!  Now on to the coffee....they use locally roasted beans (bergies) and local (expensive) milk (danzeisen), so of course my latte tasted good! You can't go wrong with high quality local ingredients. Additionally, the latte was fairly priced at 3.80 after tax. I was a bit sad that they don't have chai yet, but Oliver said he would work on getting it soon. I would highly recommend you get your behind down here and check out this coffee shop!  Ps - I know there are many good coffee shops in the neighborhood, I wouldn't say this one is better than the rest, but a definite contender...I think I need to start a rotation

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! I've been to this location of the herb box twice now, once for drinks/snacks and once for brunch. The brunch here is on the pricier side, but the food is tasty and the portions are large. I had the chilaquiles, which were rich and flavorful. The chips in the bowl stayed crispy as I ate the egg and pork. It was a solid breakfast option, though a little pricey at 13$.  The drinks here are incredible! I had their fig based drink, and it was one of the most delicious cocktails I have had in a long time. It was sweet without being too sweet. My friend got the 'woo woo' cocktail, which was also tasty. The drinks were fairly priced at 11$. I do wish they had a hh. While getting cocktails, we decided to try a side of their mac and cheese..... oh em gee. This may be the best mac and cheese in town. It was on the small side, but super rich. It was perfectly creamy with an amazing crunchy topping.... ridiculously delicious. Not badly priced at 8$. I will definitely be back!

I went to Southern Rail last Friday with a friend and her mom with a miraculous reservation (called at around 4 and got a res for 5:45 despite no availability online... yesss!). We tried many of the salads and small plates and they were all good (I guess they worked their kinks out) Here is what we had:   onion and tomato tart - very good, the onions were nicely caramelized, so their flavor was not overly strong... yum!  Cornbread salad- every element on this dish was delicious, the okra was perfect, the sauce was good, the beets were even good (and I do no like beets)  The brioche rolls - these things could be addicting, they are served with some wonderful apple butter and when eaten together, they are a good balance of sweet and salty.   Dirty rice croquettes- these were my overall favorite... they were bursting with flavor and extremely filling. They were spicy with a nice fresh element from the greens served with it and the pea shoots. Overall, a real winner.   Watermelon salad - very light and fresh, yummy  Gumbo- nice flavor, a little less spicy than I would typically like, but overall a solid dish. The small plate is a small cup, but it's hearty.   The broccoli and cauliflower casserole - this was ok, but parts of it were ice cold.... not great.   These small plates were more than enough for the 3 of us, we were stuffed and didn't even finish all of the food.   We also had a couple of cocktails. The Austin mule was delicious... perfectly gingery and citrusy. My friend had another cocktail that sounded good... the name escapes me, but it was way too boozy tasting. Overall, this place was very good, and I am already planning a return visit!

I stopped into this new coffee shop today after reading about it on AZ Central. I was excited to see what they did with the old Amsterdam bar.. When I arrived, I found it a little difficult to park because it's located on a one way street ...so for everyone trying to park, make sure that you go South one street to pierce and then turn into the small road to the left side of the light rail so that you can turn into their parking lot. The place has very cute decor, with clocks showing the time  in different parts of the world(you know, grand central themed). They have a loft area upstairs and ample seating downstairs (the perfect place to hang out and study or chat with friends). The staff were all friendly and helpful. They source their coffee from infusion coffee and tea in Tempe and get their chai from David Rio. Essentially the drinks here are like the drinks at infusion Coffee and Tea (aka delish), but far closer to my house (even better). They also have a full bar and many beer taps (a variety of local and nonlocal craft brews at a decent price point). Their happy hour right now is from 11 to 7...most excellent. I know I will be making many return trips to Grand Central and recommend you do the same!
