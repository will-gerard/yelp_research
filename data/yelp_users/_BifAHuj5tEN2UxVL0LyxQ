We all have Cox because it is the only cable provider in the valley and I'm tired of it. CenturyLink only offers abysmal internet speeds, the highest of which is still slower than the slowest Cox can offer. While this may seem like a win for Cox, it is still a loss for the consumer. Cox's monopoly over the valley's internet means that they can charge whatever the hell they feel like charging you and also tack hidden fees on your next bill.  When I lived in Los Angeles, I had Time Warner, in which I was paying less for faster speeds, with UNLIMITED bandwidth up or down, and it was reliable to say the least. Excellent customer service and product.  Google is charging only $70 for 1GB of bandwidth, granted it is only in select cities, and a very expensive on their part. Hopefully they roll out Google fiber optic into Phoenix, because it really needs new competition out here. If you don't know much about internet speeds, you are paying $70 for Cox PREMIER @ up to 50MB vs Google Fiber Optic same price, for 1000MB. I don't even think the average person needs over 50 or 150MB/s speeds, but we don't want to be giving up our first born child just so my computer can watch a 2 minute video at 1080p.  The sad part is, no matter how many reviews go on this, they are still the only place we can go, and it won't make a difference anyway.

My sister took me here because she used to take her kids to the dance studio next door (dance on, my friends). To my surprise, I actually found a breakfast place that doesn't completely kill me on the inside. I'm used to finding good breakfast spots in Los Angeles, but here in Arizona it's a bit tricky and usually you give in to the drab that is named IHOP, then regret it later. I understand the location is a bit far away from what most normal people would travel to get food, but if you are in the area, DEFINITELY check it out.  The menu is pretty standard, the eggs benedict is actually good and I don't usually eat that. I had a caprece omelet, but added steak! I think the manager (or someone important?) came out and told me it was a pretty good idea; and it was. Outdoor seating is a little limited, but it's there. The inside has more seating, but it's honestly not too bright in there (which is actually good for early hangover breakfast outings).  Overall 5 stars because of the food. Service was good, but nothing you will be blown away by, still good though, keep it up guys!

I don't usually order pizza as much as I used to, but this Pizza Hut was right across the street from my house and they are actually much friendlier and quicker than most other Pizza Hut places I've ordered from.  Granted, this is a chain so you're going to get chain pizza.  Will it break the mold and make your mouth water? Probably not, but it's convenient, it's fair priced (always take advantage of coupons), and fast.

(Double post from the other CRAS here on yelp)  Hi all, former student here (7-27-11pt if that means anything to you). Just popping in to do a quick review and tell a small snippet of my time here.   I spent 10 cycles here when it was 10 cycles I'd say only a couple months after they had Pro Tools tier 6 certification rolling out. The school is basically what you make out of it. I originally came here to learn how to use DAWs, learn about sound, how to make sounds on DAWs and make them sound great, and also produce music. While you will not get a musical education here, you will get a full load of technical information your brain and ears will thank you for later! So it wasn't exactly what I was looking for initially, but I was optimistic.  If you thought you were going to get a crash course in engineering, music theory, production, and everything in between, you may need to look elsewhere. With that being said, if you want to be a recording engineer, move out to Nashville, Los Angeles, New York, anywhere you can find work, or freelancing, there's no better place to learn than here. You go through 3 weeks of each cycle where they drop knowledge on you from day 1 for 4 hours. Be prepared to work your butt off! No matter how much time I spent here, I wish I had spent more, and in reality, you will too. When you leave the school and go on your internship you'll be really sad, but you will also start a new life! I believe it's even 12 cycles now, so you get a little more time spent there than I did! Again, I never thought about being an engineer, I only wished I could use DAWs like professionals and produce my own music. During my time at CRAS I actually got pretty decent at engineering, so I thought I'd just be hindering myself if I didn't give it my absolute 100% all in.  The staff is pretty good. Project staff are basically guys who you will learn to love, fear or both. They will give you shit if you can't wrap cables, and they will be hard on you about studio time limits, cleanliness, and overall studio etiquette...BUT ITS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. Make mistakes now, and fix yourself now, because when Muse is in the live room waiting to record, your ass doesn't have time to be making $10,000 mistakes because you couldn't plug microphones in the wall. They will help you out, if you want the help, and you are motivated. They will help you reach your goals! The teachers know what they are talking about as well...I'm not if they are still there, but Phil and Sean the Pro Tools guys, will blow your mind with their knowledge. You can literally ask Phil anything and he will know, seriously, ask him. You got Alan who is LA engineering wizard, GHERY is the god of SSLs in Arizona. There are literally too many to name (What's up Paul)!!  Thanks to CRAS I did an internship at Eldorado Recording Studios in Burbank, I worked 80-100 hours my first 3 weeks at the studio then landed a job within those three weeks. They taught me everything from basic signal flow to being able to run a large format console by myself. They also teach you tape...which honestly, is NOT DEAD. I used tape almost every day of my life at the studio. You NEED to be able to clean tape heads, sling tape on the machine, run the machine, link it to pro tools, get it to run from the desk, calibrate, EVERYTHING. Mentors at the studio will help you out and refresh your memory on the job, but you need a good base for this knowledge. Luckily, fresh out of school, you will have your notes as well.  After school I managed to get on a few really amazing records, meet a lot of cool and crazy artist, and got paid to do something fun and you can be proud of. You may also make tons of like-minded individuals at school and on your way. I know you always hear people's success stories and think, wow can I believe that, or man can I do that? You certainly can, but it's all up to how you work.  Okay this is actually a lot longer than I anticipated, but I just noticed there weren't that many reviews on this place and I wanted to give it a fair review to give future students a better idea on what they are getting out of it. Like ANYTHING IN LIFE, you certainly get what you put in. I put in quite a bit, and I got quite a bit.  Here's proof if you want:  http://www.discogs.com/artist/2928377-Eric-Isip?limit=50 http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eric-isip-mn0002999554/credits

As far as coffee goes in Arizona, your choices are pretty slim.  You have your Starbucks, your Dutch Bros, Coffee Beans, Coffee Rushes, and all the little indie ones in between...  If you like your coffee fast, with some personality, and at this special location, 24 hours...then Dutch Brothers in the KING of the coffee chains in Arizona. Without any modifications I'd say they are probably the sweetest version of their counterparts, but I usually make everything a little less sweet anyway.  Their pricing is competitive with Starbucks and other coffee shops while still feeling like you got a decent deal (or maybe we are all used to overpaying for coffee now a days?). Irregardless, I drive for Uber on the weekends quite a bit when I don't have any major plans and they are the only place I can score a great cup of coffee past 10 PM.  The brand itself has a reputation for the baristas having great personalities and having tons of fun while working. This location is no different, in fact, they are all pretty awesome, especially the super late weekend crew.  Dutch on, my friends.

They repaired my iPad that was previously repaired by a company Rapid iPhone Fix (he fixed a cracked screen). Soon after the iPad had problems with the touch screen typing and he wouldn't come fix it again (customer service level over 9000 obviously).  These guys came in and used way more sturdier glass and also got me some deals fixing my other old iPhones and further reinforcing my roommates current iPhone.  Just by talking to them you can tell they use the best materials and actually know what they are talking about.   Would recommend them to my friends in the future! And will call again if anything else breaks (crosses fingers)!
