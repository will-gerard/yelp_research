Hands-down the best sushi in town. And I've tried 1 million sushi places. I love the owners, I love the rolls. The sashimi is so fresh it melts in your mouth. The tuna tataki is amazing. I get the Sunkist roll every time. I'm so glad I'm moving back to Gilbert so I'm closer to Temari!

Eggs were dry, potatoes were swimming in oil, the bacon had been sitting out for hours because that came out right away before there rest of the meal got there. The English muffin was cold when it was delivered. I had a stomachache all day after eating here. I will never eat here again. I cannot for the life of me figure out why it's packed all the time.

This company is by far the best bartending service I have ever used. The girl that runs it called me back immediately, she got all the info for my boyfriend's party and even asked what kind of bartender I wanted. She even came up with some awesome ideas for drinks to serve, printed out a menu, framed it, and put it on the bar for my guests. I got tons of compliments about the bar and I don't write many reviews but they were spectacular! My party was a huge success!!
