I've never been treated more rudely. Incredibly disrespectful Pharmacist with a horrid attitude. Not only was he awful to me, I also watched as he ripped the poor women in front of me that was obviously in pain. Sadly he gives this store a bad reputation.

I have never been treated so horribly! Not only was the customer service terrible, the owner also made snide and rude comments in reference to me. UPS take note...this guy has no business displaying your good name. I will never set foot in this place again and you shouldn't either unless you are looking to have a really bad day.

Stumbled upon this great restaurant by accident. It's hidden at the back of a strip center and very hard to see. Fabulous service with amazing lunch specials. Everything we ordered was delicious! We will be back.

Being an active Realtor I am introduced to and work with a number of Home Inspectors. Some good, some not so good. I was incredibly happy with George from Affordable Inspections. Not only was he thorough and professional, he was patient and took the time to answers all of my clients questions and concerns. I was equally impressed with his knowledge. I will be using him again! Thank you George.
