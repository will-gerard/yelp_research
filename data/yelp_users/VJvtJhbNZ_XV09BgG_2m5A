Everybody treated us really good tonight the hostess got us a table pretty quick the waiter Was excellent. The penne rustica has the chicken and shrimp and had a little spice. The pasta Milano was the bowtie pasta with chicken and mushrooms. My 11-year-old daughter had to have the pork chop and I tasted it and it was delicious and the risotto was creamy and the mushrooms were awesome. My only complaint is it's too far from my home in Gilbert.

Well tonight I gave sonic another chance and it took over 10 minutes  to get our order and out of that line. To find out that they messed up the order and I don't get an apology instead I get irritated teenage girl. Not sure I'll be visiting anytime soon. The great thing is I'll be a lot healthier if I stay away from this fast food joint. And a lot happier without the attitude.

I can't believe how easy it was to get a table if six on a Saturday night! Our waitress was polite, helpful and met our every need. Not to be negative but I didn't expect this in Arizona. After living here six years, I was surprised to have a delicious Italian meal in the Wild West. Bravo to the owners! I had some spicy shrimp fettuccine and it was pretty good. My daughter had the salmon which was a bit overcooked but as a nine year old she didn't notice. My other two had lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs and everybody was happy.

I'm a big Fan of Jimmy John's. However I ordered three sandwiches with two kids and they wanted to split both. The only different ingredient they wanted on half of one of the sandwiches was a smear of mayonnaise on half and dry on the other. And easy enough request however I was told it is "corporate policy" And they couldn't Fulfill this simple request. Not sure why they could not cater to me and my twins. But I agreed to have the sandwich dry and take mayonnaise packets with us. So I asked for a plastic knife so they could spread the mayonnaise on the one side and then I was told they don't even have any Utensils. I'm kind of annoyed they didn't tell me about the utensil situation until after we had the sandwiches paid for wrapped up and going out the door.  Combine this with the Crazy story about not being able to get alfalfa sprouts back in the restaurant. I really do wonder what their training videos are all about.

I wish I could rate it higher because the girl was very nice to help me however the selection was lacking today and the wait was super long. There were zero brownie bites available and only one box of carrot bites. And two ready made boxes of cookies and only one plain bagel...I'm on the run most days and need quick fresh treats available and typically can get my needs met here.

This is our first season with Arsenal and it may be our last. Our coach fosters a negative environment.

So happy they opened up here! Great taste& quick...my hungry soccer girls love this place. Only problem is the crew is rowdier than every other jimmy johns I ever patronized before so that's why I am not giving it 5 stars.

I love this place! The customer service is out of this world. And every cake is moist and incredibly topped.
