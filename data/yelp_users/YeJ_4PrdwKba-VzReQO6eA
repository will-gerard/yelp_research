Yummy wings and pizza for a good price. Our waiter was super nice and friendly. Good spot to watch sports and have pizza!

Best place for beer, pizza, and wings! Love the atmosphere and the food is delish. Besides pizza and wings everything else I've tried before has always been very good. Oh and the homemade beer is the best part :)

This place is not worth the money or craving of sushi. If you ask for eel sauce they will give you teriyaki sauce!! I asked our waiter why she gave me teriyaki sauce and she said that's what the chefs do and people don't usually notice. What sushi place can't give you a real side of eel sauce?! So over this place. They used to be good but it seems like they'd rather save money than customers.

Came here for the first time today and was a little nervous because the place is so small, but it turned out to be some of the best sushi I've ever had! Shrimp Vegas roll was amazing and our server was very sweet. Highly recommend this place!

Went here for the first time today and was very impressed. I got the grilled chicken salad and it was delish. The guy helping me decide what to get was very nice. Definitely a good spot for some baja style Mexican food!

I'm giving this place a one star because it was the worst service I have ever had and we had a table. Our bottle service was sooo crappy and the girl was hardly ever there to check in to see if we needed a drink made or just wanted anything else. I went outside with friends because they had to smoke a cigarette and when we wanted to get back in they told us we had to get to the end of the longggg line when we had a table!! Ridiculous! If we are paying thousands of dollars for this table and bottle service I expect to get treated a little better than that. The door guys were so rude.   The place is so small, hot, and crowded. They really just need to shut this place down and put something better and bigger and have an outside area so that people can get out and get some air.
