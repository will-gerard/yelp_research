I would like to give this place a zero if it would let me. My best friend had her wedding here the first Friday of November and I would like to preface that the ceremony was beautiful and I am so happy for my friend that this place did not completely ruin the best day of her life. PLEASE DO NOT HAVE YOUR EVENT HERE! IT IS THE MOST DISORGANIZED VENUE I HAVE EVER BEEN AT OR INVOLVED WITH! Let's begin on Thursday, they had told the bride that we could come in whenever on Thursday to set up our own decor, that all of the tables and silverware would be set up, then we could go and have the rehearsal that evening. We got there at 5 pm. The bride immediately told the gentlemen that were setting up tables that the room itself was supposed to be bigger. It was one of those rooms with the collapsible walls, and only one half of the room was open. He basically told her that he just works there and that he would go get the person in charge. While we were waiting for the "person in charge" we also noticed that there were supposed to be 8 tables of 8 and there were only 5 tables of 8, also the wedding party's head table was supposed to be 14 and there were 20 chairs. Then we noticed that there was no cake table, gift table, or sign in table set up. Then the bride started asking the "person in charge" why everything was incorrectly set up and why is it just now getting done when she was told it should have been ready in the MORNING of that day, this "person in charge" basically started the blame game. That everyone else is new there except her and the notes she was given were wrong and blah blah excuse after excuse. There was not a SINGLE apology or comment that they were going to FIX any of the issues. A little later the "person in charge" came up to the bride and told her that they will make it perfect for her and that for the inconvenience they would throw in white chair covers and black bows for free. The bride was happy with that and we decided to go and do the rehearsal and come back for the rest of the table decorations once the tables were set up. That is about when Nora got there. Now, I had heard from the bride that there had been multiple people that she had worked with at the venue since they booked the wedding there so I was trying to give the benefit of the doubt to this Nora. She was very nice and said that she would walk us to where the ceremony area was and that if anyone needed a ride she would have a golf cart bring them. While we were walking to the ceremony area, we passed the area that the cocktail hour was to be and we noticed that there were two beautiful fountains and a series of lights, the bride confirmed that the day of the wedding those would all be turned on and Nora said yes. Then we went back into the rehearsal hall. The only real thing that they got done was open the room, expand the dance floor and add the tables. We had to remove the extra chairs from the head table and also had to continuously tell the "person in charge" that half of the mirror chargers on the center of the tables were chipped and we kept noticing that they were just putting those on DIFFERENT tables when we asked for not chipped ones. Since none of the "free chair covers or bows" were set up yet, we decided that we would just go ahead and go to our rehearsal dinner activity, that we were already behind schedule for, and finish decorating in the morning. When we left the bride confirmed that the bridal suite that we were getting ready in would be ready at 6 AM and Nora confirmed that and that the groomsman all had golf booked for the morning at 7ish. ALL confirmed by Nora. Fast forward to the next day, the day of the wedding. One of the bridesmaids arrived before us and went to check into the room. They asked her what room number she is in and could not check her in. They basically told her that there was not a room ready. That was when she called the bride, the bride then called Nora and it went to voicemail. She tried a couple more times all going to voicemail. Our first bridesmaid did end up getting a room and once we got there it was fine. Then we checked on the reception hall. Well, all of the tables were set up and the room looked overall fine. However, the "free chair covers and bows" looked AWFUL they were SUPER wrinkled and only maybe 6 chairs had the bows. Also, we brought our own candles for the centerpieces but they were supposed to provide oil candles for the head table and the sign in table. Those were no where to be found. Then back at the bridal suite, we were all starting to get ready and the bride gets a phone call from the groom saying that the golf was not booked. That they could not get on the green until 10 AM. Now the wedding started at 3:45 PM. That was when the bride called Nora again and it again went to voicemail.The Groom had to put his foot down and basically figure out the golf situation by himself due to the lack of response from Nora. I have to cut this off but DO NOT USE THIS PLACE!!

This little business is a POWERHOUSE for mailing needs, and you can snag a cute card or a yummy candle! I love this place. The girls are knowledgeable and are always there to answer all of my questions! They save me money everytime I go in there. We have a box there for our business and they are so sweet everytime I call and ask if the mail is in, I know I drive them crazy when I call and ask about my packages, but they are NEVER rude or annoyed with me. I love them all and I am thrilled that they are there and I APPRECIATE them more than they know! :-)

I hired AZ Tree Trimmer to do a clean up on a vacant property and also to remove two large stumps. They were friendly, approachable and most importantly reasonably priced. They did the work timely and efficiently. Grant and his team do good quality work and I am more than happy to support local businesses like his again!
