Delicioso! Oh and the Margaritas are delicious...I should know, it's my middle name!  But really, the food here is quite authentic.  The chips and salsa are very sabrosos!  The serving size is substantial and enough to take home leftovers.  I prefer their green chile (again, I'm from New Mexico and very picky about my Mexican food!). I had a combination plate with enchiladas and tacos (if a place can't pull these two simple dishes off...this chica from NM is gonna go elsewhere) and they were both delicious.  Everyone at my table really enjoyed their food.    I can't wait to go back and try the albondigas soup which I've heard so much about.  I hear they also have a pretty good happy hour.   Buen provecho!

I had never even heard of this place...especially since I'm a West Sider! However, some friends were in town for the night and found it on Yelp.  Glad they did.  Made the trek and ended up having some really tasty pizza.  Perfect sauce/cheese ratio and the crust was PERFECT! Can't wait to go back and try it again!

I was going back and forth between 1 and 2 stars.  Mostly because of the service.    We called and had a reservation for 8.  Which was fine.  We were seated promptly and our server was VERY friendly.  However, that is where the decision between the 1 and 2 stars kicked in.  3 of our party were already sitting down with their waters when we arrived.  A few minutes later she came and took our drink orders.  I asked for a SAMPLE of a beer and my friend ordered a flight...and some waters.  She came and gave everyone else their drinks/sodas and we got nothing.  No beer.  No water.  Oh and an extra margarita that was wrong.  They fixed that and brought it back but still no beers or waters.  So I kindly asked our server (J) for our waters and they were just sitting on a tray behind us the entire time.  Mind you, the place was not that busy.  We asked for our beers...my tiny little sampler and the flight and she said "OOOPS! I messed up...I'll grab them."  A few minutes later and still NOTHING.  So we asked again, "OH they didn't bring them out to you?"...40 minutes later and I finally got my SAMPLE of beer and my friend got her flight.  We then got our food.  Which was fine until we realized one of our party did not receive the main part of her dish.  She clearly ordered the brewers club with a side of onion rings, which the server quickly told her that it was a .95 cent upcharge, to which my friend was fine with.  So when we informed our server that  they didn't bring her sandwich and only a side of onion rings, she said, "Well, I have to check the ticket for that." Ummm...you clearly understood that she ordered the sandwich and the onion rings because you mentioned the upcharge.  5 minutes later she gets a sandwich that was clearly thrown together at the last possible moment!    We did ask to speak to a manager.  Our server brought him over and we very kindly, no really, we were super nice about it, told them of our issues. *took forever to get water *she wrote the wrong margarita orders down *we had to ask for our beer 3 times and it took 40 minutes for me to get a SAMPLER.  (Manager said, "it took that long for you to get a sample?" YES! *we didn't get the main portion of one of the orders because our server "Messed up"   He just nodded and said okay.  He didn't offer to comp anything.    In the end, even after telling her who was on what ticket, she still made some mistakes on the check, but at that point we didn't even bother telling her and just figured it out on our own.    Kindness only gets you so far.  Incompetence...yeah, that is what gets you 1 star.  It may not seem like much, but when you are sitting there waiting for almost an hour to get 2 oz of a drink...it is ridiculous!

For being pretty much the only shopping mall in the area, this one isn't too shabby!  Has all the stores I need:  Sephora Apple Store Teavana NY and Co Torrid Bath and Body Works Build A Bear Disney  Decent Food Court: Paradise Bakery Chipotle My Big Fat Greek ORANGE JULIUS Great Steak typical chinese places  It's pretty much always busy and parking is a biotch at times, but nowadays where is parking ever easy?

I know I said I hate "chain" restaurants...but honestly I really do.    We were looking for a reverse happy hour and this was close by so we gave in.  The beer was cold, but our food took FOREVER...literally!  Then, they cooked my steak incorrectly...instead medium rare it came out super over done...I asked for a baked potato and got mashed.  I can say that the bartender (we sat at the bar), noticed immediately and sent it back and had it taken off of our bill.  So the two stars is for the food and for the slow service of the kitchen...I'd give more for the attentiveness of the bartender and the manager!

I can't even imagine going to that "green and gold" place again!  Super friendly and absolutely delicious sandwiches!    I ordered a typical turkey sub with provolone and it was made to perfection.  The fact that they slice the deli meat to order was the kicker for me.  The bread is perfection...soft and has great flavor.    Do yourself a favor, have some good sense and head to Mr. Goodcents!

Great little dive bar in a fun and convenient location to any downtown events!  The food was pretty tasty, even if we only tried the happy hour fare...wings are similar to the ones at the "owl" establishment.  Very bready...maybe too bready, but the sauce is super tasty!  Great selection of beers, too.  It's a pretty cozy and fun place.

Great music and fun atmosphere!   Parking is definitely an adventure, be prepared for a little trek from your car to the bar! Totally worth it.  In my opinion, the fact that the place is a dive bar, makes it even better! Small and PACKED! Everyone is very friendly and all are there to just have a good time and listen to some great live music!

What a fun place! It's as if you are traveling back in time to a real old fashioned ice cream parlor!  Even the servers have these ol' fashioned uniforms!    There are so many flavors...too many to choose from!  I chose to have a flight of ice cream and tried 5 different flavors.  My favorite was the peanut butter with giant chunks of peanut butter!  MMMM  Pistachio was to die for!    I can't wait to go back and try a few other flavors!  Friendly, fun environment!

Happy Hour.  That's the only reason I will go to Macayo's.  The food is sub par.  I have no idea how it can be called authentic.   I do have friends who love this place and of course, to each their own.  I just can't.    Service is dependent upon the mood of your server.  You will either get prompt service with a smile, or the slowest service with a side of attitude!  If you're lucky you'll get the ever popular "eye roll".

Now I know this is not the "best" steak in the land, but it never fails.  A nice steak cooked to medium rare..yup, I like mine bloody, a fluffy baked potato with just a touch of butter and sour cream, and some of the yummiest caesar salad I can think off.  Very friendly service and atmosphere!

This place is like my Cheers! I go at least 3 times a week on my way to work for my iced tea and the staff always greets me by name! The fact that they have crushed ice is just icing on the cake.  Plus...where else can you find so many different fountain drinks in one place?  Always clean and well stocked!  I feel like I'm cheating on my QT if I go to a different one!

Being from New Mexico and missing the food something fierce...made me want to not like this place.    I have to tell you, it is not like the food back home.  No matter how hard anyone tries...New Mexico is hard to replicate.    Thanks to Yelp, we got some free chips and salsa.  The red salsa is very chunky and can be difficult to scoop out of the little bowl with the chips...tasty and could use a bit more jalapeño in my opinion....sorry I love hot chile!  There is also a green/tomatillo salsa that is also very yummy!    I couldn't decide what to try..a green chile cheeseburger or one of their brunch offerings.  As I perused the menu, I noticed that it does have more of the northern New Mexico feel to it rather than the souther NM food I am used to. I opted for the brunch offering.   I can tell you it is very rare to find dishes served with black beans in southern NM, but theirs were tasty...a bit on the salty side.  They were served on the side of the Carlsbad Benedict...a very spicy and unique take on some Eggs Benedict. I opted for them to be served with carne adobada.  Very different from how it is back home, but very tender and spicy nonetheless.  Here, they prepare it as shredded beef marinated and saucy, where I am used to it being more of a steak that is in a drier rub type of seasoning.  Again, I really did enjoy this take on carne adobada.   The eggs were poached perfectly and I absolutely LOVED the jalapeño hollandaise sauce that finished off this dish.    I wasn't thrilled with the fried potatoes that were served on the side.  They looked and tasted as if they had been sitting there for a while.  Not fresh at all.    The kicker...in a good way...was the build your own Bloody Mary bar.  For $3.75, I was given a very generous serving of vodka and made my way over to the little table.  There was a wide range of offerings or "accoutrements" for your custom bloody mary!  From pickled asparagus, seasoned and marinated jicama (MY FAVORITE), olives, pepperonccinis, pickles, a ton of hot sauces, tomato juice, clamato, V8, and even fresh horseradish!  I'm sure there was more, but I couldn't fit anything else into my glass!  I must say, I make a mean bloody mary!  For the price, you can't go wrong!  I look forward to going back and trying their large menu!  It is a cool place and I'm sure it gets packed during football season for the early opening for the early games...early! ;-)

This does the job when I need a fix of New Mexico red chile sauce!  The #14 combo and add a relleno!  That's all I'm going to say...make sure you get an egg on top so it's authentic! ;-)

Loved this place!   I ordered the fish and chips and they live up to the "raves" on Yelp!  The batter was not at all over powering and gave just the right bit of crunch.  Loved the hand cut fries as well...doused in some yummy malt vinegar and a big helping of some hard cider...I was happy!

I brought my sister and her friend who were in town for pedicures and eyebrow waxes. Also for my niece and her friend to get their nails for the Justin bieber concert. Well, I feel horrible for taking them here.    Lynn has been doing my eyebrows for a while now. Even when she was at a different location. She HURT my sister and her friend. Almost 24 hours later and they are still in pain. She was extremely rude and very unprofessional. She had just finished eating and was smacking whatever food was left in her mouth the entire time. You could also hear her food digesting inner stomach which made the experience even more uncomfortable.   Now to the little girls.   Unfortunately we don't all speak the same language, but that is no excuse to be blatantly rude and making fun of two little girls who are excited about a concert. The women painting their nails were CLEARLY making fun of them and the girls felt soooooo uncomfortable.    I will NEVER be back nor will I refer anyone.   There are plenty of nail salons and this one has lost my business and that of everyone I know.

Being from New Mexico and only about 20 minutes away from Hatch, I find that I am very picky about my Mexican food!    I'm not saying that this is the end all be all of Mexican cuisine in the valley, but for some reason...it just helps me not miss home so much.   I am usually very critical of a restaurants red chile.  I could tell before tasting it that their red chile sauce is made from a powder, which I am typically not a fan of.   However, R & T's red chile sauce has a very delicious taste! Their rice is perfect and not at all sticky and pasty like you find in many restaurants.  Their beans are very good and you always get a decent amount on your plate.    I usually get the combo with 2 red enchiladas and 1 beef taco.  The tacos are delicious and you can tell that the corn tortilla is freshly fried to order.    On one occasion, I did try the green chile and I will not be trying it again.  It is nothing like home or like anything that I've ever had.  I'll stick to the red sauce!  What makes this a 4-star review for me is the staff.  We always sit in the back bar area and are always served by one of two women who are so friendly and helpful and remind of the places back home!    Buen Provecho!   P.S.  I have never ordered this, but friends have...on Wednesdays (at the original location), they have all-you-can-eat tacos and enchiladas for $9.99!!!

Always delicious and always there when I need it.   Here is another place that I am a creature of habit! Side by side salad no pico and extra salsa!  Fresh and tasty.    The side by side salad isn't on the menu, but they are always ready to make the exception and create my favorite meal.  Lettuce, mexican cheese, sliced avocado, grilled chicken drizzled with their green tomatillo salsa.  Of course I make a visit to their salsa bar and add some hot red salsa, lots of cilantro and a few squeezes of fresh lime!    Ahhhhhh Baja Fresh...I Love you!

Loved it!  That sauce is pretty awesome.    Crispy coating on my shrimp stayed crispy and crunchy.    I was a bit disappointed that they were out of oysters...but there's always next time.  I'm a bit embarrassed to say that even having lived in the valley for over 10 years, this was my first trip to Pete's.  I don't know why I waited so long!

Ok, so we have driven past this place a hundred times always wondering what it was.  Finally figured out it was BBQ and after some random shopping adventures, the bff and I were ready for some BBQ.    We walked in and the place was pretty full!  The decor is...interesting...very "grandma's living room" but makes you feel at home.  I couldn't decide between the brisket sandwich or the pulled pork so I asked our server.  He immediately said the brisket was his top choice.  So I went for it.    I do not regret it.  I asked for 2 different sauces on the side.  Yes! Finally a place that just gives you the brisket sliced thinly and sauce on the side! Just like my dad does it!   Their cajun BBQ sauce is perfection! Not too spicy, but more than flavorful!  The brisket is very tender and flavorful...also VERY LEAN! The bun is soft and not at all too bready...sorry, but a bready bun just ruins the sandwich! I'm there for the meat, not for the bread ;-)  I really enjoyed dinner and will definitely be going back!  If you can, ask to sit by the window facing their little "garden"!  You might have a few of 3 of the cutest bunnies you've ever seen...might I add that they are HUGE bunnies!  So cute just hopping around! Was definitely a bonus! hehehe

Wow.  Just wow!   This would be a 5 star review, but our service knocked it down a star  We waited about 45 minutes, but enjoyed the ambiance and the art work on the wall.  When we were seated, I already knew we were going to order the tableside guacamole (one of the items I found to be a bit over priced)  $12 for a pretty small bowl of guacamole.  Yes, it was fantabulous, so in the end I didn't mind paying...but it was a pretty small bowl to be shared between 3 people.  It was made very quickly (with little/no interaction from our server...when I noticed the other server in the area was laughing and explaining the process to his tables....however, our server was not the most personable of fellows...) and with very fresh ingredients, cilantro, jalapeno, pomegranate seeds...opted for no onions, and topped with fresh lime juice and seasonings.  It was delicious.  I also have to add that the tostadas that they use are fantastic.  Crispy, thick, not greasy or salty at all!  We ordered a couple of drinks, I chose my go-to drink: Michelada with Tecate.  I went picosito and it was delicious.  The right amount of hot sauce, lime juice and beer!  A friend of mine ordered the spicy margarita (which our server forgot and had to be reminded) and she loved it!    As for our meals, 2 of us chose the Mariscos enchiladas.  A white cream sauce with oaxaca cheese, bay scallops, shrimp...HUGE shrimp cooked to perfections, and crab meat.  A few hunks of calabasitas and it was ...TO...DIE...FOR!!!  The sauce really complimented the various seafood and not one of the ingredients overpowered any other.    The birthday girl opted for the carne asada tacos with spicy fries....spicy? Not so much...but very tasty!    We were stuffed.  But...it was my friend's birthday so we had to have some dessert!  We looked over the menu and before we could finish deciding, they brought over the best flan I have ever had in my life!  The consistency was ideal and it was covered with this caramel sauce and candied pecans.  Needless to say, we made room for the flan!    We were beyond satisfied with our meal, however...the service we received left a lot to be desired.  I found myself envious of the other tables who were greeted with smiles and had a server that waited for his customers to finish their sentences.  Ours made us feel as if we were a burden and he had better things to do.  He never acknowledged our orders and just walked away when we finished...almost before we finished and was always looking around instead of making eye contact.    I will be back and hopefully the service I receive will warrant me doing the well-deserved 5-star marking for this place!  Thank you Chef Silvana!  You are a gem in the Valley of the Sun!

Get the Hog and the Chick! No wait... The Chop and the chick...NOOO, get the special! Ok. Just get it all!! Thick cut bacon, fresh squeezed orange juice, crispy has browns, fresh preserves on sourdough toast.  Oh man, is this place good. Yes, you might have to wait a while to get seated in this TINY place, but it is worth it!   The service is very friendly and very quick.  I enjoy sitting along the window with their cute little knick knacks.    I hear the lunch menu is just as good at breakfast, but I have yet to try.  I honestly wish this place was open for dinner..."brinner" is my favorite meal! ;-)

Wow! Super busy today! I guess the rain drove everyone in to Ikea for the day!   Per the usual, I grabbed a tasty frozen yogurt and my go-to Lingonberry drink!   We shopped the day away and made my wish list for the fall! Can't wait to go back and refurnish my apartment!  Their prices are always reasonable and the staff is friendly.    Have fun! I love Ikea!

It's a great store...the only gripe is that the lines are always super long and there is sometimes only one register open.   Now for the good schtuff...I appreciate the fact that there are always 50% off sales.  Whether it is wall art, glassware, fabric or other decor themes!  Being a teacher, I am always on the look out for good deals for craft ideas to do in my classroom.  Considering I pay out of pocket for these things...it's great to have a place to go that has good deals.  Suggestion:  follow suit with other craft stores and offer an educator discount!  Any little bit helps!

How I wish I could give this place a 5 star review for their happy hour!  More on that later!  Our grade level team decided to venture to CJ for our holiday happy hour. (Prices are from $2.00-$7.00) Super glad we did!  Their Happy Hour menu is phenomenal!  Choices ranging from the typical happy hour fare of wings and things...but Irish Nachos?  Yes...shoestring fries topped with cheese and bacon! Mouthwatering and finger-licking good! Their calamari is superb!  It is not your typical tentacle and ring type cuts, this is cut from the true meat of the calamari (steak similar to the calamari steak sandwich at Hula's!)    Now...(Please stay seated until the entirety of this review is read because I have a feeling some of you may run to CJ after this)  Fried.  Mac. And.  Cheese.  Yes. I said Fried.  Mac.  And.  Cheese.  It's like a wedge of mac and cheese dipped into this super crispy crust like wrapping and deep fried served with this tangy spicy sauce thing.  I refuse to learn the nutritional facts of this decadence in a wedge, because I probably wouldn't ever eat it again...but it's DELICIOUS!  I also had the shrimp ceviche and they give you WAY more chips than you need...and not enough of the shrimp ceviche.  It's very tasty and very meaty...they don't skimp on that, but the portion could have been a bit more as I was craving it still.   As for the drinks...great prices on beer and cocktails...again ranging from $3-$6  Now for the reason I won't give 5 stars...they don't have seating inside the bar for a party greater than 4.  We had to sit at 2 separate tables which ended up being okay.    Here it is.  Our server.  She complained to the hostess that she wasn't even supposed to be our server right off the bat...and in front of us.  THEN...we are a funny bunch, I mean we are in a room with 20-30 9 and 10 yr olds all day so get us around adults and we let loose.  However, she wasn't amused...at all.  She wouldn't crack a smile.  She just stood there impatiently trying to force us to order.  Don't get me wrong, we weren't being rude to her, we were just being funny and it wasn't anything abnormal or inappropriate.  She just wasn't having it.  When we mentioned we needed separate checks, of course she mumbled and we could tell she wasn't happy.  We asked nicely.    Anywhooo...the food is great, the prices are perfect for Happy Hour...but next time, I hope our server is as goofy and as fun as we are...or at least is tolerant of us!  ;-)

My 5 stars is for the fact that I passed by the location last night and THEY ARE RE-OPENING!!!  No word on when...but there is evidence outside that they are already working on it and the sign just says "OPENING SOON!"  Thank goodness!!!!  The food may not be the greatest, but this place became a favorite hangout and "neighborhood watering hole" for friends and I! Not many sports bars like this in the West Valley.  I no longer have to have a moment of silence and "pour one out for the homies" every time I pass by! Now I can smile and start the countdown to OPENING DAY! Hope it's just in time for football season!

I absolutely LOVE this place!  It has ruined quite a few other sandwich places for me.  The bread is fantastic! I love the way that they slice the meat for you..makes it even more fresh!  The fact that they even have a new coke machine and GINGER ALE...yeah, it's amazeballs!

My favorite place for a Salmon Caesar Salad anywhere! I always order extra croutons.  I have strayed from my comfort zone and ordered the hummus plate which was yummmmmyy!  The food is consistently on point, the tea is refreshing, and you can't walk out with wanting to buy a loaf of bread and a few desserts! Enjoy!!!

So...I hate to do this.  I have to say I cheated.  Yes, I know it's wrong, but I couldn't help myself.  I cheated on my Salmon Caesar salad and had a very hot date with Kale Salad.  I don't know what to do.  I'm in love with two salads at once.  I mean can you blame me? The Kale Salad has feta cheese, grapes, dried corn, sunflower seeds that add just the right crunchy texture and diced red peppers.  The finishing touch is this cilantro lime dressing that is not creamy but a vinaigrette.    I'm a cheater.  You know what? I don't care! I'm going to be doing it over and over again!

Went back AGAIN and I cheated AGAIN!    This time, I had the Harvest Kale Salad and AGAIN my deepest desires were fulfilled.  Yes, I was moaning as I ate...but I couldn't help myself.  Kale, roasted sweet potatoes, apples, BACON, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, green beans, apple cider vinaigrette, and so much more goodness on one plate.  I think I need a giant A to wear on my shirt!  Hell, I'll just wear a big W for WILDFLOWER!  She has become my mistress!

This is not a place I will return.  They are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design, they look at you like you're crazy.  My designs came out absolutely horrid and I ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish.

The 2 stars is mainly for the service.  They were extremely slow!  I have visited other Chipotle locations and even when there's a line, they are fast and friendly.  When I finally got to the register, the girl at the register had to ask me 3 times what I ordered and even though I told her 4 times that I wanted a large drink, she kept handing me the small drink.  Maybe it was because she was more concerned with a co-worker (who had either just gotten off of work or was on break) telling her a story about a friend of his who was having a baby.  It was pretty ridiculous considering the growing line of customers behind me.    The food as usual is delicious! Can never go wrong with a chicken burrito bowl!  However, the guy who was taking the order was in a huge hurry (there was a long line as usual during lunch) and put less than 1/2 the amount of rice and beans than what is usually put into the bowl.  I had to ask for a little more of each.  When I asked for extra lettuce, the girl putting it on gave me a look like "Really?" and begrudgingly gave me extra lettuce.    I think I will be heading east to the Chipotle in Avondale next time.  I've never had a problem at that location.  P.S.  Parking is not the greatest here!

Tacos! Tacos! They're not just for Tuesday!!!  I had been looking for a place like this for a very long time.  Growing up in Las Cruces, NM, we'd frequent El Taco Tote in El Paso whenever we had to go to the airport.  Now...there is one here in Phoenix!  Delicious carne asada tacos and the BEST baked potatoes EVERRR!!  Plentiful salsa bar with all the fixings: cilantro, pickled onions, jalapeños, and all the salsa variety you could ask for.    Make sure you stop by!

I work down the street from this location and I'm glad I do! They have a good selection of pupusas and all of the ones I have tasted haven't let me down.  My favorites are the chicharon and queso as well as the shrimp pupusa.  They are served with some tasty black beans and some rice.  Both of these are very different from what you get in a Mexican restaurant.    To drink I ordered horchata, which I guess in El Salvador is different from Mexico.  It has a slightly nuttier flavor but it's still very good and refreshing.    Next time we go back, we will try one of their entrees (with a couple pupusas on the side) and see what else this Salvadorean cuisine has to offer! If it's anything like the pupusas, I am sure to be satisfied!

After months of saying I wanted to go...I finally went.    I am grateful for the complimentary valet...yet shameful of the condition of my car! ;-)    I enjoyed a lovely Saturday brunch with a good friend and had a damn tasty bloody mary...yummmm!  The tomato baked eggs...just do it.  You won't be sorry.     I would have given this place 5 stars, but the service on this particular day was quite lackluster.  It took a long time to even come take our drink/food orders even when the tables around us were getting taken care of rather quickly.

They do have some really cute stuff, but this whole new pricing thing...it blows.  Things were so much more less expensive before...  However, if they'd follow suit with other JCP's and add a Sephora...I'd be there weekly!

Eat here!! Try the Ahi Tuna Sandwich. It is melt in your mouth delicious! The onion rings are super crunchy and flavorful.   The use fresh produce that is grown right outside and use locally raised beef and chicken. Which is refreshing.   Other suggestions I have are: Fontina Burger and the Sweet Potato Fries (the sweet dipping sauce for these needs to be jarred and sold!),   It's a cool little place with huge personality...even in the bathroom.  They have their condiment and drink station on the outside which is different.  If the weather is right, enjoy your meal outside under the giant tree (it's actually pretty cool!)  For me, it's quite the drive, but it is well worth it.

As usual, this place is delicious! Tried the Southwest Burger and wanted more.  The onion rings were delicious as usual and this is coming from a person who despises onions!   Yay for Joe's! Always fresh and always delicious!

I love coming to Tempe Marketplace...I just HATE the traffic.  Last night, it took me 15 minutes to get into the parking lot from the light on McClintok and Tempe Marketplace .  That does not include the other 10 minutes it took to get a parking.    Other than that, the place is great.  Huge variety of stores, bars, restaurants and the movie theater is ginormous!  Public restrooms are clean which is a huge bonus.  We enjoyed some frozen yogurt on the couches in front of the fire by Barnes and Noble while listening to some guys perform.  (Very talented guys as well).

Salvatore Pizza: Thin crust, prosciutto, arugula...etc etc. You can't go wrong here.  This pizza was savory and the flavors married very well together.    Rigatoni al Forno: I can't do it justice. Pair it with some white wine and you are GOLDEN!  Super friendly staff that are there to answer questions for you as needed!   I suggest getting a pizza and a pasta dish and sharing that way you can have some cannoli or zeppoli for dessert!

LOVE this place.  Always a wait...but it's worth it!   This time I went with the "Do it yourself" Omelet.  I ordered asparagus, feta, and tomato and the waitress whispered..."Why don't you add some jalapeño in there?" So I did and I am glad I listened to her.  The omelet was huge and the veggies were cooked perfectly! I ordered the hash browns extra crispy and I think they may have forgotten...they were still good though!   To drink I went with the strawberry lemonade with rosemary.  DELISH!    My friend had the Wolfpack Club.  It is a bit on the pricy side...but he tends to never get full and for the first time in a while I heard him say, "Well...that was enough! Weird!" ;-)  Not much talking at the table so I'm assuming he also enjoyed his meal!    Can't wait to go back and try some sweet pancakes.  First visit there, I had the brioche french toast with caramelized bananas and nuts and that is so decadently delicious as well!  Enjoy!

I LOVE THIS THEATER!  It's usually not that busy (we went on New Year's Day so it was a bit more busy than usual), but still beats other locations that are overrun with attitude filled teenagers!  It's also kept very clean!  Outdoor ticket kiosks are great so you can avoid the indecisiveness of some patrons.  Push a few buttons, slide your card, grab your ticket and go!    They had PLENTY of lines open at concession and were filling orders very quickly and with a smile on their faces.    Popcorn is the bomb and of course they have FREE seasonings! Yes...FREE!    The only thing I will say is starting this year...loyalty cup refills are now going to be $1.50 as opposed to $1.  It's okay...better than paying $4.00 a visit!  I love how the staff is always waiting to clean the theater as soon as the movie is over and they thank you for coming and are just happy and seem to really like their jobs!  Thanks Harkins for always making movie going experience enjoyable and problem free!

Every single time I walk into this place it's as if they Angels sing!  Make up? Yes please! Fragrance? Yes Please...give me more!  It's all there...in one place! Primers! Lip Stains! Mascara! Liners and brushes! It's like crack for me.  Hi.  My name is Ella and I'm an addict...  The gals and guys here are very helpful when I'm searching for a new mascara or fragrance.    I truly appreciate the fact that they will give you samples of any fragrance to take home and try it before you buy it.  This lets me weed out the granny smelling scents from the ones I know will "bring the boys to the yard..."  Make up consultations are always helpful too!  They won't make you look like a triflin' porn star either...I mean, unless that's what you want!

Ok...so I know I have said this before, but this is legit.    These are the best tacos in the valley...perhaps anywhere! It wouldn't have even happened had Fajardo's Cafe been open! We had driven out to Glendale and it was closed, so I jumped on Yelp and this place came up!    It's a very small place and if I hadn't read Floyd C's review, I probably wouldn't have found it! (Thanks, Floyd!!!)  It is on the north east corner of 59th Ave and Camelback.  However, it is facing 59th avenue...yeah.  we drove around a few times...then read the review! Oh....gotta love random adventures leading to a diamond in the rough!  You go up to the counter, order...and they hand you a little plate to fill with all of the fixings they have at the salsa bar...which to be honest...they're all AMAZING!!!!  Plus, they have cucumbers, lettuce, onion/cilantro mix, carrots and limes! LIMES!! Remember...I have a lime fetish.    ***the ONLY complaint I have...and it is not even that big of a deal and I won't be taking any stars away is that they don't have cilantro alone...I hate raw onions. Like to the point of having a close to "ick" reaction! *** Anywhoooo...  I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a lengua taco with a side of beans.  The lengua (tongue...yes tongue) is absolutely flavorful and SOOOOOOOOO tender!  The carne asada is probably the most flavorful I have ever had here in the valley!  The beans are amazing and super yummy...it seems to me that they have chorizo and cheese in them.    The service is quick and not so personable, but not rude at all! They are busy and are pretty much just making sure to get everyone their orders!  We will be back! Every Tuesday! ;-)  Wanna know how much we enjoyed our meal?  We each ordered a carne asada burrito to go...for lunch tomorrow!  We never do that!    So who is up for Taco Wednesday? Thursday? Any day that ends in "Y"??

Love it!  Great Happy Hour and yummy rolls.  I am a fan of the Tootsie Roll and the crunchy roll.  They are very friendly and accommodated a large group of us for a birthday happy hour in the middle of the week. You know how when you show up with a big party and you ask the dreaded question...dun dun duuunnnn..."Can you give us separate checks?"  That look of horror and disgust usually crosses the face of your server?  Not here...he happily gave us all separate checks and didn't make a single mistake.    Our sushi chef for the evening was Santiago...a couple of us who went to Nakama tonight used to frequent a sushi bar called Fish Market back in the day (a moment of silence for the best caterpillar roll in existence...oh the shrimp tempura roll too!)  and Santiago used to work there.  He still remembers us and is probably the friendliest sushi chef around!    I have been to Nakama SEVERAL times and have never...EVER left disappointed!  Everyone is always friendly and the food is always good.    See you next week...happy hour!

Accidentally showed up during happy hour and that was great!    They have little tapas dishes for under $2.00.  Perfect little appetizer before having one of their yummy gyros! I always have to order extra tzatziki,not because there isn't enough on the gyro, but because it's pretty damn tasty!   My friend had their Chicken Pasta Salad and as usual, it was delicious.  I was sad to see that they didn't have their tomato basil soup this time.  I dream about this soup. I crave it. There is just something about this soup that makes you feel all fuzzy and warm inside!  I will order this soup even if it is 115 degrees outside! The kicker...their fresh pita chips that are served with this soup!   Yummy!

Nestled amongst all the carnicerias, filibertos, eribertos, davidbertos, etc-bertos is a little diamond in the rough neighborhood known as "Maryvale".    75 Thai is the bomb-diggity! Ok, so I have really only ever had one entree  (even though I've been there a dozen or so times) but still it's delicious.    I can speak on the Chicken Pad Woon-Sen.  Flavor, flavor, FLAVOR! The veggies and glass noodles are delicious and the chicken is always tender.  Of course you can order it with beef, pork, or shrimp as well.    When my "techie" friends and I go, they always order family style and order different menus and share.  There have never been any complaints about any of the dishes they have tried!  However, there are a couple of us at the table who are given grief and called stingy because we just don't like to share (mostly because we like our leftovers!)  Meaning...HUGE servings!    I suggest starting off with their veggie spring rolls that are served with a savory sauce for dipping and always get extra rice! Oh, don't forget the Thai tea!   The place is not too big or too small.  The owner is also your server, bus boy, and cashier!  He is very quiet and soft spoken but very friendly! I'm lucky enough to work within 5 minutes so maybe next time I'll venture and try something new...but that Pad Woon Sen always calls my name!

Get the carne asada torta! It's just perfect! The telera bread (the traditional bread used to make a torta for those of you that don't know) is toasted to perfection!  For me, that is a must when having a torta!  Their carne asada is tender and flavorful and topped with jalapeños and avocado, lettuce and tomato.   My friend ordered the carne asada tacos and to be honest, this was the quietest dinner we had shared in a long time.  The food was so good we forgot the other one was there!    We ordered a side of refried beans that was the ideal size for sharing and they were creamy and super tasty.    Do yourself a favor and order a horchata...but be warned, that when you order a large, it's not just any large....it's a L-A-R-G-E.  :-)   Can't wait to go back and try some more items on their menu! :-)

Why did I wait so long to try this!   This is no typical torta joint!  This place has a plethora (do I get extra points for using this word?) of tastiness on the menu!  Tortas, tacos, ice cream, all these other dessert choices...AND....a little bakery!   All of their agua frescas are amazingly tasty...not too sweet at all!  I had agua limon and I wanted more!    Very clean and very friendly service!  Great little salsa bar and just yummy all around!

If you are craving that slice of greasy pizza that has flavor and a pretty decent crust, then this is the place for you.  Not to mention, their pizzas are HUGE! It was one of those days where I just wanted pizza.  Not just any old pizza (delivery or Digiornos (sp?)), but a good slice of plain ol' PEPPERONI pizza! This place did not disappoint.  The pepperoni was tasty, plentiful, and a bit spicy, the crust was YUMMY and thin, I'm not a fan of deep dish or thick crusted pizzas.    Also, their wings are pretty tasty too and they don't come from the anorexic chickens that another establishment (Native something or other) makes their wings from.  They  have good flavor and a bit of a bite if you order the hot.  From what I could see, they also have a pretty serious competition going on to see who can survive their spiciest flavor! I guess you get them free and even earn a shirt!   I had been to Daddy Duke's before and had one of their many pasta dishes which was delicious as well.  The staff (I think they are all family) are very friendly and helpful.    My one and only criticism of this place is one of their desserts.  We got an order of "Daddy Duke's Fun Cakes" for free for checking in on Yelp...and they weren't that fun.  It's pretty much just pizza dough drowning in powdered sugar.  That however, will not keep me from coming back! The prices are reasonable and the food is flavorful!

Eggs Benny...yummmmy!  I had never been there before and it was much needed after a night of excessive drinking!  I love the set up...you stand in line to order and then find your seat.  We found a few seats and the bar against the window and bellied up.  Loved the homestyle potatoes as well.   Looking forward to going back and trying the brizza...breakfast pizza!

Best sushi I've had in a long time! HUGE variety of rolls and special rolls.  The waiter impressed me by rattling off a list of 7 or 8 specialty, off the menu rolls that they had available that night.  We decided to each try one of them.  I had the Sun Devil roll which had eel, crab, cream cheese and topped with spicy tuna, fresh jalapeño, and a spicy sauce.  Melt in your mouth delicious!  One of my friends ordered a roll (can't remember the name), but it had shitake mushrooms on top and angus beef! Yeah...BEEF on a sushi roll?  I was afraid to taste it...but I'm so glad I did! The combination of the woodiness of the shitake and the flavor of the beef along with the tuna and crab in the roll...WOW!   I can't forget to mention the edamame.  Not just any edamame, garlic szechuan edamae! It was finger licking good!    In addition to their large sushi menu, they also have quite the impressive cocktail menu! I ordered the Strawberry and basil with sake cocktail and it was excellent!  See you at the sushi bar!

Por favor...someone pass me a napkin.  My mouth is still watering!    This place has been on my list of "must try's" for quite a while.  A friend and I were meeting for lunch elsewhere, when we remembered Central was closed off for the Veteran's Day Parade.  Ok...so I do appreciate the Veteran's for all they have done...but I have to be selfish today and thank them for the parade, because without that, I wouldn't have ended  up at Gallo Blanco!  Was a little busy for lunch, so we sat ourselves at the bar and ordered the most refreshing sangria I have had in a very long time, while we waited for our table.   We were greeted by a very friendly server who brought us some ice water while we finished our sangrias.  We chose to start off simple with some Chips and Salsa.  Salsas.  Not spicy yet BOASTING of flavor! Smokiness...savory...just delicious!  I love the tostadas they use here as well, nice and thick!  I could have eaten just the chips and salsa as my meal!    I couldn't decide what to order and my friend told me that this place had some pretty bangin' carne asada.  I chose to heed her advice and I'm glad I did! I ordered the carne asada torta and HOLY GUACAMOLE!!!  The most tender and flavorful carne asada I've had while I've lived in Phoenix.  The torta was more like a tort-o-my-god!  Jam packed with carne, guac and love!  I pretty much shed a few tears when I was finished.  I kind of hoped I could do a twitch of my nose and make another one appear, but that didn't happen.  I just looked like I was having a severe allergy attack or facial spasms.  :-(  The ambiance is super trendy and fun.  A great mix of clientele from families, businessmen, and hotel guests (since it is in the Hotel Clarendon...super swanky!)  I can't wait to go back for Happy Hour and try some tacos and chips and salsa and sangria and these WICKED looking bloody mary's I saw walking around!    Viva el Gallo Blanco! Ahuuuuaaaaa!

Finding a good place for Asian eats is not easy in the west valley.  Ever since our favorite place closed (we are still in mourning...let's tip the 40 for our homies), we have been searching.  After having read the reviews, we figured we'd give it a shot.  Glad we did!  The decor is fabulous.  Very clean designs and spacious.  Both booths and tables are available.    I ordered the mixed veggies (extra brocoli) and chicken and my best friend ordered the cashew chicken.  For about $8, you get a HUGE serving!  I took most of my meal to go and the server was nice enough to put in some fresh steamed rice.    The flavors were well balanced and the veggies were cooked to perfection....still had that much needed "bite" to them!  Brocoli, snap peas, zucchini, peppers, mushrooms (I asked for no onions), and the chicken was tender!  Make sure you ask for some chile paste!    Try it out...you won't be sorry!

As far as pizza goes, Cici's is fair.  The 5 stars is for the treatment my 4th grade students received when we went there on a field trip.  You may be asking yourself..."A field trip? To Cici's Pizza?"  Why yes! It's all about FRACTIONS!  This is our yearly field trip to close out our unit on fractions.  The kids pay $3.00 and they get a fairly good sized pizza (I think it's their medium) and a drink.  They also get a tour of the kitchen.    When they finish their tour, they are allowed to build their own pizza.  They can put pepperoni's on their pizza however they would like.  They were kind enough to accommodate my student who is a vegetarian and gave her a few veggie options to choose from.  I also asked them to cut each pizza into different fractional parts...some were cut into 6, 8, or 10 pieces.  Each kiddo had to then calculate how much pizza they had eaten and other fun stuff!    Now for the 5 stars...the staff!  They were SOOOOOOOOO friendly and were eager to share their jobs with my kids.  They encouraged them to ask questions and were just plain awesome!  My kids and I (and our parent chaperones) had an amazing time.  The pizza was delicious, as the teacher, I got to make my own...looked horrible, but tasted delicious!    Thank you to the staff at Cici's for  making our field trip so much fun! We had an educational experience but also really had a blast!  Thanks!

Since the closing of B-Dubs next door, this has become more of a favorite hang out! When I was a kid and we'd come to town on vacation (and I had a huge crush on Thunder Dan), we'd always go to the downtown location.  Now that I live in the West Valley and Majerle's is a 5 minute drive...I'm there often!  As mentioned in a few other reviews, the Gorilla Wings live up to their name! They're huge in size and in flavor.  The Buffalo Shrimp appetizer is freakin' phenomenal as well! You can get any of their sauces on the shrimp, so you can try something different each time.  Their fries are awesome, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.    As for entrees, they have a killer Ruben sandwich and their pastas are really good as well.    A full bar and wall to wall tv's makes this a great place to catch a game any night of the week.    I'm still waiting to catch a glimpse of Thunder Dan himself, and hopefully this time I won't make a food out of myself and completely freeze up like the one time I met him! ;-)

Love this place! So convenient and I always find something new to try!!   This is my go-to place when I am in a rush for something to cook up for dinner!  They have great prices on produce and meat.  I love the pumpkin bagels when they have them.    Very clean and the staff is always friendly.  Plus, every time I shop here and spend more than $20 I earn money for my school.    Their store brand salsas are delicious with their lime flavored chips.

I can't begin to tell you how awesome this place is! The servers are friendly and the food is to die for!   I went with my friends for my birthday and I was kind of nervous with there being 16 of us.  Often times, splitting checks, ordering etc can be a bear with a large party.  Not at Hula's.  Water and drinks were kept full and she was always checking on us.  I even got a bowl of the most amazing ice cream with macadamia nuts in it...with a candle! ;-)   It's not often that everyone at the table enjoys their food...but it happened last night!  I ordered the calamari sandwich which was delicious.  The calamari steak was sliced and on a sandwich topped with some really good slaw.  I asked the waitress which of the fries were better and she suggested that I just mix them which I did.  The regular fries were good, but man oh man...the sweet potato fries were fantastic!  We started with some spicy edamame...take my advice and order some of it next time! You won't be sorry!  As far as cocktails go, I am not a fan of super sweet drinks so I asked our server what she suggested.  I went with her suggestion and ordered the Blood Orange Martini and ended up have 2 of them.    All in all, Hula's made my birthday celebration very special and everyone enjoyed their time there!  We'll definitely be going back!!!

Seriously some of the best wings I've had...I was able to taste them after having bar hopped with a great friend.  They have the biggest selection of sauces I have ever seen!  The wings are huge and they do not skimp on this sauce!  Fries were crispy and tasty...service was quick and beer was cold.  I mean what more can you ask for.    They have a huge patio and you can sit at the bar while still sitting outside which is great at this time of the year in AZ!

One of my absolute fave places to sit out on the patio and enjoy a cold bottle of Mexican coca cola and some carne asada!   I've had the torta, I've had the tacos, I've had the pastor.  All of these are stellar!  This last time, I finally tried the Elote! A cob of sweet corn covered in crema and queso! I can't explain how delicious this is...it is beyond words!  Taco Tuesday is now Taco-Elote Tuesday!    Never have I ever...been disappointed at America's!!!!

So I used to be a big fan of SB coffee...then I found elsewhere.  I got a gift card for Christmas and decided to go in and grab my old "usual"...a venti Americano with room.    When I walked in at 7:25 in the morning, there was not a soul in the place...the drive thru was full, but inside was empty.  First of all, the girl at the counter looked as if she had no idea what she was doing.  She was talking to someone else and I had to repeat my order 3 times because she was more concerned with her sidebar conversation than a paying customer.    She asked my name...another 3 times, which I spelled it (because she asked) and she still spelled it wrong.    Now, here's the kicker...as I made my way to the other end of the counter to pick up my "coffee" my bagel had finished toasting.  A different girl gave me two small bags; one with my bagel, the other with the cream cheese and a knife.  I also got a sandwich for lunch.  So at this point, I had 2 bags and a box.  5 minutes later...a few people had already walked in and ordered.  I was still waiting.  There were 4 girls total behind the counter.  I still had no coffee.  The woman behind me made a comment about how it was taking forever and I agreed...yet not a single person behind the counter acknowledged the now 5 people waiting for their orders.    After a few more minutes, I finally got my drink.  I had to ask for a small bag and got some attitude from the barista.  There was NO acknowledgement for the near 10 minutes that I had to wait for a drink.  NONE!  I packed up my lunch and went to fix up my drink...and bolted out of this place.  When I finally took a drink, my coffee tasted absolutely BURNT...legit nasty! I dumped the entire venti cup out...NEVER.  NEVER again!!!  The service was crap and the coffee was crappier.  Sorry, but it's true.  I have deleted my app and they can have their gold level member back.  If I ever get a gift card, I'll give it away or use it to scrape something off of somewhere.

This place has great lunch specials! I have never been disappointed in the pizza here!    Tons of toppings on my fave...Joey's favorite (minus the onions). Their antipasto is to die for with tons of flavor and endless goodness!   My boyfriend loved the pizza and the wings!

Three cheers for FroYo!    Always a variety of flavors (although I wish they kept Taro around all the time instead of sporadically).   They have flavors ranging from sweet to tart! The toppings are awesome! Mochi, lychee, mandarin oranges, fresh fruit, these little sunflower seed things that I love! They also have typical toppings like chocolate chips, nuts, etc etc ETC! There is no shortage of toppings here.  It is always pretty busy with the movie theater nearby, but it's worth it.  You can catch a movie and bring your ticket stub in for 3 free ounces after the flick.   You might feel overwhelmed with all of the flavors so feel free to ask for a few sample cups! While you enjoy your yogurt, grab a free cup of water, it's usually flavored with fresh fruit!   Enjoy!

This is a GREAT place for Happy Hour!   Drinks are 1/2 price as are appetizers.  They are always accommodating of large groups.  The choices for appetizers can pretty much be a full meal...even to share!  I will never ride the bull but I will always point and laugh at the person riding and then falling off!

Creamy, homemade goodness!  Fantastical service and deliciousness all in one!  As a first timer, I was given a brief rundown of the offerings! Sampled more than I should have...hehehe!  I chose to go with the citrus cream cheese! This has to some of the best ice cream I've ever had.  Very cream cheesy with bits of citrus zest throughout!  The waffle cone (thanks Yelp!) is also homemade and VERY thin, which I love.  I had a super thick and overpowering waffle cone.    Very friendly, very clean, very good!

Ok...so after a few minutes of trying to find this place, we stepped into heaven.  There is no lighted sign or really any lights outside to tell you where it is, but we found it.  We walked in to a very busy place.  The bff and I stood there trying to figure out what we wanted and couldn't decide.  We thought we had figured it all out when we decided one of us would get the pulled pork sandwich and the other would get the brisket...only to find out they were all out of pork!  Must be good and that just means we will have to make the journey out there again!  We each got the brisket and WOW! It was tender and very flavorful.  They have several sauces to choose from.  I went with the mustard bbq and the Crazy (something or other...I can't remember the name).  The mustard bbq sauce was perfect for the brisket.  Just the right amount of tang and spice.  For my two sides I chose the mac n cheese and waffle fries...starch much?  The fries were good and the mac n cheese was really tasty...nothing froo froo or fancy about it.  Just straight up mac n cheese!   The menu isn't huge, but the smell is intoxicating enough to lead you to confusion that will mess with you and your decision making abilities!    I didn't mean to be a nosey-rosey but I did look at other patrons' plates and everything in the place looks delicious...the ribs, the chicken...I can't wait to go back and try some more!  Thanks to Yelp, I got a free drink!  Oh and as for the name...when I was finished with my meal, you could have put a fork in me and I would have been "pork on a fork!"  I don't regret it and don't judge me...it's the holidays! Screw the diets!

WARNING!  Might be offensive to those with no sense of humor!    If I could give 10 dogs...I mean stars I would!  I had heard a lot of good things about this place and figured I'd give it a try...despite the LONGEST line ever.  As we approached the menu I felt this wave of anxiety wash over me.  I mean how many different toppings can you put on a hot dog.  Wait? Did I read that correctly? Cracker Jacks? Peanut Butter? BACON? GOUDA...on the same hot dog?  Um...yummy???    Ok. so I wasn't as adventurous as my best friend...I opted for the spicy beer dog with sauerkraut, spicy mustard, cilantro, jalapenos, tomatoes, and smoked gouda.  Wrapped in not a typical hot dog bun, but in this soft pita type bread.  I was in love.    My best friend went for it though...she ordered THE BEAR!  Beef dog, peanut butter, bbq sauce, smoked gouda, cracker jacks....I took a bite and instantly had weiner envy!  (hehehe)  The peanut butter gave it this asian/thai/korean type of flavor.  It was delicious! Next time I'm going back to have the mango chutney/cilantro dog.    Ok...I know I keep rambling and this review is poorly written, but as I write I keep remembering all of the goodness that goes on in this little food truck.  As for the weiners...(the following has a rating of PG-13 due to some innuendos and connotations that could be inferred) they have that casing that as soon as you put the weiner in your mouth...well, it kinda snaps/pops!  Then all the flavorful goodness just begins to take over your tastebuds and well, I can't speak for everyone here, but I got this warm and fuzzy feeling searing through my body!  I had to take a moment to savor this feeling as I wasn't sure when I would experience it again!  Woooo-sahhhhhh.  This was like being on a date with Shemar Moore...I just wanted to take that dog in my hand and say "Hey baby girl...how youuuu doin?"  Ok so I mixed a little Joey Tribiani in there as well!  Anyway...the dude at the window was super friendly and very patient with my inability to just make a damn decision!  The line moved fairly quickly and the wait for the food wasn't long at all!    Oh did I mention that their corn dogs look like a giant fried piece of heaven?  There's always next time....

Quaint and sinfully delicious!!! The owner is very friendly and is proud of what he has built. As he should be.   I had a hard time choosing, but went with the peanut butter chocolate cupcake (you can't go wrong with that!) and the caramel frap cupcake.  To die for. The cupcakes are perfectly moist and the frosting is not overpowering as you find in many other establishments.   I will be going back tomorrow to pick some more cupcakes up for a get together I'm attending on Sunday. I might even try their Blue Moon flavor!   What a gem we have on the west side!!

Taco Tuesday has a new home!    Everything was fresh and very authentic.  I tried a few different tacos from shrimp to fish to carne asada.  Each of them cooked to perfection with some salsa that paired well with each of the taco fillings.    I mean honestly...this place is awesome.  I keep telling myself that I will try a burrito (HUGE) next time, but me being a creature of habit will probably just have fish tacos again!    Do yourself a favor, head over to Tacos Atoyac and BUEN PROVECHO!

FANTASTIC place to take a class on a field trip.  My 5th graders were absolutely loving all of the interactive displays that they have.  Their docents are friendly and knowledgeable as well.  My students were encouraged to ask questions and just have fun!

If I could figure out how to get my mouth to stop watering just thinking about this place...I'll start the review.  Hold please!   Ok...I think I can do this.  OH. MY. GOSH!  I have been to Mellow Mushroom a few times and I can't tell you enough, how absolutely delicious this place is!  The first time I went, my friend and I shared a Greek Salad and a large Kosmic Karma pizza.  The Greek Salad is superb! (I, of course, removed the raw onions), but seriously, this thing was loaded with flavor! Lots of Feta cheese, kalamata olives, banana peppers and a very light but tasty dressing...WOW! Was perfect for a warm spring day in Arizona!    Now on to the pizza...Kosmic Karma! Karma is not a B...it is a party in your mouth.  A very simple pizza, red sauce, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, and the pies de resistance...the most beautiful swirl of pesto that encompasses all the flavors into one pie of perfection! Oh but wait! That's not the kicker...THE CRUST! You know it's a good crust when you hear it crunch when you bite and then all of a sudden it's just that perfect soft doughy-ness that you have always wanted? Yeah..that's it! Seriously!   So that was just the one visit!  My most recent vist was just a couple of weeks ago after a hellacious week of learning and thinking...we just needed some time to unwind and Mellow Mushroom was the perfect spot for myself and a couple of girlfriends to relax and enjoy some mindless chatter and good food!    Upon suggestion of one of the girls, we started off with the garlic pretzels, which to my surprise and complete satisfaction...are made of...THE CRUST! *insert teenage Bieber fan squeee here* Yes folks, you read correctly...THE CRUST that is perfection in my book! Garlicy and doughy and crusty crust with a side of very tasty marinara dipping sauce! For like $3.50 you get 3 full size soft pretzels.  Not bad at all.    Then came the pizza! I am a creature of habit and ordered the Kosmic Karma.  I believe that what comes around goes around and I wanted to see that pesto swirl go around my pizza pie one more time! I wasn't let down either! It was another one of those moments where you end up making those "happy food" noises while eating.  No shame! I noticed my two friends were doing the same! One ordered the Philosopher's pie (steak, portabello mushrooms, artichokes) and the other ordered the Caesar  (literally a Caesar salad on a garlic pesto based sauce).  We left with our leftovers and I can say I was just as giddy to have them the next day as I was when it was first brought to the table! (Just make sure you heat them up in the oven so they don't have that nasty microvwav  Needless to say, we were very happy! They really need to make one of these places on the West Side!  It's worth the drive though!

Cute little place!  Very random, but creative flavors.  My niece and nephew were in town for a couple of weeks and I needed somewhere cute to take them...found it!  They LOVED the homemade ice cream nestled in between some pretty darn good cookies!  Ok...fine...so did I!  Everything seems as if it homemade and the staff is extremely friendly!  Love the decor as well.  Very fun and welcoming!

I was excited to see that there was going to be another yogurt place in the west valley.  Sadly, it wasn't as great as I had hoped.    The flavors are ok, their toppings are nothing compared to other yogurt places in the area.  The staff (on all 3 occasions that I have been there) are not friendly at all.  Usually a teenager who is upset that you interrupted their texting.

Not the greatest Mexican food in the valley but DEFINITELY not the worst!  This is what I can compare to comfort food.  The service is great and the chips and salsa are pretty damn tasty!  There is a lot of cheese, of which I ask them to go light on and pretty Sonoran inspired.    Wednesdays is all you can eat tacos and enchiladas.  Grab a beer and enjoy the laughs!

Absolutely one of the best times I've had.  I am probably the world's worst artist!  I can't even draw stick figures.    Here, with my bottles of wine...yeah I said bottles. I was able to create my very own masterpiece!  The instructors are uber friendly and patient.  I wanted to change up the colors on mine and it was absolutely okay to do so.    I was there for a friend's birthday, and had a blast!    Just show up, bottle in hand and they do the rest.  They provide everything you need and create a very open and fun environment!  Can't wait to go back!

My memories of having frybread come from going to the New Mexico State Fair in Albuquerque every year as a kid.  On the 3 hour drive up from Las Cruces, my mouth would already be watering.  The perfect mix of chile colorado con carne, beans, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and salsa placed ever so tenderly on top of a delicious frybread.    Well, it was recreated when I took the first bite of my Buckeye Frybread. Red Chile AND green chile!  So flavorful and reminded me of home.  I also have to add that their red salsa is almost...almost as good as my dad makes!  I have no idea why it took me so long to get there...but I know it will be on our go-to place list from now on!  I will be spreading the word as well!   What a hidden gem in Avondale!!!!

Was really disappointed today.    The girl at the front was totally distracted and looking around while taking my order.  I think I had like one slice of turkey on my sandwich.  I always order no mayo here because they seem to like to overdo it...so today I ordered dijon mustard and there was hardly any at all.    Usually this place is really good, but not today.  I will go back and see if maybe today was just "one of those days".

I want to be buried here.   Super friendly and very helpful people.  I was trying to figure out what I could mix Pumpkin Pie Vodka with and the manager hopped on the computer and helped me figure it out!    They were sampling Blood Orange martinis, whiskey, wine, Grand Marnier...I mean it's like Costco for grown ups.  Love it.

Spend my 2nd Saturday at this facility for an Arizona K-12 Center event.   This place is very clean, facilities are well kept and the food is always good!    One thing I appreciate is the fact that the temperature is kept pretty comfortable.  I have been to conferences and such at which the rooms are usually FREEZING!    The friendly wait staff is always walking around to make sure food is kept full and clearing tables.

Beer.  I love beer.  They have a pretty big selection and a pretty decent happy hour.  We tried a few items on the menu including the Scotch eggs!  Delicious!  I had a pretty amazing sandwich that was more than I could eat.    Everyone I was with really enjoyed their meals and their drinks.  We will definitely be going back!

The smoothies are delicious and the sandwiches, wraps, and flatbreads are flavorful!   As I've mentioned in other reviews, I am a creature of habit...so I usually get the Blimey Limey which is sooooo yummy!  On a recent visit, I stepped out of the box and ordered a Sunrise Sunset smoothie (of course I added LIME!) and it is now my new go-to smoothie.    The Hummus Veggie wrap is super tasty, however I'll be asking for more hummus next time!   Make sure you stop by! It's the perfect way to enjoy a healthy meal and a cool smoothie on a hot Arizona summer day!

Wanted to have a couple of Margaritas in honor of the National Holiday ;-)  Margaritas were decent...for pre-prepared stuff. Salsa...not so much.  It was tomato juice with some chopped up jalapenos...if that.   The service is what lacked. A lot.  They had the bartender tending bar and taking care of all of the customers.  You could tell he was a bit overwhelmed and was annoyed when asked for anything.  Everything took forever.  Once he finally brought out our checks, we waited another 15-20 for him to pick them up and run them.  I know it wasn't his fault, however, management should have taken note and had someone help him run food and such.  He was doing everything and there were quite a few people in the bar as it was happy hour.    One last suggestion, many of us go to happy hour to unwind and enjoy a beverage or two.  Allowing children in the bar is a touchy subject, but one that I think needs to be taken into consideration.  There is plenty of seating in the restaurant area.  Just sayin...

Went for the first time today and had a great experience. Very friendly staff welcomed us and the place is very clean.    The seats are leather and have a swivel "table/tray" attached if you choose to eat lunch or dinner there, which we did.  They have a pretty large menu offering the typical appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, salads and typical movie treats and...WAIT FOR IT....BEER and ALCOHOL!  The nice thing is, you never have to leave your seat, just push the button on your tray, and a very friendly server appears!   I had a burger and beer today (Tuesdays are $2 off burgers and beer).  The burger and fries were tasty and the beer was cold!  I believe they do have other daily specials like $2 off Margaritas on Mondays.    Can't wait to go there again...the movie ticke prices are very affordable and prices for food are comparable to any other restaurant.

Holy Craft Beer Heaven!!!  Seriously...whoever is in charge of the craft beer selection and it's constant rotation is a GENIUS!    Went in the other day and had a De Proef's Dangerously Close to Stupid and it has to be one of the best IPA's I've ever had the opportunity to taste.    Also tried the San Tan Hibiscus Ale which had a very smooth and crisp flavor.  The floral notes were very subtle but made for a refreshing beverage!  I will be going in more often to see what gems they had!  I know this De Proef's is rare, because it only had 4 reviews on Beer Advocate!  Most of the reviews and "hads" were east coast based as well!  I wonder if I can order a keg of that stuff to go??

Absolutely disgusting.  Sorry, but I'm being honest.  I love sushi.  Rolls...sashimi...etc etc and here, it was as if I got sushi out of a vending machine.  It's hard to mess up a spicy tuna roll.  I took one bite and pretty much had to spit it out.    Maybe the "food" is good there, but I will NEVER go there for sushi.    The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  However, I wish the place that used to be in this location was still there.   Again, sushi out of a vending machine.  Ick.

I am completely blaming my dear friend T for introducing me to this place.    I love tea.  I have always wanted to have that euphoric feeling often referred to as Nirvana.  Now...I'm addicted to Teavana.   T...you owe me $61.00.  (well worth it though, my mornings have never been so peaceful thanks to some blossoming tea!)  If you go there...don't blame me!  Just add to the blame I have placed on my friend T!

If I could give 5 stars for just the jalapeño poppers...I totally would.  I wasn't impressed.  At all.  I ordered a burger and shared a prime rib wrap (say that 5 times fast).  My burger was overdone and the wrap was uber soggy.    I was really looking forward to trying the food here after reading the reviews.  It could have just been an off night, and I will definitely give it another chance!  However...these jalapeño poppers are LEGIT!

Sad and disappointed. Was super excited to try a new truck while at Phoestivus tonight. Saw this place had chicken tikka masala and I looked no further. They make sure you know they were on Food Network though they didn't fare very well. Anyway, back to the food! I was really looking forward to having some tikka! Well, I don't know if they were having an off night, but it was highly disappointing. No spice. No flavor. Well, there was flavor, but it was more like a tomato paste than a rich and typically flavorful sauce. This was much more tangy and sour than what I am used to. I have had this dish at several different restaurants and I've never tasted anything even remotely like this. The "basmati" rice was seriously undercooked and came out of my bowl in clumps. I even crunched a few pieces.   I was tempted to take my dish back to them but they had a few people in line so I honestly just ended up throwing 95% of my dish away. Even my 2 friends tasted it and had the same reaction I did.  I didn't leave hungry though, I went to the truck down the way and enjoyed one of my favorite hot dogs!

Nails.  Indulgence? Maybe, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do!    The guy who used to do my nails disappeared...and if you have ever been in this situation, then you know exactly how I feel.  I've been searching high and low for a new place for my nails.  I think I found it.  Super friendly, very clean and they pay attention to details.  They don't try to upsell you or make you feel guilty for saying no.   I went in for a fill and that's just what I got.  I showed her a picture of how I wanted my nails and she did it...exactly how I wanted them!  She told me that if I wasn't happy in the next few days, to come back in and she'd fix them!  I will definitely be a regular here.  (It doesn't hurt AT ALL that it's next door to Yogurtland!)

This used to be me favorite place. Came in a couple weeks ago and saw a lot of new faces. Didn't give it much thought. Until they did my pedicure and fill at the same time. Very awkward. Uncomfortable positions. Twisted neck. A pillow?? No me gusta.    Today. More new faces. It was busy. Saturday afternoon. I understand. I was told 5-10 minutes. 4 girls came in together for pedicures. They had an appointment. Ok. Then another girl came in. She was taken before me. And I was told 1 minute. Which we all know in "nail speak" that means 5. Then a woman and her little girl came in. They were taken before me. After more than 45 minutes of waiting. I walked out. Ridiculous!!!! I completely understand they were busy, but in the past, they'd never have skipped people. I'd have been acknowledged, offered a water...something. I'll be finding a new place. Like right now. I'm literally writing this in the parking lot.

Beachy feel to this place!  Just off of Scottsdale ave, without that Scottsdale feel...thankfully.    Anywhoooo...great beer selection and...they have corona-ritas! HOLLER!  Ok...for the burger.  I got the Hangover Burger.  Green chile (could have been hotter), Bacon (OH THE BACON!), EGG..yeah...an egg!  This thing was delicious!  Onion rings...kinda felt like I needed a crane..these things were HUGE!  The burger had a great flavor and cooked perfectly medium.  Just how I like it.  My bff got the PBJ burger.  Peanut butter, jelly, sriracha...yeah I know right? But damn that thing was good.  Very much like that one dog at Short Leash!  Try it...you'll see!

Great breakfast burrito. Very friendly and not shy on the serving size!!   The tortilla is soft and flavorful and the bacon is nice and thick. I couldn't even eat half of it so I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.  I just wish they gave you more salsa!

Finally! Boba in the west valley!   They have a large variety of smoothies and drinks as well as some DELICIOUS donuts! I of course tried the Taro with boba and not only is it a beautiful shade of my favorite color, purple...it was absolutely DELICIOUS!  My lemon filled donut was also really good.  The young lady working the counter was very friendly and helpful.    I really hope this place makes it! Locally owned and that is what I support!!!

Ok...I am a cheater.  I am a huge fan of the Land of Yogurt in Avondale...mostly because they carry Taro froyo.  However, ever since my friend Carrie told me they have Sriracha sauce as a topping...well I had to see what the hell this was all about.  Obviously I took advantage of the sample cups.  The flavors were varied and pretty tasty.  I am NOT a fan of cookie batter/cake batter type flavors.  I tend to go for the tarts and chocolate options...tonight I did the plain tart and mango.    Now for the toppings...holy toppings batman!  They have a buttload of toppings!  Boba...in many flavors, mochi, nuts, fruit, cereals, candies, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, nuts...go  nuts really!  All kinds of syrups/sauces and the pies de resistance....sriracha!  I did it and it was really weird at first, but I did love it on my mango sorbet and fresh mango pieces.    This place is very clean and very tasty.  The owner came by our table to say hi and took our empty cups.  I'll be back...just suggest to carry taro and fresh lychee once in a while!   Oh! One thing I thought was cool was they had a "menu" of how to create certain concoctions...I don't think I'd ever use it because I'm a "hmmm...that looks good, let's throw that on there" type of person.   Yummy-tini!

I feel human again!  Thanks to Toni and her mad skilllls!   I went in for the first time today to get my eyebrows done.  The service was free because it was my first visit which was a plus!  However, I will be going back to Toni regularly for my waxing needs.  Like mentioned in Carrie's review, Toni uses a hard wax (which has a pretty awesome color...teal hehehe) that I had never had used on me...it makes the process quick and painless.  She was very aware of how I wanted my eyebrows shaped and consistently checked to make sure I was comfortable and happy.    When I was all finished, she applied some cortisone to help lessen the redness that usually occurs after waxing.  I was extremely satisfied and will be going back very soon!    BONUS:  When making your appointment...note the ease! Book your appointment online and you will be done in just a few clicks, followed by a text or email or BOTH reminder a couple of days in advance!    Thanks, Toni!

Brand spankin' new place on the west side.  I was excited when I saw the word Pita because that automatically brings goodies like Gyros and hummus to mind!   I was greeted with a smile by the guy behind the counter.  The menu isn't big, but there is a good selection of Greek deliciousness.  I went with "old faithful" and had a gyro.  I decided on the hummus and pita chips as my side (you can choose from the hummus and pita chips or fries)  The hummus was good and the pita chips were very tasty.  Not too crunchy and not just warmed bread.    Now to the gyro.  Uh..."I believe I ordered the LARGE cappuccino! HELLO!" (If you get that movie reference give yourself a flying knuckle bump with a massive explosion at the end because YOU ROCK!  This thing was HUGE! Fully loaded (I chose no onions because...no me gusta raw onions) with tomatoes and a very flavorful tzatziki.  The pita bread was perfect and didn't fall apart as it has at other establishments.    Very worth the money and very close by!  I'll be frequenting this and now I have more to choose from on 99th and McDowell on my way home!

Saying goodbye to a friend who is moving across the country is never easy.  But...when you surround yourself with friends, drinks, food, and laughs...it lessens the heartache.  This place has a GREAT happy hour and the server did an amazing job accommodating our large and crazy party with separate checks and all!  Beer is cold, shots are chilled, and the food is yummy!

Being away from family on Easter isn't always easy.  Missing the home cooked goodness and the niece and nephews hunting eggs.  So I was thankful for my two sistas from other mistas for joining me for brunch.  This place is super cute and absolutely delish! I ordered the Mexican Benedict.  Sopes instead of bread...chorizo, cilantro and a lovely poached egg with hollandaise sauce! Served with their spuds...I added their arugula salad and dropped that on top of the benedict...perfection!    This place is great! I know we will be back and I'll definitely have the banana bread pudding french toast my friend got...that ish was off the chain!

So let me preface this review by saying that any place that has tequila on tap that is chilled to 5 degrees is a winner in my book!!!  HUGE selection of tequilas...and this one item on the menu that will leave you wanting more.  Queso! White Queso..with chips and chorizo.  I died.  A thousand deaths.    The food was tasty and the tequila was icy! Nothing could be better!!!

Random adventures often lead to finding the diamond in the rough.    Went for a late lunch with a friend I hadn't seen for over a year just to catch up.  We initially planned on going to the cafe next door, but because I had just gotten off of a plane after a 2 hour delay...they had already closed.  We wandered next door and walked in only to be greeted with smiles and welcomes!   The woman behind the counter explained everything on the menu.  Everything in this place is freshly made.  Hamburger meat is hand pressed and never frozen...sandwich meat is Boar's Head and is freshly sliced to order.  All burgers and sandwiches are served with homemade chips (LOVE THEM!).    I ordered a stuffed burger (hey! Don't judge me!  I was in an airport in Idaho Falls for nearly 5 hours and only had water and cheetos all day!)  Anywhooooo...I ordered "The Pit" which is stuffed with FRESH jalapeño slices and topped with pepper jack cheese.  OMG DELISH!!!  This thing was so huge that I brought more than half of it home!     I can't emphasize enough how friendly and welcoming this place is! Don't let the name scare you away!  Unfortunately, I live so far away...however, next time I'm on this side of town, I will be back!  Ok...I'm not done...this place had me at Ginger Ale on the FOUNTAIN! YES...GINGER ALE ON THE FOUNTAIN! Do you know what that means?  Endless icy goodness!  Okay...I'm done now.  No wait....GINGER ALE!!!!  (I had 4 refills....)

The BFF and I were on our way to go eat some chinese food when we remembered "that new pizza place" that was opening up down the street.  We went by to see if it had opened yet and it was.    We were greeted warmly by the staff and perused the menu.  It's very basic.  Either a 12 inch or a 16 inch pie with your choice of FRESH toppings.  We decided to get our favorites: fresh basil, roma tomatoes, and fresh garlic.  WOW! The crust is thin and crispy, the toppings were robust with flavor and the only other thing I can say is HELL YEAH! Yummy pizza!    I had heard about this place from a co-worker who is from Michigan (the place where Mr. Scribs started out) and I'm glad I listened to her!    The only suggestion I have...ICED TEA!  :-)    I really hope this place lasts because good pizza is hard to find in the West Valley!  Plus...they also offer a 100% guarantee.  No really, they do...if you are not happy with your pizza, they pretty much give you your money back!  We definitely didn't have to go in on that!

I can't say enough good stuff about this pizza!    Thin crust that is beyond perfection.   Freshest of ingredients that add the perfect amount of robust flavor!  Prices are amazing and the staff is still as friendly as ever!    This time we ordered basil, tomato, and garlic.  Good, gooder, and goodest! (I'm a teacher...I know these aren't real words...but hey, It's a review and it's MY review! hehe)  The sauce is very savory and there is always that 'just right" amount on your pizza pie!    Thanks for having us again and even though we showed up before closing...thanks for still having a smile on your face and perfection on the plate!

Love this place!  Like the one in Tempe, they also have the newer Coke machines which I LOVE! I was excited to see it since I was able to try it out when I was in Atlanta a couple of years ago, even before they were in any stores or restaurants.  It took me back to being in junior high making a drink with everything on the fountain.    My burger was just as ordered and my fries were fresh and crunchy.    They were friendly and the food came out very fast.

I came ready to air my grievances and once I was there I forgot I had any!   So many doo-dads, crafty creations, sweet temptations and FOOD TRUCKS!!  From t-shirts and poster with facetious sayings like "I'm a baby duck.  You, YOU, are nothing!" and "When I look in the mirror I see a unicorn.  A bad ass unicorn."..to shirts made of hemp and necklaces with photos hanging on a sari necklace! Then sweet treats like whoopie pies packaged in gorgeous bows and ties what could very easily be found at Tiffany and Co!  Why not buy yourself a gift and unwrap a tamale?  Doctor Hummus is there too...don't pass him by!   Live music and picture booths and lavosh and cookies and pies and paletas and...I could go on for days!    The bff and I had a great time and all the other fun loving people there were just that.  We struck up conversations at every booth and left smiling!    This is a Phoestivus for the rest of us!

Ok.  This is going to be short and sweet.  Like me.  This was absolutely the best Burger I have had...ever.   Actually burgers...let me explain before you judge me! ;-)  My friend ordered the Euro and I ordered the Hell's Kitchen...then we split them.  To me, that is the best thing to do at a place you've never been before.    Burgers were cooked to perfection and the toppings did NOT overpower the flavor of the high quality beef they use.  Holy crap.  AMAZEBALLS!  Awesome drink selection as well.  Thanks Gordon!

Love the loud music...honestly. No sarcasm here!  My order was spot on and kept me going.  So thankful that this place is on the way to my hair stylist.    The "baristas" were friendly and gave suggestions that I gladly followed!  Can't wait for my next stop.  Coffee is my drug!

Not your typical auto shop!  I called earlier in the day to get an estimate on brakes and possibly rotors.  I had gone elsewhere the week before (and won't be back at that place) for some other repairs.  As a Yelper, I took to the search and found this place.    The phone was answered by a friendly female voice, which instantly caught me off guard...again, not your typical auto shop.  She was very honest and understanding of my situation.  She gave me a rough estimate and told me to come in later in the day to get it checked out.    I did and of course, karma being karma, my worst fears were realized...the rotors were shot!  I knew it would be a bit more pricy.  I'm a teacher.  That should give you a small inkling of the anxiety I was facing.    Phil was straight up honest with what was going on with my car and I gave the go ahead to get it done. I didn't feel like I was being talked down to as a female at all.  Again...not your typical auto shop!     I arrived at around 3:30 and they were able to finish the job that day before closing.  The waiting area is clean and welcoming.  I like the fact that the auto bay is not all up in yo' grill while you are waiting.  There isn't even that "smell" that you normally smell.  I know, it's silly, but it's something I noticed.  ;-)  I have a feeling this will be where I take my car from now on.  Thank you to Phil and his staff for taking care of this weary teacher and her car!

I will start off by saying that I was very hesitant to try this place.  The thai place that was housed here before this was very near and dear to my heart.  It was where a close knit group of friends and I often met to break bread and enjoy one another's company.  But I caved and gave it a chance...I'm glad I did!  I am a sucker for Pad Woon-Sen.  So of course, this is what I ordered.  I was excited when she asked me how spicy I wanted it and I quickly answered, "VERY!"  I got what I ordered!  A steaming plate of glass noodles mixed with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, and other veggies.  It also comes with a side of rice.  The thing about this was that the level of spiciness is apparent throughout the entire dish.  It's not just an afterthought...it's cooked in so with each bite, you get that delicious flavor and a slow building heat...that I love!    We also ordered a side of spring rolls that came with a clear and more "brothy" version of sweet and sour sauce.  It was not too sweet or too sour...it had a very yummy tang.  The spring rolls were very flavorful and crispy.    I am really hoping that this place can last.  We need good Thai places out here in Maryvale.  I'm sure to be back and try some other dishes that will take me out of my comfort zone!

Scene: A cold, rainy night in the west valley.  Darkness has set in.  Two girls searching for something to warm them up.    Setting: A busy strip mall with a very tiny Vietnamese restaurant.  Few tables.  Friendly service.    Pho.  So pho-king ready for it too!    Delicious!!!!  HUGE servings.  Plenty of veggies and meat.    Conclusion:  Thankful to have tasty pho and banh mi so close by!

Who would've thunk it?  A seriously delicious Vietnamese restaurant in Maryvale?!?    Well, it happened.  I work down the street and this is on my way home, I had been telling my bff that I wanted to try this place for quite a while.  I had worked in my classroom late on night last week and I wasn't in the mood to cook...so I stopped to get an order of pho to go...I am so glad I made the choice.  Savory broth, raw beef, fatty brisket.  An abundance of noodles and veggies and a slice of lime.  Hoisin and sriracha.  Spring rolls.  Just do yourself a favor and order them.    Well, a week later and the bff and I were out and about on a rainy night.  What is better than a big bowl of pho on a rainy night?  Again, perfection.  Friendly and fast service is just the icing on the cake!  One word of warning...they're closed on Wednesdays!

I've seen quite a few people post about terrible service and bad food.  I had the opposite experience!  We went with a few coworkers to celebrate the beginning of fall break!  We had a 1/2 day of school and found out that happy hour started at 11am!  With $2 drafts and well drinks and cheap appetizers, how could anyone go wrong?  We had a great server who took care of our large party, separate checks and all!  The food was tasty, the drinks were cheap, and the fun was fun!  I ordered the fried bologna sandwich and was not upset about that! Totally reminded me of the ones my grandma would make when we were kids!  Will definitely go back for HH again soon!

So...We came back.  This time, it was after a spring training game and I had my sister, her husband, and their 3 kids with me.    Service was fine...place was actually pretty busy for a weekday.  My nephew and I enjoyed our meals...I had the fried bologna sandwich and he had the buffalo chicken sandwich.  However, my sister and her husband couldn't even eat theirs.  They ordered these MONSTER nachos.  I'm not kidding.  These things could feed 10 people.  So the other two kids ate off of them as well...or at least tried to.  I mean....who doesn't like nachos?  These nachos are served with 3 types of meat. Smoked chicken, bbq brisket and pulled pork.  Now the chicken was good...it was just a basic smoked chicken...no sauce.  But the pork and the brisket had sauce.  The absolute most sickeningly sweet sauce known to man.  So sweet, that it could have been called a dessert.  Needless to say, the nachos were not very edible.    Thankfully, the server was kind enough to take the nachos off the bill...but from now on, I know not to order anything of the bbq sort here. I'll stick to the appetizers, bologna sandwich, and beer.

Absolutely dig this place!  The atmosphere is awesome...it's like you're in a birdcage or something.    Had several small tastes of their local brews and I was surprisingly pleased.    The food was delish and our server was more than willing to help us figure out what to try.    I had the green chile pizza and it was delectable.

Beer.  So many of the beers!   There is a slight possibility that I may have just found the mecca of cool.    A ton of different games to play while you are partaking in the plethora of hoppy happy treats. Random beers I've never heard of are available for the sipping.    I love how they have their chalkboard color coded so it's "easier" to make a decision.    Be warned, the place is quite small...and awesomely dark.  See you there!

What a fun night!  Myself and 3 friends went in for a girls night out.  We laughed the entire time.  The instructor was easy to follow and we came out of there with some pretty awesome works of art!  The owner is very friendly and the space she has created is open and welcoming.    I hope to go back again soon!

This location recently opened up and I had received a gift card from one of my students at the end of last year.  Finally got to use it!  I honestly did not feel as if I was in Maryvale! It is very nice and I hope it stays that way.  Hostess and servers were very friendly.  We were informed of the different menus and given plenty of time to make our choices.  The honey wheat bread is absolutely delicious! We ordered one of the "limited time only" appetizers...brussel sprouts au gratin! Aside from the onions (I would have asked for no onions had I known), it was very tasty!  I ordered my steak medium rare and it came out perfectly! My baked potato was baked to perfection...fluffy and not over buttered or sour creamed!  I also asked for a caesar salad...one suggestion, ask for the dressing on the side! It comes very LIGHTLY dressed and needs more!  The dressing does lack a little bit of flavor, but if you add some of their freshly cracked pepper, it helps.  So, there's only one "complaint".  We were seated at a booth. The two managers (at least I think they were the managers as they were wearing dress shirts instead of the uniform worn by the rest of the staff), were standing against a wall right near our table.  Both my friend and I kept commenting to one another about how awkward and uncomfortable it felt to have them both just standing there as if they were watching us or guarding us...or something. The spot they were standing in was directly in front of the entrance to the restaurant, but still, it was just weird. Mostly because they were standing RIGHT in front of our table basically! It wasn't too busy at all, as we went in on a Wednesday night.    Other than that, it was a tasty experience! We will be back but will ask not to be seated in a different location as to avoid having the "secret service" watching us and the door!

Absolutely in love with this place!   What a great happy hour!    I met a good friend there and we both had a spicy margarita...ok, we had more than one!  I had 3 tacos and cannot decide on my favorite...ok, the mole!  hahaha I'm really bad at making decisions!   Considering celebrating my birthday here next month...that's how much I loved it!

Great service and "reasonable" prices.  They can sometimes take a long time to get stuff done, but for the most part they are all super friendly and ALWAYS do a great job!

Well...the search is over.    After many miles and years of travel...the tastiest bbq in The Valley of the Sun...dare I say...the Southwest? Well, it's here.  I have to say, before I go on...do not plan on going after 1:00pm...you may not get to try it all!  This place is the epitome of Texas style BBQ.  The brisket is smoked to absolute perfection, the sausage is seasoned cooked to that just right "bite".  The jalapeno cheese grits...well, just eat them and expect to be craving them in the middle of the night!    They have pork, ribs, brisket, sausage, turkey, tater salad, BOTTLED COCA COLA...and...what makes it the cream of the crop...SMILES on their faces as they serve up all of this absolute goodness.    These guys really know what they are doing...no doubt!  The fact that nothing is sauced is what drew me in.  I prefer to sauce my own meat.  (I went there!) and the 3...yes only 3 sauces are ALL delicious! I COMMAND you to try the mustard based sauce...holy amazeballs!  Glorious!  We even got a mini tour of the 850 gallon smoker that they use and got a peek inside of the next day's offerings.    Let's be honest...I could go on for hours about how amazing this place is.  But I will let you decide for yourself...get back to me!    Oh...and if you go...tell Travis that Ella sent you.  However, even though my name is pronounced like Ella Fitzgerald's name...say it as in the spanish word "ella" (A-ya"  He'll get a kick out of it!) I think??

Always friendly and coffee is delish!!! Get a Bob Marley!!!  You can also try a butter beer if you feel, especially hot!!!   We came on opening day and it was nice to see that they had it organized and quick. Considering the long lines of cars and foot traffic. Cops directing lines too!!  So glad to see them on my side of town!!!

Ummm...beer, burgers, off the chain mac n' cheese? There is not a better way to celebrate my birthday!  Was a great time and we had an amazing server who gave us all suggestions and stellar service!  I had a burger that wasn't on the menu and it was the triple alarm burger with tons of fire! DELICIOUS.  I did a flight of all the MBB brews and was NOT disappointed in a single one! Go.  Drink.  Laugh!

Decided to hit this place up after some Cardinals training camp last weekend.  Glad we did!    The staff at this place are all super nice and make sure that you have what you need.  Though my friend and I didn't eat, they had a pretty decent selection of your typical bar foods and main entrees.    One big plus..$2.50 Coronas that were ice cold on a scorching day!    The bonus was the DJ showing up for a bit to play a musical Bingo game...he handed out cards with random tunes on them and you listened and played bingo!  I even won a game and have a $15 tab the next time I come in...woot woot!  The bar manager Cory was hilarious and gave great customer service.  Will definitely be coming back to The Nest!

Cannot say enough about this place!  I mean what an amazing concept!  Great prices and the ability to customize your pie!  They use fresh ingredients and the crust...oh the crust! I'm a thin crust person and this one is up there in quality and taste!   Hope it makes it...even though I miss the establishment that used to be in this location! ;-)

Yay! They're here! I loved this place on a visit to the east coast a couple of years ago.  I got the small Indonesian Peanut Saute and a small side salad and it was the perfect size for lunch!  Tasty, quick, affordable!

This review is solely for the event and not any of the vendors.   The organization of this event left much to be desired. Yelp Elites were invited to take part in a special voting for this event. We were informed we would receive express passes to bypass any lines so that we were able to taste and judge the samples.   Received a call a week or so ago to confirm my participation. I arrived on time only to wander around aimlessly searching for the check in booth. Finally found someone who knew what I was talking about. Checked in, only to be told to go wait at another location. Then waited there. And waited. And waited some more. There was no way for vendors to know that we were part of a this event. Many vendors were rude. Chose not to give out samples. Etc. They ran out of water, alcohol, samples...all before 1pm.   Now I know this is the first year in Glendale, but we all were given the impression that they had done this before. I have been to several events at this location and they've all gone off without a hitch. It's all about planning and this one needed more thought.

Always on the lookout for a cool fun place to get pretty.  I found it.  This is the cutest little studio. From the moment I called to make an appointment to the moment I walked out the door there was stellar customer service!   I'm extremely picky about who touches my brows...you know what they say, "eyebrows frame the face!" I made an appointment with Paige.  All I can say is that she's amazeballs.  She really takes her time to get to know what you want and is very...very thorough.  Every last little baby hair and stray gone.  The shape was done to perfection and I still can't stop staring at them.  I had a very painless and relaxing visit.  She is working with me to fix the "mess up" my last person had (which is why I was looking for a new place) and I can't wait to see what they look like when they're actually even! haha  So if you are looking for a full service waxing studio...look no further.  This place welcomes you with a smile and you can't wait to come back. They offer a full menu of services and even give you 50% off of your first visit!  Made driving across town totally worth it and I will do it again and again!
