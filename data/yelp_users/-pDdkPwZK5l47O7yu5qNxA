Dude this place totally sucks a bums nacho cheese nut sack!!! i went there one time Cause everyone was like this place is sooo good, they jack off on your food its great. that sounded good, but when i went there no jacking off on the food, wtf!! but seriously the sushi roll we ordered was the size of a chipotle burrito and tasted like an old obese man farted threw an onion in to a tuna fish can!! not only did the food have quality that only McDonald's can do but the service was terrible. our waitress pulled out a shotgun and stuck it in my mouth and told me to say hello to the devil for her! i couldn't believe it considering we were eye fucking each other across the room to the ghost theme song. she made me tip her, and not the tip i wanted to give her.... mm mm. oh sorry anyway, if u want white trash gas station quality sushi and service that would make you feel like your in the movie Saw than eat at Kyoto " Home of the Garbage Roll".... one other thing they serve there food on a garbage lid

The yard house, where to start on this pretentious place.... Oh i know i will start from the bartender. OK so me and a few friends went here for a few drinks and maybe to talk to some ladies or possibly trannys my friend Sean is all into that, and i say don't knock it till u try it, anyway we sat at the bar and waited for our list of beers, when all of a sudden a man/pedofile crept out of the shadows gliding towards us as if he was wearing heelies or he was a fucking vampire!! he was very creepy and was wearing a trench coat and and a strap on, this guy was fucking creepier than Willam Defoe and it the clown combined!! I am almost 90% sure this guys is on AmberAlert.com, so he crept up to us and was like what can i get u guys...perhaps a beer, appetizer, or maybe a sacrificial virgin!! lightning struck at that very moment as my friends and i screamed like we just saw a picture of Al Roker's vagina!! we tried to keep it cool because we didn't want to end up in a dog kennel in the back of this guys van. I ordered the greatness which was Great white coastal stout and Guinness, it was pretty good but for 8 bucks it wasn't that good. My friends ordered some fucking daiquiris or some fruity shit like that cause there a bunch of pussies. We were thinking about getting another drink and the bartender rose out of the ground as if he had an elevator shoot him out of the darkest depths of hell!! I asked him what type of beer he liked and he said whatever makes an 8 year old girl pass out the fastest, i looked over at my friend and said they serve colt 45?? I ordered a Black and tan cause fuck it you cant go wrong with that...WRONG, my beer was completely flat and warm, so i asked the candy man for a new drink. he told me the beer was suppose to be flat so that way u can drink it faster, right than i knew....i had been roofied!! he winked at me and started to laugh so sadistically that the walls were crumbling and people were fleeing the bar like it was 9/11!! he pulled out a 2 foot machete and licked the blade and said....Can i get u guys any appetizers?? I said i think were just gonna get a booth, he replied ahhhh the bar is way better, u can see all the kids eating with there parents from this view, and its easy to slip roofies in the beer from here. I shook off the worlds scariest comment, and me and my friends grabbed a table. we looked at the menu for appetizers and i was gonna pass on the food, looked a little over priced. My friend ordered the coconut shrimp and my other friend ordered the spicy Asian glazed wings. When the food arrived my friend got 3 little shrimp over a pile of vegan diarrhea, for about 14 bucks. My friends wings looked pretty good, i tried one and they were alright nothing special, like my beautiful baby Tender Greens! We stuck around and tormented our waitress like the bartender taught us, we got the bill it was pretty fucking expensive for a round of drinks and 2 appetizers, but whatever my friends r rich assholes so they paid....i mean rich sweethearts ; ) as we were leaving the bartender flipped down ward from the ceiling like a vampire and said hope u guys have a .....lucky night!! we said, trembling with fear, alright cya.....he replied oh...you will.....you will and let out the loudest creepiest laugh like at the end of predator. the next day my friends went missing and the only evidence that was left of them was a comped receipt from a bartender ...who never existed!

Temple Bar! I have had many late night adventures here, some good, some bad, but i can tell u the bartenders r cool as fuck!! and fuck is pretty cool.lol Pete, Jason, and Ashley r all very nice and hook up the drinks perfectly! the only reason y i give it 4 stars is because when there's no happy hour everything is too pricey and i have also gotten in a lot of trouble after leaving this place. I will say though i have been 86'd out of this place about 9 times and they always welcome me back with funny stories reminding me of how much of a dumb ass this Lil schmuck can be! The UFC fights r always free, which is very hard to find in Scottsdale. The place is never consistent with customers, one day it will look like a fucking Raging club the next night it will look like, the outside of chuckee cheese( 6 pedophiles hiding in the shadows). I do like that they have bags there or poop chute or butt darts and beef swords or whatever u call throwing a bean bag, its a good game to play with a few drinks, reason i say few is because last time i had too many and played, i threw a fucking bean bag at someones table and spilled all there drinks(DUMBASS) all and all it is a pretty chill place to go when they have happy hour but don't expect too much, unless you live by the place

wow! Came here on my 21st Birthday. the bartender gave me a free birthday drink which he called around the world, it had every type of Smirnoff flavored vodka and the other half was hundred proof Smirnoff, the shot glass looked like Andre the giants coffee mug!!! Don't remember anything after that, but i got 86'd for passing out on the pool table....Just a reminder, Just say no to drinks that smell like butane!
