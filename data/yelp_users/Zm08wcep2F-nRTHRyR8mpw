Recently had outpatient surgery here (septoplasty & turbinate reduction - sinus work), and the whole experience was top-notch. Always felt well taken care of and in the hands of professionals. Everyone was very friendly, explained everything well, efficient, empathetic, etc. Wouldn't hesitate to return.

"World's friendliest"?  Uh, ok, if you say so!  Good parking options, Skytrain out of the east economy garages is now a really nice upgrade, free WiFi (be sure to use a VPN on an open network like this), good food options, decent traffic flow.  Decent bar selection and quantity too.  Clean, modern, well-run.  Makes a good first impression on out-of-town visitors.  Two thumbs up for Sky Harbor.

I first heard of Stockyards back in the late '90s when I was living in OC.  A co-worker kept raving about it, reminding me over and over to be SURE to hit "Cattleman's" for a steak if/when I'm in Phoenix.  Whoops, he had the name wrong, for like 2 years.  I was out here on business at one point and tried to find it.  Not surprisingly, the wrong name made it, uh, impossible to locate.  Fast forward a couple more years, and suddenly I'm a Valley resident.  Somewhere along the line, I'd figured out that the target joint was actually Stockyards, not "Cattleman's".  I've had dinner here a handful of times since, and have always enjoyed it immensely.  The beef here is to die for.  Probably the best steak you can find anywhere in the Phoenix area.  Lots of other choices on the menu, but you're really missing out if you don't order steak here.  Lots of side order choices, all of which I've tried I've loved.  Beware the "calf fries", they are actually a certain body part that you might not want to eat.  Let's just say that Beavis and Butthead would be amused by the fact that they're on the menu.  The light rail construction along Washington dealt a severe blow to business, and now that it's done, the economy apparently isn't helping either.  All of my recent visits have found the joint sadly semi-empty.  The location is odd.  They could use some sort of marketing boost via the local hotels.  Nobody I've dined with here has ever been the least bit disappointed with either the food or the experience.  Stockyards rates a solid 4.25 stars on the Brak-o-Meter.  It's quite expensive, and that keeps me from giving it the coveted 5-star endorsement, as the value factor is just "ok".  But if the stiff tab doesn't deter you, I can virtually assure you that you will find your steak to be top shelf, comparable to any snobby steak joint in the land.  Without the snobbiness.

"The flag is up!"  Who doesn't like to spend an afternoon at the local thoroughbred track, sucking down a few cocktails, wagering on the ponies, and rubbing elbows with every possible faction of society, from the homeless to the 1%'ers?  Turf Paradise is over 50 years old, and shows it in a lot of ways, but that's part of the charm too.  Plenty of free parking, dirt-cheap admission, and features alcohol and gambling, 2 of the most important ingredients to having a good time, in Brak's view at least.  Spend the extra couple of bucks and upgrade to the club house, which features a nice bar with friendly and attentive barkeeps, generous cocktails at reasonable prices, and lots of TVs so that you can bet at tracks all over the place and lose money that much faster (or hopefully win that much faster).  Give it a go, I don't know anyone who hasn't enjoyed an afternoon at the races when trying it for the first time, and they usually come back for more.

My 3rd review of a Guy Fiero-visited joint.. 2 here in Phoenix metro and one in Flagstaff.  This is TRULY a little strip mall dive.  Walk up and order, industrial-strength seating (i.e. hard/indestructible), etc.  None of that is a bad thing at all.. just trying to be sure everyone's expectations are set properly.  I wasn't sure if this was a sit-down joint or not, based on all I'd seen/read.  Now I know.  Frankly, I prefer it this way.  The tacos looked mighty good and I HAD to try them.  But I was also lured by the cheese crisp, with carne asada.  $6 for a combo with no steak, only $6.75 with.  Holy cow, there was a TON of steak in this thing, and it was humangous!  But it wasn't what I'd call a cheese crisp, it was really a quesadilla, at least by all of my past Mexican food experiences.  Nonetheless, it was pretty tasty, and a BIG meal by the time you threw in the beans & rice (which were very average).  I also got a chicken taco, on corn tortillas.  The tortillas are tiny, but they load the thing up with a lot of meat and fixins, so at $1.15 (!), they're an awesome deal, and VERY tasty.  On the Brak-o-meter, the taco rates a solid 5 stars, the cheese crisp a good 3.5 stars, and value rates 5.. for a composite average of 4 or thereabouts.  I wouldn't necessarly advise you to drive way across town for this place, but if you're anywhere in the immediate area or passing through, it's definitely worth a bite.

Excellent service as per usual standard for Discount Tire. In & out within stated 45 minute window for 2 new front tires. Competitive pricing, wheels properly hand-torqued when reinstalled. Rarely a hiccup at any Discount Tire location.

I love Charleston's.  For a chain operation, it's about as good as it gets, and that rates the coveted 5-star rating on the Brak-o-meter®.  The menu is relatively short.  I appreciate and respect this, as it means that the restaurant can concentrate on a relative few items, and simplifies managing their food inventory.  I've never had anything I didn't like, with particular favorites being the pork chops, ribs, chicken tenders (prepared from fresh chicken and served in a very generous portion), and various salads.  The decor and atmosphere is great, with a very darkened interior, yet just-right lighting over the tables/booths.  The service is consistently friendly and prompt.  Pricing is very fair for the quality of the food, and the portions are large.  On our last visit, I tried a new meat loaf dish that had just been added to the menu.  It was good, though probably not something I'd order again as there are other things I like even better.  I was asked how I liked it, and said it was "ok", and immediately got a visit from a concerned manager, who offered to swap it for something else on the menu.  I had to clarify that "ok" in this case meant that it was good, just not something I'd opt for again.  His concern was genuine and he was genuinely nice about it, not being the least bit condescending.  I really appreciated this.  Doesn't surprise me as it's consistent with the kind of attention and service we've always received here, and we've been many times.  Give Charleston's a try if you haven't already.. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Bob Arnold & Valley East Collision are awesome.  Andrea's unfortunate 2010 accident showed me the quality of his work.  Fast forward a couple of years, and my pristine and previously unmolested 7-year-old 330Ci was smacked in the rear, in similar fashion to her misadventure, by a young miscreant in a giant pickem-up truck.  I knew immediately where I was going for the repair, and Bob did not disappoint.  The work was done within the quoted timeframe, with all new OEM parts, impeccable paint work, and the same attention to the smallest details that I saw on Andrea's repair.  This is a 2-man shop, not some big conglomerate that's in bed with the seedier insurance companies.  Bob's a skilled craftsman, and he'll do you right.  Add another 5-star review to VEC's perfect Yelp record, it's well-deserved.  Tried to give 25 stars, but Yelp hasn't added that option yet for some reason.

LOVE Nello's. We've been here about a zillion times, not sure how I haven't reviewed it yet. Love the thin-crust pizza, and their salads are awesome. Consistently great service. Place is always packed and has a ton of regulars - a good sign of a good joint. I've also had the deep dish pizza and it's great too. Also have tried a few pasta dishes, and have never been disappointed. Can get pretty noisy on a busy Friday night, as the acoustics aren't great and if you mix in a few screaming rug rats, it can get loud. But I consider it part of the ambience of a family-type joint. Highly recommended!

I like Mimi's mainly for 2 things - their breakfasts, which are a good value and feature several items they do well that Brak likes - eggs benny, with nice thick ham slices, and good bacon.  Too many restaurants serve crummy bacon, and that can ruin an otherwise good breakfast.  I also really like the turkey dinner they serve, and occasionally the Asian chicken salad.  For a chain operation, it's pretty decent stuff, and the quality is very consistent, even across locations.  They fall short of 5 stars for inconsistent service.  Occasionally it's great, most of the time it's ok, and occasionally it's really bad.  But the food always meets expectations.

Old Chicago is about what you'd expect  from a chain serving by that name - a pretty basic menu, with a Chicago slant.  The food rates a solid 3 stars - not outstanding, but certainly not bad, and good enough for me to go back.  I threw in a 4th star because we've had consistently great service there.  We've had one waitress twice who is genuinely nice, clearly doesn't hate her job, and is on top of her game service-wise.  That stuff goes a LONG ways with Brak.  For a casual meal and perhaps a couple of belts, I rank Old Chicago comfortably ahead of such yawners as TGI Fridays (which has declined a TON in recent years IMHO) and others like Chilis and (gasp) Applebee's.  Give it a try, I think you'll like it.

Just had my colon scoped by Dr. Patel at SE Valley Gastroenterology.  This guy made the Phoenix Magazine "Top Doctors" list this year, and was the only gastro south of Scottsdale on the list.  The entire process was great.  Very friendly, professional staff, relatively easy prep the night before, and completely painless procedure with a good briefing at the end to me and the Zombie Girl.  Awesome doctor, awesome facility, great people all-around.  Brak's coveted 5-star recommendation!  Get your rotorooter job done today, especially if you're 50 or in a high-risk group.

Another strip mall gem.  The Zombie Girl and I hit Tokyo House after finding it reviewed here.  It completely lives up to the hype.  The owner is the coolest dude you'd ever want to serve you a meal.  He's got a ton of personality, is polite to a fault, and obviously loves what he does.  There is a large selection of stuff on the menu, all at ridiculously low prices.  I opted for a simple Teriyaki chicken bowl while the Zombie Girl dined on Yakisoba.  The food was fresh and awesome.  I also ordered a Mountain Dew, which the owner read back as "Dew from a mountain", awesome!  I returned for lunch the next day and had sweet & sour pork.  Again, everything fresh and flaming hot, obviously not pulled from under a heat lamp.  Went with a "dew from a mountain" again, of course.  Looking forward to trying more stuff.  Brak bestows Tokyo House with his coveted 5-star rating, with a supplemental 6th star for the smiling, friendly service.

Just seeing the name of this joint again makes my blood boil.  Several years ago, my cat had a tooth pulled here.  They sent him home the same day, and he was FAR from ready to be released.  He bled all over the house, was still sedated and disoriented and apparently in pain, and had a wrap on his arm and over his front paw from where they had an IV in him during surgery.  They said nothing about when to remove it, so I left it on for the evening.  When I took it off, it had been wrapped so tightly that his paw had swollen up to mammoth proportions.  Un-be-freakin-lievable.  Search the web for reviews elsewhere of this place, and you'll find other horror stories, especially about boarding nightmares.  Oh yeah - the guy who runs the joint is a scientologist.  He used to have a blurb on the website about it, but it has since been pulled down.  But if you Google his name, you'll find his personal scientology page, including ramblings about how it has improved his life.  SCARY!!!!!  Avoid at all costs.  I'd take my pets to a witch doctor before I'd return to this dump.

Hadn't been in a Whataburger in so many years I'd forgotten what it was like. Uh, now I remember. Dry, cooked-to-death patties on a hamburger bun that was oddly way larger than the meat, forgettable toppings, overall lack of flavor. Lots of good options out there for a fast-food burger - this isn't one of them.

Yelp does me right again.  I was jones'n for some new grub on a Saturday afternoon.  How about a new dog joint?  Yeah, that's the ticket.  Al's is nearby and the comments were positive, so off I went.  Sure enough, Al was sitting behind the register.  I ordered up a jumbo Chicago dog with everything, some O-rings, and a drink.  It was all fantastic.  GREAT toppings on the dog, good wiener & bun, and a generous portion of very good O-rings (served with ranch dressing).  Al came out and rapped for a few minutes.  I wind up spending less than $6 and left feeling fed, tough to do nowadays at that kind of price. Throw in Al's personable touch and it's a winner, big-time.  I let Al know how much I liked the grub and said that I'd be back.. and indeed I will.  Highly recommended.

Al's is no more.  He has apparently sold both locations.  This one is now something like "Taste of Chicago".  Had a Chicago dog there and it was OK, but the place has lost its charm.  Al, I hope you're doing OK and weren't a victim of the recession.

WOW!!!  Breakfast at Liberty was absolutely outstanding!  The Zombie Girl and I had an errand to run in downtown Gilbert this morning, so I suggested we try Liberty.  I'm a huge Joe's Farm Grill fan, and I've been to LM once before, long ago, but never for breakfast.  The joint was packed when we arrived and we almost headed to the joint next door, but grabbed a couple of open seats at the counter and were served immediately.  I had the basic breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, biscuit & potatoes.  Zombie Girl had some fancier scrambled affair.  Everything was heavenly.  Scrambled eggs rarely excite me, but these were just so.. perfect.  Fluffy, fresh, flavorful.  The bacon was great (and Brak loves bacon and is a huge bacon critic - this was definitely top-shelf stuff).  Pototaes were great.  And, the service was super-friendly, fast, informative, talkative, and really made us feel happy to be there.  LM is definitely getting into our regular weekend breakfast rotation.  Joe, you've done it again - you really know how to run a restaurant.  Please open something in downtown Chandler - it could really use your talents.

Dilly's features great, fresh sandwiches, salads and sides, served in generous portions, on a great variety of fresh breads.  The staff is always super-friendly and the joint is packed at lunch time, despite being in an otherwise almost completely dead strip mall that isn't doing anything to help draw in new blood.  Tip: go for the half sandwich and side or salad deal.  The "half" sandwich is much closer to a "full" sandwich, and it's a great value.  Part of the regular lunch rotation with the office gang.  Good stuff, Maynard!

I've been bringing my cats here for the last 5 years.  The entire staff is awesome.  There are 7 vets on staff and I have no single preference, because they've all been so awesome over the years.  I had 2 very old cats who were cared for through their final years here, and everything was handled with great compassion.  Brak's highest recommendation, a strong 5+ on the Brak-o-Meter.

Superb experience! Now that Carmine Mandia is performing here regularly, we just had to visit and catch his show again (an absolute must-see). We had an awesome dinner & cocktails, got to meet Carmine again for the first time in a couple of years, met the manager, and one of my pals from the bay area became a full-fledged member of the club, he was so impressed with the entire experience. This is old-school Vegas at its finest - the IAC has been here at the same location for over 50 years, and time has stood still - and that's a very good thing.

The A's get an "A" here because they have something no other local spring training team has - not one, but 2 ticket vending machines next to the box office lines. There are NO add-on fees for using it, the software is intuitive, and you can buy any available seat for any upcoming game. Just read that attendance is down 9% for the Cactus League so far this year, and I'm not the least bit surprised - ticket prices have skyrocketed the past few years, and I'm sure many fans are fed up. As Scott S. pointed out, $20 for a lawn seat is a major league gouge. Thank goodness Ticketmaster isn't involved, or there would be 3-4 fees tacked on that would kite the cost by another third. Thankfully none of that nonsense here.

Rosa's is awesome.  It flourishes despite its sketchy surroundings.  The location is downright scary from the outside - beaten-down old half-empty strip mall, with a clothing store next door that sells new clothing, but makes a typical thrift store look like Neiman-Marcus.  If you were just driving by, the odds you'd want to stop are near zero.  Don't be deterred!  Once inside, you'll be quite comfortable as the surroundings are nice and comfortable.  I've had several items here, but have settled lately into their fajitas.  I always order a chicken/beef combo, and I swear they simply double the portion of meat by giving full servings of each.  The beef is unusually good for fajita beef, very steak-like and tasty.  Zombie Girl generally goes for the shrimp tacos, which she loves.  Prices are reasonable, service is competent and friendly, and the value proposition is strong.  Rosa's earns a solid 4.5 stars on the patented, trademarked and copyrighted Brak-O-Meter, a half-star withheld for location.. but rounded up to 5 due to all the positives.  Visit Rosa's tonight, you won't be disappointed.  And you know you can always trust Brak!

"Maybe next time".  Brak must be prophetic.  On our next visit, we got to experience the famous "warmth" that Grandma is known for.  Let's put it this way - this joint can be about as warm as Hitler's bunker during a power failure in January.  There are too many excellent breakfast options in the area that deserve our business to have to put up with such foolishness.  Sayonara, Grandma.

GREAT pizza, and at a good price too.  They have a manhole-cover-sized 24-incher that's great for parties, and they sell $2 slices that come from this monster-sized pie, 1-2 slices enough for a nice, filling lunch.  The crust and sauce are great, everything is just right.  Great lunch specials too, and lots of good side items, like the best side salad I've seen in ages.  A solid 5-star recommendation.

Morales is THE MAN! Always in & out lickety-split. I bring my own exotic oil & filter, pay $20 for labor only. Well worth it to keep from having to crawl under the car in my driveway then have to dispose of the old oil properly. He's not a butcher like the "technicians" at that chain oil change place that I don't need to mention by name. Highly recommended!

My 2nd favorite local pie (Grimaldi's is #1 on the planet for me).  I love the thin crust pizza here, and their sausage is about the best I've ever had on a pizza.  The crust is just about perfect, the sauce is seasoned just right, the cheese is terrific.. great pie all around.  Slightly pricey but I never mind paying it because it's worth it.

Still love Rosati's.  They make a fine pie.  It would be a 5-star pie if the prices weren't out of whack.  But I keep going back because it's really tasty, and unique in flavor.  I HIGHLY recommend trying their sausage.  I generally don't opt for sausage on my pizza, but OMG, Rosati's sausage is tne best I've ever had on a pizza, and by a wide margin.  Another hint - they cut your pizza into squares.  This is kinda sucky because you have center pieces with no crust and that makes them a bit tricky to handle, plus the crust is good so everyone tends to gravitate to the outer pieces.  They'll pie cut it if you ask, do it, you'll be happier.

Love the QT.  Prices are always competitive (or better than competitive), the pumps always work and have legible displays, the air is "free" and virtually always operable (neither of which is common at many stations), the gas is ranked with the "top tier" brands for quality, and the convenience store always has anything you could possibly need from a convenience store, from a nasty hot dog that's been on rollers for 3 days, to a nice super-cold Red Bull & bag o' jerky for your road trip.

Recently had the exterior of my 15-yr old home (never previously repainted) done by Leach.  This is a family-run business that's been around a long time, and feels like it in dealing with them (and I mean that in the most complimentary way).  The whole experience was outstanding.  Prep was very thorough, and end result looks great.  Price was very reasonable, and the work completed within the specified timeframe.  I had to wait a few weeks due to business being brisk, but the wait was well worth it.  I also had Mike do an estimate for my interior, and will have them paint it as well eventually.

Great breakfasts, and not as crowded as some of the "trendy" spots nearby in Gilbert, which can have completely ridiculously long waits on the weekend. Started coming here for that reason, and really like it. They have probably the best hash browns I've ever had (you have to ask for them, country potatoes are the default breakfast side), and great omelets. Service is generally very good, though can be a bit of a hit and miss. Will continue to be a regular.

When Brak first arrived in the Valley of the Sun back in 2004, he fretted over having to find a new barber shop.  Back in SoCal I'd been going to the same shop for years and really liked everything about it.  I did some searching online, and came up with Floyd's.  It was nearby, and how could a joint named Floyd's Barber Shop not be awesome, I thought to myself?  Well, I really like Floyd's.  Great gang of barbers, 3 of whom have been there the entire time I've been going.  Good local chit-chat while getting the noggin buzzed.  The only thing missing is Opie wandering in for a trim.  Then again, ole Opie is balder than a cue ball nowadays, so I don't expect I'll bump into him anytime soon.  If you're looking for a good, old school barber shop, with friendly folk, very reasonable prices, and consistently good haircutting, no matter which chair you land in, then look no further, Floyd's is your joint.

One of my favorite local breakfast joints. Gets crazy-crowded on weekends, so it's usually a weekday-only stop for me. Killer omelets and outstanding fluffy, never greasy, hash browns.  Fast, friendly service. I've been to many similar little cafes in local airports, and it seems they're always good. Hangar Cafe is no exception, give it a shot - you'll be glad you did.

I've had Dave's bookmarked for a while and finally had a chance to check it out today.  FIrst of all, it's no longer on University, it's on Forest, south of its former location, within the hallowed halls of the ASU campus.  Keep walking past where the road ends, and it will be on your left.  Easy to miss unless you're looking for it.  I opted for a #5, which is a Boston dog, a chili dog, fries, and a drink.  Probably not the healthiest meal i've had of late. I really liked the unique "bun", and the Boston dog was probably my favorite of the two.  Good wiener, good condiments.  The chili dog was very good, if not outstanding.  The fries were just average.  Overall I really liked the joint and will almost surely be back, though when in the area it's awfully hard to avoid The Chuck Box.  4 solid stars on the Brak-o-Meter.

THE place in the ASU area to get a badass char-grilled burger.  Brak recommends you go for the Big Juan with cheese, and a side of o-rings.  The o-rings are outstanding, beer battered and fresh.  Yes, the place is old, dumpy, clearly a MAJOR fire hazard, brutal parking at busy times, etc... but once you bite into that burger, you won't give a flying farkle.  Pure burger bliss.

Seeing jobing.com more often lately with Coyotes Fever becoming a terminal disease.  It's a nice venue for hockey, with half-decent free parking and decent access, though the traffic flow is better for Cardinals games than it is for a packed hockey game.  The luxury suites are nice, and there's really not a bad seat in the joint, though the nosebleeds are predictibly too far from the action.  If the 'Yotes wind up staying in town, we'll probably buy a mini ticket package next year.  C'mon City of Glendale, don't screw this up - get a lease deal done and let's keep the team in Arizona!

We love Piero's.  My Vegas gang, intact since the mid-80s, tries to make Piero's a stop each time we're in town.  We've settled into arriving early and eating in the bar, which is a great experience.  Lots of regulars, including some old timers who have been in town forever, and make for some great conversations about "how things were".  The food is always outstanding (particularly the Osso Bucco), the service at the bar is friendly and fast, and the last 2 times we've been there, the same Sinatra-esque lounge lizard has performed, making for the perfect atmosphere for throwing back a few belts before heading out to the casinos for a weekend of Vegas delights.    If you like an old-school type of joint, off the strip and largely devoid of tourists, Piero's is a must-visit.

I like Chase, though with the roof closed, it has a bit of a warehouse feel to me.  But with the roof open, and the clever way the outfield walls swing open, it really feels close to a conventional outdoor stadium, and that's a good thing.  Free wireless now, which I think is a recent thing, and it actually seems to work (unlike Jiffy Pop stadium in Glendale, where you're lucky to lock onto a signal for more than 30 seconds).  Decent grub selection (far better than Jiffy Pop, which is horrendous IMHO).  Take the train and avoid the parking cost and hassles.  Go DBacks!  (unless the Giants are in town!).

Good lunch deals, reasonable prices. The St Louis ribs are my fave by far. Many side order options, and they're all good in my experience. Not a big fan of the brisket here, which is surprising as I'd expect better. The hot links, one of the lunch options, are outstanding.

What can I say?  I love Grimaldi's, and this is my 2nd favorite location in metro Phx, just behind the Chandler location.  The coal-fired, ultra-high-heat cooking method produces a pizza that's great in ways that are hard to describe, you just have to experience it firsthand.  Believe the hype - especially when it's coming from Brak - this is the real deal.

Brak has been a Cardinals season ticket holder since Jiffy Pop Stadium (its real name, ignore that advertisement on the side) opened in '06.  Brak has been to MANY stadiums and arenas all over the country, and you know what?  JPS is truly one of the elite, a world-class venue if ever there was one.  I haven't been to Jerry Jones' new palace in Dallas yet, which is supposed to be the gold standard now, but it would automatically lose 2 stars for that ginormous, 60 yard long drive-in theatre screen hanging over the field.  What the hell was Jerry thinking???!!  I go to the game to watch the game, not be distracted by a monstrosity like that.  Parking here and traffic flow are a breeze.  We now manage to get in and out of the Blue lot super-quickly, thanks to strategic parking.  We can stay at the game until the final gun and still fly out of the lot with almost no wait.  And, amazingly, the Blue lot is still free.  Amazing.  The Brak-O-Meter actually registers 4.5 stars for JPS (errrr, UOP) stadium, with a half-star deducted for the crummy food, which didn't get ANY better when they canned the old caterer after last year.  But Brak generally rounds up, and the rest of the joint tips the scales in that direction.  One last note - Michael Bidwill, PLEASE open the roof on nice days late in the season.  It's a travesty to sit in there with it shut when it's 70-80 degrees outside.

Brak absolutely loves chicken fingers.  R&R is a nice joint.  As billed, classic R&R serenades you as you dine.  There are lots of posters and actual album covers making up the decor.  The place has gathered something like 13 straight "gold star" county health inspection reviews.  This is a GOOD thing and I'm glad the owner is proud of it.  Nice not to have to worry about what's going on behind the curtain.  Prices aren't cheap but they're very reasonable for what you get.  Fingers of course is the focus, as well as lots of available sauces.  This can't be a very healthy meal, but it's sure tasty.  The fingers don't taste like frozen chain restaurant fare, which they aren't.. and it makes a huge difference.  Texas Toast is a fine complement, and the fries are good too.  Brak gives R&R Fingers a solid 4-star rating.  The only reason it doesn't get a 5er is that Putsy's in Tempe, when it was still open, was even better.  Damn, this is making me hungry.. I think I'll motor on over to R&R right now for a nice crispy lunch.  Mmmm mmm.

Interesting hole in the wall in the ultimate hole in the wall little town. I had pizza and it was pretty decent, though the crust was a bit thicker than I'd prefer on a thin-crust pizza, but that's a minor quibble. My girl had an eggplant parmesan sandwich that looked terrific and she loved it. Old, low-rent surroundings, but good, friendly service, spotless restrooms, and good food. Would do it again.

Bo IS the man. He has done extensive work on both my Z4M Coupe and 330Ci, and consistently does excellent work at very fair prices. He's very accommodating with your schedule and won't blow smoke up your skirt. His office wall is peppered with a zillion BMW certifications and awards. It's a 2-man shop where they know the cars they work on, and know their customers. Bo earns Brak's coveted 25-star rating.

Outstanding! How did I miss this place all these years I've been in Chandler? I'm now a regular. Love the cheesesteaks, and the warm hospitality from the family owners. If you love cheesesteaks, and like to support local family-run businesses, then you must give Philly's Famous a try, you'll likely become a regular too. Brak's coveted 25-star rating.

Absolutely my favorite pizza on the planet, and I've had zillions.  It's not any one thing that stands out, it's everything: the just-right crispy, thin crust, cooked quickly at some insanely hot temperature in their brick oven, their sweet sauce, the fresh toppings, the layered-on (not grated) mozzarella (which is actually cooked UNDER the sauce, we've been told). I like to plop down at the bar and chow down right there, while sucking down a cocktail. Staff always friendly and prompt.  I've had better experiences here than in Scottsdale or the new location in Gilbert.. Scottsdale has too many tables jammed very close together, and something's just not quite the same with the pizza in both other places, though it's very close. Can't recommend this place highly enough, I could  eat there 3-4 times a week!

Can't believe I'm just now getting around to reviewing Joe's.  Lately I eat here more than I eat at home!  This is the quintessential non-chain eating experience.  Joe's grub isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for, and Brak would FAR rather pay more for good grub than suffer with a "bargain" meal.  Joe's delivers great value despite the high prices, because the food is that good.  I've had lots of things on the menu and loved all of it.  For some reason, I'd avoided the BBQ chicken pizza for a long time, probably because I've had others that weren't so hot.  Then I caught the clip on DD&D on Food Network (search for "Joe's Farm Grill" on youtube to see it), which featured the pie, and realized that if Joe was serving it to Guy Fieri, then it MUST be awesome.  Well, I'm here to tell you, it is freaking awesome!  Currently my favorite meal on the entire planet.  I'm getting a hankerin' for one right now, just writing about it.. despite the fact that I had one yesterday!  If you're anywhere in the area and haven't been to Joe's, do yourself a favor and get your ass over here, you will NOT be disappointed.  A solid 5+ stars on the Brak-o-meter.

This is going to be brutal.  Hide the children.  If you've been to Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Qdoba. That is, until you start eating. Complete and utter ripoff of the concept, except for the part that matters - the execution.  Where Chipotle succeeds, Qdoba fails miserably.  The ingredients are orders of magnitude shittier.  The burritos are just plain bad..  My burrito was loaded with rice and beans and very little meat - basically the opposite of what you'll get at the "other" place.  On top of that, the rice and beans were the suck.  And if you know Brak, you know that he LOVES his beans.  But not these.  About all they're good for is a massive bean fart shortly after ingesting this crap.  If you want to know the root cause of this debacle, check out who the parent company is - it's Jack In The Crack®.  Pretty much explains it all.  Avoid at all costs.  Receives Brak's dreaded zero-star review, rounded up to 1 because Yelp doesn't allow a zero.

Spicy Pickle is a semi-regular lunch stop for me.  It's close to the office, and until last week, I could snag covered parking.  No more, now all the formerly open spots are "reserved".  Drat.  I've only had one thing here, the "Classico Pizzetti", which is a complicated way of saying "pepperoni pizza".  It's very thin and very fresh, and suits my appetite just right.  The crust is great and there's something about the seasoning in the sauce that hits the spot for me.  Someday I'll get adventurous and order something else from the menu.

I LOVE the concept.  It's close by.  The owner is a nice guy.  But there's a huge problem here, as others have opined - the burgers are HORRIBLE.  The bun is disgusting (if you can't even get the bun right, that's pretty sad) and the fried burger patty is bland, fatty, greasy, and not the least bit appetizing.  The fries are OK, helped taste-wise by the fact they're cooked in lard.  But they're nothing to write home about.  Everything else is all about the gimmick.. beer, booze, broads, cigarettes.  The burgers are EXPENSIVE.  Sorry, but I just can't come back.  If the burgers were even half-decent, I think this place would be a huge success.  But they're not, and I'd bet that repeat business is not nearly what it could be.

For a chain operation, Chili's has been run pretty well for years.  I like their recent facelift - they didn't change their look so much as to render it unrecognizable from their original look, but it looks more modern and is well-executed.  The menu is vast and pretty much anyone can find something they like.  The service at this particular location has been excellent for our lunch crew, across a number of visits.  Not spectacular, but never disappoints.

First off, to that group of 30 who had such a bad experience and are now piling on the 1-star reviews: I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. You did your best to alert them to the size of your group and your needs, and they let you down. I get that. But piling on a ton of 1-star reviews, especially when most of you enjoyed your food, is over the top. IMHO there should be a single review for your entire group. But I digress.  I've been to this place 3-4 times now, and it has never disappointed.  The food has always been fresh and flavorful, and from what I'm told, it's truly authentic New Mexico-style.  The service has always been prompt and friendly. The only thing I don't care for is the noise - the place has a concrete floor and metal (low) ceiling, and it gets quite loud.. but not loud enough to subtract a star, the food and service makes up for it.  Give it a try, and unless you have a huge group that overwhelms, I'll bet you love it.

We've been bringing the hounds here for years. Wouldn't trust them with anybody else - Dog Days has a great facility, run by great people who love dogs and care about your dogs. They'll come home happy and tired, after spending time playing with the other dogs, frolicking in the wading pool out back, etc. Brak's highest endorsement, 25+ stars.

I like FD's a lot, and particularly this location.  We generally eat in a booth in the bar, which is a bit more peaceful and private than out in the restaurant area.  Service has always been attentive and friendly.  Love the ribs, and they have particularly good sides, other than the half-ear of corn, which tastes frozen, boiled, bland, and crummy.  And Brak LOVES his corn.  The cornbread redeems however, it's excellent.  They also have great cole slaw and potato salad.  FD's registers a solid 4.75 stars on the Brak-o-meter, 1/4 star deducted for the crappy corn.

Yet another Yelp revelation.  Thanks to all who glowingly reviewed this joint before me and convinced the Zombie Girl and I to check it out.  We're trying hard to support local, non-corporate type places like Queen's,  You should too.  Especially when it serves up awesomeness at great prices in funky-chic surroundings.  We showed up at about 7pm on a Wednesday, and the place was deserted.  There was a lot of friendly banter with the staff, who might have been the ownership family.  We ordered up a 16" pep, and were informed that an 18" crust was already ready to go, so that's what we were getting.  Cool!  The pie was awesome.  It's kinda generic looking, but in a good sort of way, like a pizza should look.  You know, not like some "gourmet" abomination served at some overpriced joint in North Scottsdale.  The crust was thin and fresh and delicious.  The sauce was sweet, fresh, and outstanding.  The cheese was slightly browned (Brak likes it that way) and tasted just right.  The pepperoni was.  Pepperoni.  Which means, it was great.  We'll definitely be back.  This is exactly the kind of place we like and want to support.  If you've read the other reviews and have been thinking about checking it out, quit screwing around and get your ass over there!  Queen's Bakery & Pizzeria earns Brak's coveted 5-star review, and is his "executive selection" for the month of June.  Whatever that means.

Culver's is an unusual place.  From the road, it looks like another Dennys or (gasp) Waffle House kind of joint.  For years I drove past frequently and assumed that's what was going on inside.  Not true, it's actually a more of a fast food joint, but with a massive menu containing more traditional items you'd sooner expect to find at Dennys, plus a ton of dessert items.  It has a large seating area, and is relatively clean.  Employees are friendly and efficient.  Those last several traits you won't find at your local Mickey D's.  They brag about their "Butter Burger" being the cat's meow.  Gotta disagree with Sam - it's NOT a better burger than In-N-Out, but it's still pretty decent and of course there's a ton more stuff on the menu than the mighty king of drive-thru burgers offers.  Tonight was my second visit, the first time having the aforementioned burger, which I liked plenty, then tonight I opted for a creation called the "Wisconsin Double", which sounds more like something on the menu at a seedy Oshkosh massage parlor than at a restaurant, but I digress.  Rather than a tag team of local masseuses of questionable character, it's actually a patty melt-type of thang, with 2 of the better-than-decent hamburger patties slid between slices of grilled rye bread, topped with swiss cheese and grilled onions.  No additional greasy stuff (mayo, thousand island artery cloggers, etc) added to muck up the formula. That sucker was pretty damn good, and not your run-of-the-mill fast food fare.  For a side (to complete a "basket", consisting of entree, side & medium drink) I opted for the cole slaw, which was just barely OK.  The greens were fresh and crispy, but something about the dressing just didn't do it for me.  Last time I was there I opted for the mashed potatoes (Brak LOVES mashed potatoes!) and they were great.. not sure wth I was thinking this time.  Lesson learned.  Didn't have a dessert tonight, but last time had some sort of lemon ice concoction, and it was great.  Lots of interesting desserts on the menu, including something called the "concrete mixer", which sounds frighteningly unhealthy, but is probably very tasty.  All in all, a solid 4-star experience, and receives Brak's coveted seal of approval.  Give Culver's a shot, I think you'll be glad you did.

I've been with State Farm for 30 years now, and with Scott's agency for the last decade or so. Always exceptional service, on the rare occasion I've needed it. State Farm has always been there for me, and Scott and his staff have always been great to work with. Don't fall for some lizard or caveman on TV trying to tell you "you could save 15% or more on car insurance!", fact is you probably won't, if you go with the lizard. Their rates are actually quite high, and State Farm will generally be lower. Who pays for all those commercials anyways? Hint: it's not the lizard.

1-star review because they forgot your fries? That stuff happens, what matters HERE is how the food was.  In-N-Out is a SoCal institution, STILL family-owned by the Snyder family for their entire history.. every location is company-owned, there are NO franchises and no "big corporation" behind the brand.  Simply put, this is THE best fast-food burger in the land, bar none, IMHO and of many, many others.  They use nothing but fresh ingredients - nothing is ever frozen - and their employees are the best in the industry, no doubt the fact that they're the best-paid in the industry has something to do with that.  If you've never had one - drop by for a Double-Double and experience true burger bliss.

Attended the massive Big Red Rage show for the Cards' final home game against the Seachickens. 3 of us had burgers and it was the best burger I've had in as long as I can remember. Minus one star for crappy fries. But the burger I'd do again for sure. Service was good, especially considering the mod scene in the joint that night. Will visit again soon.

Grabbed a couple of slices for lunch today after stumbling onto the glowing reviews here.  I concur - these guys make a good pie!  As others mentioned, the joint was almost empty at 12:30pm - NOT good.  If you're in the area, do check Casanova Bros out, I think you'll be glad you did and will become a regular.  If I lived closer, I would most definitely be back often.

I love this joint. The teriyaki chicken plate/bowl is superb. Prices are a tad high for a fast food-type format, but they deliver with HUGE portions of good food. They even have a teriyaki tap near the utensils for those of us who want to add a bit more.. cool. I've also tried & like the yakisoba noodles, and I've heard good reviews on the sushi items from friends. Good stuff, highly recommended.

NOT impressed. The food was bland, the chicken rubbery, the service was slow despite only one other customer in the joint, and all-in-all, it was a mall-food-like experience.  I won't be back, lots of other options within steps.

How can a joint that serves hot dogs and is loaded with football memorabilia not get 5 stars??  Brak is a hot dog & football fiend, so this one is a natural for me.  Not a huge menu but that's ok, I'd rather see a joint concentrate on what they do well, rather than try to offer pages and pages of different stuff.  I've had the smothered chili dog, and a BLT on sourdough a couple of times, and both are outstanding.  Willy's bacon is particularly noteworthy, in this day and age of crappy bacon being passed off as edible by far too many eating establishments.  This stuff is the real deal.  It's truly a family-run joint and Willy is a most gracious host.  Now part of our regular lunch rotation and we will definitely continue to be steady customers.

"The best kept secret in Gilbert" the sign says out front.  We stumbled into this place when eating at a nearby competitor recently and tried it out next time we were in the area.  We've now been twice, and it's been a great meal and experience both times.  OUTSTANDING omelet, great wheat toast (yes, there is such a thing as lousy toast, and this ain't it), good potatoes, and great, friendly service.  Comfortable seating, temperature just right, fair prices.  They've pretty much got it all nailed.  Weekend mornings don't seem too busy, which is a nice change from some of the popular joints were you have to wait - no waiting here so far and probably is never a problem from what I can tell.  Give this place a try, they're worthy of your business - and I'm confident you'll be glad you did.  RBC earns the highly-coveted 5-star rating on the Brak-o-Meter.

Dropped in for a burger today after noticing this joint recently and checking the previous reviews here.  I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that I really want a little local joint like this to be successful.  If the grub is good, I'll continue to support it and its kind.  I ordered a double-burger, hold the cheese (Brak is trying to drop a few pounds), and an order of fries (whoops!).  The burger was good if not outstanding.  The patties are fried, but not too greasy, and the meat tasted fresh.  The standard condiments are the universally cliché thousand island dressing, lettuce, tomato & onion.  The TI dressing was a bit weak, but the fixins were fresh and tasty.  The fries were very good.  A solid 3-star meal - pretty good, but nothing to distinguish it.  Brak adds a half star for the excellent fries, and a half star for local non-franchise ownership, pushing the overall rating to a 4 on the Brak-o-meter.  I fear that these guys might have trouble staying open.  A sign on the door stated that they were now closing at 5:30pm daily, and I was there around 12:45pm, and was the only customer in the joint.  Too bad, it's a worthy destination for a better-than-decent burger.  If you're a local or in the area, give it a try, I think you'll like it.  I'll be back.

This is a fairly new Jason's location, behind Chandler Mall.  Jason's features a huge menu, huge portions of quality meats, breads, cheeses, etc.  Great soups & salad bar too.  Free soft-serve ice cream (yogurt?) for dessert too.  The standard accessory with sandwiches is a handful of potato chips.. well worthwhile to upgrade to fresh fruit (and they always have VERY good fruit), or potato salad (also very good).  Food delivery can be a bit on the slow side, mysteriously even at off-hours.  But other than that, it's all good.. a solid 4+ stars on the Brak-o-meter.

As chain restaurants go, Carraba's is pretty dang good.  Good menu choices with some innovative choices, nice atmosphere, consistently good wait staff in my experience, and fair prices.  MUCH better than Olive Garden IMHO, in all respects.  When it comes to Italian, I prefer the mom & pop joints with red & white checked tablecloths, 50-yr old Olympia beer signs covered in dust, and Grandpa sitting over in the corner at "his" table all night, monitoring the goings-on.. but when one of those joints isn't available, Carraba's isn't a bad choice at all.

Yawn.  This is your basic Subway/Port-o-Subs clone, and that's not a very flattering comparison.  The sandwiches are grossly overpriced, lacking reasonable quantities of meat and cheese (while providing plenty of cheaper greenery to fluff the thing out, a la Subway), and completely run-of-the-mill.  If they would use more meat and charge less, then the place would be OK.  The ingredients themselves seem to be of fairly good quality.  But to overpay for a huge chunk of bread with not enough meat guarantees to keep me away from this joint.

Justin - I HAVE eaten here - several times.  I stand by my review that this joint is just a glorified Subway.  Perhaps the quality/freshness of the ingredients is *slightly* superior.  You still get very little meat and a ton of greenery for the money they charge, which screams SUBWAY.

Despite my prior hum-drum experiences here, I went back yesterday, as I was in the area and was in serious need of a sandwich - nothing else was gonna cut it.  The joint was busy - surely a good sign.  And my main previous gripe was addressed - they were putting quite adequate quantities of meat on all of the sandwiches I watched being made, mine included.  I had ham, pepperoni & provolone on a white roll.  The ham was excellent.  FAR better overall impression than my previous visits here.  Still expensive, but with more meat this time, not unreasonable.  I dare say I'm now a fan and will be back.. we'll see if this was a fluke or perhaps my past visits were.

Expectations were low based on the overall so-so review average, but I came away impressed. Had a large happy hour gathering from the office, and tried many appetizers, all of which were fresh and tasty. We had one waitress servicing a massive group and she absolutely nailed it, always there when you needed her, super-pleasant, and just on her game. Drinks were good too. Will give it a shot again for dinner.

Brak LOVES hot dogs.  Brak REALLY loves an authentic Chicago dog, and it doesn't get any more authentic than at Lobby's.  The burgers are damn fine too.  I'm getting hungry just writing about the joint.  It's small, mom & pop-sized, in a good way.  Nothing screams "chain!" or attitude or cheesiness here - it's just damn good grub, most of which is bad for you, which all the good stuff is, of course.  I think I'm going by for a Chicago dog as soon as I'm through at the salt mines today.  Yeah, that's the ticket!

This is a breakfast review only.  Haven't been for dinner yet, but after today's breakfast experience, we're definitely coming back for dinner.  Decided to take a break from our usual Sunday breakfast at Crackers & Co (another GREAT local choice for breakfast, but I digress) and give Il Vinaio a try.  It's quite near Zombie Girl's house and the breakfast menu was interesting, and surprisingly cheap for a joint that is obviously somewhat upscale at the dinner hour.  I had Eggs Benny, and it was the best I'd had in quite some time.  The hollandaise sauce, which can make or break a Benny breakfast, was outstanding.  The eggs were poached just right - firm with just a slight run to them, but not too wet or hard.  The potatoes were just OK, but that was fine because the main attraction was so perfect.  I also had a side of bacon (only $2.50 for 4 nice large thick slices), and it was outstanding as well.  Throw in friendly, attentive service, a nice atmosphere, and dirt-cheap pricing, and you have an outstanding breakfast experience.  We'll head back for dinner soon and I'll update my review then.  In the meantime, I highly recommend Il Vinaio for breakfast.. check it out!

Eating breakfast here regularly now, love it.  To all you haters who have NEVER EVEN BEEN HERE who are writing 1-star reviews, over the lion burger controversy - shame on you!  So you don't like the lion meat thing - I get that.  Have at it in the discussion topic here.  But if you haven't eaten here, DON'T POST A BOGUS REVIEW just for the sake of giving the joint 1 star and attempting to drag their average down.  That's BS, and you're a lousy Yelper if you're doing this.

Outstanding!  After finding nothing but stellar reviews here and at Kudzu, I hit up Eli for several small jobs - installing 3 new light fixtures, and a new kitchen faucet.  Set up for a 10am Saturday appointment (VERY convenient), service handled by his employee Rudy.  Rudy was on time, personable, knew what he was doing, and when he hit a slight snag when installing the faucet (my existing tubing was a different size than what the new faucet was rigged for), he ran to Home Depot, picked up the appropriate adapter, and carried on.  Cleaned up thoroughly when he was done, even hauled away the crappy old light fixtures.  Price was VERY reasonable.  A 10-star experience, and I will definitely use Eli again when the need for a handyman arises.  Thank you Eli & Rudy!

This chain has slid downhill gradually over the years.  Tried a Chicago dog, it was an insult to all true Chicago dogs - crappy produce, marginal wiener, overpriced for what it was.  They charge 50c to "upgrade" to a pretzel bun.  Nice bun, hideously overpriced upgrade.  You're far better off at a local non-chain hot dog joint than any Wienerschnitzel location, in Brak's experience.

Yeck.  A party of 5 from the office ventured here for lunch on somebody's whim.  Mistake.  It took them about 5 minutes to pull 2 tables together and seat us - and the place was 3/4 empty, even right at high noon.  You'd have thought we were a party of 20.  Then after we got seated, nobody waited on us for an eternity.  Finally a young waiter ventures by and asks if we've been helped yet.  It was clear we weren't "his" table but he went ahead and took our orders since we'd been neglected.  The food was slow to come out (again, despite the joint being mostly empty), and was ho-hum at best, worse than that to some in the group.  I had come sort of chicken finger concoction that was as forgettable as my last gas station burrito.  Don't bother.. sketchy service and forgettable food in a spot where there are tons of other better choices.

So glad I went with Bill and not someone doing the work in my own dusty garage. Bill has an excellent facility grafted right onto his house, once inside you'd never know you weren't inside a "real" business location. He's a consummate pro and it shows, in facility, chosen materials, and results. Got a fair, competitive price and a perfect tint job, while I waited and got some work done in his comfortable wifi-equipped waiting area. In and out in under 3 hours. I highly recommend Bill for your automotive or home/business tinting needs, and I'll definitely be a repeat customer next time I have the need.

Best lunch specials in the area, bar none. Incredibly reasonable prices, and if you don't want the special of the day, you can have any of the other day's choices for just $1 more. Includes unlimited salad (VERY good salad at that) and bread. Service is great, though the place does get packed. I particularly like the Chicken Parm and several of the sandwich options. Lots of good choices, and it's all good.

Yowza!  If you want a ton of good food for dirt cheap, head on over to Posidon for breakfast.  3 eggs, potatoes, and choice of toast or english muffin will set you back $3.75.  Add ham, bacon or sausage and it's just $4.25  The food is great, the service is super-friendly, and the prices absolutely can't be beat.  They even threw in some extra freebies.  This is the kind of local business that deserves your support, and you'll be rewarded with great food at great prices.  Spread the word and let's help them get off to a successful launch.  On the Brak-o-meter, Posidon earns the coveted 5-star, 2-thumbs-up, "Brak's highest endorsement" score.  That alone should cause you to jump into your Malibu and speed on over.

Latest joint on Brak's "AVOID" list.  I should have known - seeing the word "bland" about 3 times when skimming reviews should have been a huge red flag.  We had a fairly long wait on a Saturday evening before finally getting seated.  The service was slow and inattentive.  The food was overpriced.  I had fajitas, and it was WAY low on meat (chicken) compared to the other ingredients, despite the high price, and was bland as hell.  Your basic chain restaurant serves far better fajitas than this crud, for less.  Add in the wait time and glacial service, and this place was a huge disappointment.  You've been forewarned.

Good old fashioned hand job.  Reasonable prices, fairly consistently good results.  Could be a tad faster, but that's a minor gripe.  4.5 stars on the Brak-o-meter, and I will continue to be a regular customer.

Decent food, massive portions, and they have SPUMONI!!  That's a huge plus.  So why the 2-star review?  They made the "dirty dining" list for June, and that's NOT cool.  And after several visits, service was all over the map, from really good to crummy.   Sorry guys, you gotta try harder, and keep the joint CLEAN so that you don't score horrendously on your health department inspections.  Better options elsewhere.

Horrendous. One guy scrubs my wheels on one side of the car while the jackwagon working the other side chats up another employee, completely neglects his side. Then at the finish, the girl does a total slapdash job and touches NONE of the wheels. On the side that got neglected at the start they were embarrassingly filthy, can't believe she tried to pass it off as "ready!".  Sorry Danny, never again. Service was weak in previous visits, but this was off-the-charts lame.

I like this joint.  I didn't realize it was a chain until after my first visit - had more of a locally-owned feel to it.  The value is pretty good considering what other joints charge for similar fare.  The burgers are charbroiled and tasty, the onion rings are above-average, and the very reasonably priced side salad was far more and better than I expected for its price.  Close to work and will definitely make my regular lunch rotation.

Ugh. Crappy service, poorly prepared food. Ordered a cheeseburger. Instead received BBQ white cheddar burger, which was hideously oversauced with both BBQ and some sort of aioli. On top of that wet mess was a massive pile of onion strings. When the waiter finally circled back by to see how we were doing, I gestured to the pile of strings I'd shoveled off onto my plate and said "I'd hoped to avoid that", to which he replied that he'd submitted the order with "no onions" instructions, blaming the kitchen for the mistake. Huh? I didn't ask for "no onions", I just ordered something that didn't come with the strings. So he was lying. No offer to make it right. Receipt confirmed he'd just ordered the wrong burger, with no mention of no onions.  The burger patty was good, but lost in a sea of sauce. The bun was a soggy mess as a result. Big check for a crappy experience. Won't be back.

Had a dead mesquite tree that need to be removed and wanted to replace it with something else that would grow quickly, and be appropriate for the space. Geoff responded quickly to my request for a quote, provided a VERY fair price for the tree removal & stump grinding, suggested a Desert Museum Palo Verde as a replacement, which upon doing some research, decided was an ideal solution. The work was done quickly, and when the new tree was planted, Geoff's crew relocated my drip lines, inspected the whole system, and even relocated 2 in-ground lights under the tree, without additional cost. A great overall experience and result, will definitely recommend and use Agave again.

Saw CR II on Check Please, Arizona yesterday and liked what I saw, so we checked it out last night. They were out of horchata and flan, apparently a run on the latter due to being showcased on the show earlier in the day. I had combo fajitas (steak + chicken), while zombie girl had a fajitas choice that included fish, shrimp, and scallops. Both were excellent. Tried the Cheese Crispy appetizer, it was just OK - a bit on the greasy side. Chips and accompanying salsa both excellent. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food, service was great, the place is clean and clearly well-run. Will definitely be back.

This is the newest Culver's in the area, and now it's easy to get Culverized at lunchtime as this one is very close to the office.  Tons of unhealthy comfort food here, but if you order judiciously, you can actually eat pretty healthy here.  The desserts are excellent, the seating is cozy for a fast food joint, several giant TV screens on display, and free wifi.  Brak is a Culver's fan.

I knew better than to bring a small party to Buca di Gutbomb™, but was overruled and 3 of us had dinner here. With the massive "family style" portions these guys serve, 3 is just too small of a party, unless you order carefully (and I'm not sure that's actually possible). We ordered a pepperoni pizza, which was a giant lake of grease and just wasn't very good, a salad that would have fed 5-6 people and was marginal at best, and something else that was forgettable. Tab was huge, service was glacial, the entire experience lousy. Definitely won't be back.

Brak likes.  The sandwiches are very tasty, and the bread, their claim to fame, lives up to the bragging.  The meat & veggie quality seems to be high.  On the downside, the sizes offered are 6" and 12", with the 6" being a bit on the short side for me, and a 12-incher being WAY too big.  Would be nice if the "small" were a 7-incher, or maybe offer 6, 9 & 12?  Also, the sandwiches are a bit heavy on the non-meat items, a la Subway (hate to even use that word in this review), with the meat portions being rather thin, especially given the rather high prices.  I've also tried the cole slaw & yellow potato salad, and both were fresh and excellent, though again I thought the portions were rather small relative to the price.  All in all, I like the place and now visit regularly.  My minor gripes don't change the fact that they make a very tasty sandwich.

Believe the hype. This place is awesome. The slices they serve are utterly massive, it's hard to tell just how big they are in pictures, but trust me - one is a meal for almost anyone. The lunch specials are great - I had a 2-topping slice plus side salad & drink for $6.99. For that you get plenty o' pizza (very GOOD pizza, not just a lot of it), an excellent side salad made with a nice spring mix and extras like peppers, olives, tomatoes, and mozzarella. Counter peeps were super-nice, place was clean. Big Boys just made the lunch rotation, looking forward to going back.

I received a Presto Pizzaz Plus pizza cooker for Christmas, which finally gave me a good excuse to try Papa Murphy's. Pretty dang good pie! The Pizzaz cooker does a superb job cooking any pizza, fresh or frozen. I like PM's because it's not the least bit greasy, and the crust is excellent. Pricing is slightly high considering you have to bake it yourself, hence the 4-star review - a better value would have made it 5. Be on the lookout for coupons to cushion the blow to your wallet.

TOGO's is about as good as it gets for a "franchise" sandwich, and this location in particular is the best one I've ever been to. It's huge, well-run, with very friendly service, fast when busy, and consistent in quality & quantity. About a million times better than Subway, and a far better value as you actually get a reasonable amount of meat in your sandwich, unlike the other guys, where you get about a metric ton of lettuce and other fluff ingredients, hiding some wafer-thin slices of generic grocery case cold cuts. Give it a try if you've never been, you won't be disappointed.

Had septoplasty & turbinate reduction performed by Dr. Haegen. Outstanding overall experience, including the surgery itself, recuperation & followup. I can now breathe better than at any point in my life, and it's amazing! If you have breathing issues, I strongly recommend you visit ASC and get it checked out. It can change your life!

Like it!  Simple menu and fast service are a good start.  Meals all seem to be a pretty good value for what you receive.  The fingers were fresh & tasty, fries & slaw also very good.  Didn't have that "I ate a greasy fried lunch" feeling an hour later, like some fried stuff will do to you.. that's a huge plus.  Not quite to the high standard of the now-defunct Rock & Roll Fingers, but close.  A solid 4 stars, and will definitely be back.

This joint has the best lunch specials in the area. Many options, all incredibly cheap (i.e. 2 slices of pizza, a very good side salad, and a drink. for $6 tax included), and they are also very fast and efficient in moving the line, which can get quite long. Pizza is very good if not outstanding, salads are great. Now a regular destination in the rotation.

Love parking here, especially now that the SkyTrain is running. Reasonable price ($11/day in the garage), big parking spaces, quick jaunt to/from the terminals via the train.

Had breakfast here many times now, always good service, good food (though pricey - hardly surprising, it's Vegas). Never a bad experience, so we keep coming back. On our last visit, the waitress was one of the best I've EVER experienced anywhere - she was just stellar. We left her a fat tip, well deserved. Will definitely be back.

NOT impressed.  My order took forever because they basically lost it.  Won't go into the details, but it was poorly handled on several levels.  Not a good start.  They just opened, so I'd give them a pass, if the food had made up for it.  But, sadly, it fell short.  My 2 carne asada tacos?  Meh.  Poor value - very small tacos, generic store-like tiny tortillas, very thin, that probably should have been doubled up.  Small-to-moderate quantity of meat, which wasn't so lean and seemed of lower quality.  Nice seasoning helped, but meat was still lacking.  Lousy value - the tacos were something like $2.79 each, vs $1.29 for street tacos at Los Taquitos, which are FAR superior.  This was more of a snack than a meal.  Not bad, but not all that good, especially for the price.  Probably won't be back, too many better options in the area.

We discovered SJ's truck at the Cardinals game a few games back. OMG - we now show up early and head straight for the truck before every game, this stuff is truly AWESOME! And of course it's a better buy than the Papa John's tiny wheel of despair that they sell inside the stadium, not to mention 1000x better product. Makes arriving at the games early something to look forward to. SJ pizza and NFL Sunday Ticket on the Flight Deck - doesn't get any better than that. 1,000,000 stars!

Generic Ihop food, cheesy corporate surroundings, but bolstered by outstanding service that elevated a 2.5-star experience to 4 stars. On a previous visit here, the music was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think, but no such problem this time. Good overall experience for a "chain" breakfast.

OUT-STANDING!  This is 11" of awesomeness, your own custom pizza pie, created with excellent ingredients, cooked in record time (3.5 minutes they say, which is about what it took), served with a smile.  At $7.75 per pie, no matter how many toppings you add, it's a screaming bargain considering the overall quality of the ingredients and finished product.  I had a fairly basic Hawaiian job for my first taste, and it RULED.  I'll get a bit more adventurous moving forward - there are so many ingredients available, which you can add or mix to your stomach's desire.  The pie was just the right size to handle my very large appetite.  The beverage selection was great - the usual array of sodas, plus 4 different types of fresh-brewed iced tea, and even what appeared to be fresh lemonade.  This was only Day 3, and the owners were chatting up all the customers, wanting to make sure everyone was happy, and clearly know exactly what they're doing and how to be successful.  This is a great concept, executed perfectly.  Fired Pie immediately shoots to the top of the office lunch rotation.  Trust me, fellow Yelpers, this is the real deal.  Head over to Fired Pie at warp speed and give it a try - you won't regret it!

I've been a huge TOGO's fan for decades, so I'm a bit biased, but this location (and its sister location in Gilbert run by the same owners) are very good. The only downside of the new Chandler location is that it's tiny and cramped. The Gilbert location is huge. But both are well-run and are solidly in our regular lunch rotation. My personal faves are the pastrami and tuna (not together!). Orders of magnitude better than Subway, in both quality of product, and the generosity of ingredients (no BS poster showing 3x the actual meat you receive, as Subway somehow gets away with - criminal!).

Fantastic sandwiches, especially if you go with the legendary Dutch Crunch bread. They also have authentic SF sourdough which is very good. Sandwiches are huge, though quite pricey. Service can be a bit slow if there's anyone in line ahead of you. Be aware that all sandwiches are hot "unless otherwise noted". Found out the hard way when ordering a ham & swiss by phone that I wanted cold - wasn't asked which way I wanted it, so hot it was. Also had more stuff on it than I asked for. Still quite tasty though.

These knucklers get 5 stars for clever marketing, and 2 for the food. Sorry, just not impressed at all. SLIGHTLY better than that "other" huge chain that advertises sandwiches with 4x more meat than they actually give you (how do they get away with that??), but only slightly. Long, skinny sandwiches that cleverly hide the fact that they're not as big as they look. Marginal-quality meats. Overpriced for what you get. There are better options out there.

I've been here 3 times now, and will be back many more. This is the real deal - a true "deli", not some chain operation with crappy bread, supermarket cold cuts sliced paper thin, slapped together by some kid with an attitude. No, this is what I remember as a kid - a "real" sandwich, with excellent, fresh ingredients, served in fair portions, and tasting 1000x better than the chain stuff. I particularly like the hard baguette bread option, and most recently I tried the penne pasta with Bolognese sauce and meatball, and it was absolutely SUPERB! Lots of other options on the menu to explore too. Can't wait try more stuff.  I have one suggestion for the owners - please lose the fountain-dispensed iced tea, and brew your own. Costs less and tastes far better. Other than that minor detail, you're hitting it out of the park.

Outstanding! As good as the Portillo's I visited in Chicago a couple of years ago. HUGE HUGE joint, lots of parking, tons of seating (inside and out), fast service, awesome food. Super-impressed with the speed of service at the height of the lunch rush. Many lines open and all moving quickly, and food came up quickly. I had a bacon cheeseburger & o-rings and they were both excellent. Next time I need to have a Chicago dog - one of the finest foods on the planet.

Tried a thin crust pepperoni with the "free" sesame seed option. The price is suspiciously low ($7 for a 14" pie, plus $1.50 per topping), and now I know why. The crust was on par with a typical frozen supermarket pizza, the pepperoni didn't have much flavor, likewise for the cheese, which was kinda greasy. The sauce was just.. forgettable. Overall, I would have given it a "C" as a packaged frozen pizza. As a fresh pizzeria pizza, it should have done much better, even at the dirtball price. Verdict: 1 star for the pizza, plus charity star thrown in for cheerful staff.  Lots of people seem to like the place (I checked the other Gilbert location's reviews) so I gotta believe they're getting the standard crust and it's gotta be a better option.
