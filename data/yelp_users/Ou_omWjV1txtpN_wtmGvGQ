Beautiful costumes. This place has a huge variety of everything. The gal that was working gave me a 100% tour of the store. She was so sweet and I'm glad she walked me through the store. I will be back but now I can't decide what to be for Halloween!

Excellent service always at this location. Enjoyed a beautiful birthday dinner tonight with an amazing server. Great atmosphere. This is always by far my FAVORITE sushi place. EVER.

Warning: you should spend all day here. This place is the best for finding hidden treasures. I am obsessed with Disney and found so many amazing Disney items collectible and non collectible. Also had amazing help from the employees guiding me to items I was interested in (Disney items/ Xmas ornaments) thank goodness they could navigate the store because I would get lost! Will be visiting frequently because it's just amazing in here. Seriously, you need to wander through this place it's incredible.

Generally I'm always 100% satisfied with my take out orders but tonight it was awful.  I ordered a #14 and there was no side dressing with a minimum amount of dressing already on it. I also ordered a hummus appetizer which came with 1 pita bread. Dropped the ball tonight and disappointed.

Iron Chef has a great 50% all sushi rolls after 8pm. The rolls we ordered were amazing. We had: a Rainbow Roll, Golden Dragon and a Phoenix Roll. Because we had never eaten at Iron Chef before our waitress gave us complimentary sake.  Iron Chef is tiny so get there right at 8pm for the start of happy hour or you will have to wait to get a seat.  This place is definitely worth checking out and I will be going back every week.

Ive only been here twice and my first experience was decent. I recently went to Kens for a spa pedicure. The older woman who did the pedicure was really good until it was time for the hot towel. She did not cool or air the steaming hot towel and sat it directly on my legs! It was so hot it felt like she burnt me. She did not seem to notice or care. The other people working I saw had aired the towels out a little before applying it to the legs. I could not believe this lady. Will not go back. Total bummer.

I went to Youfit today to cancel my membership because my contract was up officially March 11th and I hardly went to the gym anyway.  I was told in order to cancel my membership today March 29th that there would be a $25 fee to cancel. It's free to cancel within 15 days of the expiration date of your membership. Ok so 18 days later I still have to pay $25 to cancel my membership. I asked to speak with a manager the kid advised no managers will be in until Monday. He said the managers will tell you the same thing I am now: you have to pay the $25 fee because you are 3 days over the 15 day window. He gave me a "Membership Consideration Request" to send to corporate. He said maybe they would call if I didn't get a response that means my request was thrown out. What?! Ok so seriously this place SUCKS! Small place with not a lot of options offered in NICER gyms.  If I could give zero stars I would! Wish me luck on my "Membership Consideration Request"

Went in here today for the first time and fell in love. Met the owner I believe who runs this business with her mom. Such a sweet lady! We bought 2 smoothies and they were amazing. Also purchased a hand made crystal necklace (quartz I believe) and it's amazing. Purchase a cute baby pink spiritual  Gangster shirt. Love this place and will be visiting again soon!
