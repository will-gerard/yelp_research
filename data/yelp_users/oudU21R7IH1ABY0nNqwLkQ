A great neighborhood bar! Food has always been consistently good. Big burgers, awesome nachos! Cold beer and karaoke on Thursdays. Great times.

I must say how things have changed. Karaoke on Thursdays, GONE! Lively atmosphere, GONE! Beer is still cold, that's good. This was our Thursday night hang out but I must say, not anymore :( oh and there were no specials. Hope they bring back the party on thursday night.

Superior Sandwich? OH YES!  Stopped in with my wife to check out the local place and I was caught off guard. I was expecting, well, I didnt know what to expect. First you grab a bag that's the type off sandwich you want. Then you fill in the dot for your topping selection. I kinda likes that. Turn in your bag and pay then a short wait later your food is ready. I got the 'grinder". Italian meats with what ever I wanted on it. I went pretty traditional with the toppings but added Hot Giardiniera! That made my sandwich "superior"!  The price was fair for the quality of food, and the staff were very friendly. I will be back!

I was always a #2 buzz cut guy untill I grew out my hair for a couple of years. When it came time for the Clippers to come out, my wife "suggested" I go and get it styled. My brother told me about this place and to ask for Adam.  Going to get my hair cut is foreign to me and I wasn't sure what type of style to get. Adam was way cool and I gave him free reign to cut and style my hair.  When he was done I could believe the transformation. What I got was a modern classic fair cut that actually looks like my grandfather's hair style from the 50's.  My wife looked at me and instantly became smitten with my new hair style.  Adam, you gave me the right cut man! I have sense taken my boys in to get cuts along with my $5 touchups. You can't go wrong here!

Carne asada is outstanding! Great flavor and quality. But you'll be cheating yourself if you don't get at least one Green Chile Cheese Tamale! So good! As to the reviews about service, I have been here 3 times and every time they have been very friendly. Food comes out hot and FRESH! Plus, while you wait you get free chips and salsa bar. What more could you ask for.

First, the menu sounds great. But the prices, OUCH! I ordered a turkey burger with a side salad cuz I'm on a diet but still want to enjoy my time out. The burger  was really good. So was the salad, but little did I know that they charged $2 extra for the side salad instead of fries or tots. Not cool! I also ordered the grilled wings (hey they're grilled) they are good but at $1 each? Come on! So my bill with a $4 beer was $31 and change! Never again.  I was there with a group of 12. I ordered early and received my food promptly. But others in my party took over 30 min and half were either wrong or burnt buns. Not OK. Again, never again.

After reading the reviews we were hesitant about trying this place out. But we figured we try. Boy are we all glad we did. We got there at 8:30 am on Sunday and we're seated immediately.  Our server brought water and offered coffee while we looked over the menue. Our order was taken and about 15 minutes later our food arrived. Everyone in our group got biscuits and graveyard and we all thoroughly enjoyed them. I thought the grave was very creamy with lots of flavor but wish it had bigger chunks of sausage. The biscuits were very good. Flakey and rich. The hash browns were crispy on the outside and not to soft on the inside with lots of buttery potato flavor.  The thick cut bacon was excellent  (nice that u get 3 pieces). We all said that we will be back.

Outstanding! I have been here three times and all three times have been outstanding. I love carne asada, and Senor Taco has some of the best. Super big burros and tacos that put other tiny street tacos costing about the same to shame! The Carne Asada Red Chile burro w/beans was one of the best burros I have ever had. Do your self a favor and order one. And one is all you'll need as they are BIG! Enjoy.
