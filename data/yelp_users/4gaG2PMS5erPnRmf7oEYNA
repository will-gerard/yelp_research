My husband and I highly recommend Shane co.  We've gone through them before for our rings and found the quality exceptional, especially compared to other diamond stores. Not only was the price lower, but the rings seem to keep longer.  We got our ring set from Shane Co and ordered a loose Canadian diamond  from a different source, only to find out that the diamond didn't fit our original set and it needed a new mount to be set to fit it. Even though we didn't purchase the diamond from them, they mounted it for free (in two days no less!) and  not only allowed us to keep the warranty on the original set, they warrantied the diamond for free.  Even better was how beautiful it was when they were done. It was a much larger diamond and really didn't look like it would fit well in the ring and would look off. They assured me that not only would it look great, but they would place it down as far as possible. When I got it, it was BEAUTIFUL! It sits down as low as possible, is very secure, and absolutely beautiful. Did I mention it was beautiful?

Awesome place! Doctor is very caring and will give you the time of day. He's willing to give you the time of day and ensure that you are well cared for. His staff are exceptional as well! He was actually priced right in the ballpark of the top lasik doctors (if not a little bit cheaper) in Phoenix.

Love love love their "usually" fresh bread and their food is fantastic. My husband and I frequent here a lot and have seen some horrible servers and a lot of turnover, but the food is always magnificant!

We went on a very early afternoon lunch and the food was fabulous. It was fresh and inside was quiet, of course we were the only ones there, but the staff were obnoxious and rude. We got snuffed at when we walked in, the waitress wouldn't look at us, and was slow to bring us drinks.  The only reason it got 4 stars was because of the sushi was so good and different from what I'm used to.

Apparently I have no luck with getting my haircut, because this is where I met my first Edward Scissor-hands of the month.  I'll start off by saying I go to the Red Door often enough. Kim is absolutely wonderful for waxing, Sarina is perfect for wraps, and Bill is awesome for massages. And for hair?  Gaston is just wonderful, I love him to pieces. I'm also a very quiet person and every person I've seen respects that and does not try to talk my ear off. The particular Saturday I went in, I made a last minute appointment and saw Jazmin, someone I had not seen before. I was pleasantly surprised when my shampoo, haircut, and paying all took less then 15 minutes! I mean, who likes to waste 30+ minutes on a hair cut?! I asked for a simple haircut, a long bob to shorten up my hair, about 3-4 inches taken off. Once home, I did my hair as I normally do and found out I had a new friend! My husband and I deemed him Whispy. Who is Whispy? As you can see in the pictures, Whispy is an extra piece of hair that is a bit longer then the rest of my hair. He's the sole 'survivor' of my hair hacking. So I trailed myself back into the salon and showed Alexis at the front to which I was refunded and offered to have Gaston fix it when he had a spot open.  Next day, Jazmin called me and asked what was wrong with my haircut. I think she was worried for Whispy's safety seeing as how she really really wanted me to come in before my Saturday appointment with Gaston. After speaking with her a bit, she was very upset that I would not come in. (Anyone who reads this review, please do not tell her Whispy died, I think she'd be devastated!) Saturday came and left, It is with heavy heart that I report Whispy was put to death   by Gaston on 2/21/15. I hope that Gaston gave him a proper burial.  Gaston made my hair beautiful and wonderful again and I've received many positive compliments.I'm very thankful that he went above and beyond to fix my hair and do it so absolutely beautifully. If it weren't for him, I'd be swearing off all haircuts for my family considering my recent luck with hack jobs. Now the real question is, how much to take my 5 year old to him?!  In the week that I was blessed with Whispy, I was complimented with various compliments including: Did you fall asleep and the kids cut your hair?  My $13 Great Clips haircut looked better. Good morning Edward Scissor-hands. and my personal favorite: Look at it, laugh, shake head, walk away....

Plenty of lines open, each had 2-3 people waiting to check out. We choose the one line with only 1 person.  Fast forward to 25 mins later, the lady is having a breakdown because there's not enough money in her account but doesn't want to give up some of her food. There's crying and a big scene, with her kid having a tantrum (we had no clue what was going on at the time). Were stuck behind her with our entire cart unloaded already.  One of the other employees actually came around and paid for the rest of her order. It was fantastic to see someone actually care and step up to help.

Went to the ER, my toddler was in severe pain, screaming bloody murder from it and nothing helped. Their response? To quote the NP, "It just looks like he needs a good time out." "He must just be having night terrors." (as he cries and screams in pain for an hour straight in front of her). "This is absolutely normal behavior for a 2 year old." "Well you know, 2 year olds scream." and the classic of all classics, "What do you expect me to do? It's 10 o'clock at night." Um, you're an ER, my child has not stopped screaming. Blood work, something? Anything? Her response? She refused to do blood work, urine sample, anything!?!? Then refers us to Neurology at PCH which I told her doesn't take our insurance. I'm sorry, but how is this exemplary care?

I'm been here numerous times and received *okay* service, but this last time it was just terrible! Typically I'm there to meet clients as Starbucks is generally a nice place to do so in a quiet, relaxing atmosphere.  Let's start by saying my name is Morgan. Yes Morgan, a unisex name. I am a girl and have known many Morgans both male and female. I've even run across a few unscrupulous business people who question if I am really Morgan (generally for credit cards, banks), however while they sound skeptical and ask more then the typical security questions, never, and I mean never, have I been so horrified and embarrassed as I was in this Starbucks. Nor have I ever met someone quite so ignorant and rude.  The other day, I went into the Starbucks with clients and when I handed my card to the cashier, he asked if 'he' was with me. When I replied "he?" the cashier continued to look around us (a group of females) and ask where was "he, Morgan". Apparently 'he' needed to be around to show his ID. My jaw dropped! I replied that I am Morgan to which he looked at me skeptically, sighed, then brashly stated that I needed to show him my ID.  Last I knew the appropriate way to handle this situation would have been to politely ask for my ID, not to assume (ignorantly so, mind you) that I am not the person on the card because, well, Morgan must be a male only name! More over, once he knew that I was in fact Morgan, being rude beyond that point was just uncalled for and unprofessional on so many levels. Worst yet, he never apologized, you would think for that much he would have. Nope, nothing. It certainly left a lasting imprint on my clients which had a few (mind you highly embarrassing) chuckles at my expense.  Thanks for the laugh. Guess I'll find somewhere else to waste my money.

Ordered on the handy dandy app, picked up at drive through like I normally do. Easy, quick, efficient. Get home and finish off my oh so yummy drink and realize they left me a little surprise! A wonderful fly at the bottom of my drink. Yum.... So I called the store. Their response? "Oh, would you like to come in and exchange it for a new one?" Nope, nope, little fly guts, nope. Okay, her response next? "Well, then what would you like if not a replacement drink?" Well, like maybe for you to tell the manager or get him/her on the phone with me, because fly guts. "Oh, well, I'll let the manager know. They're busy right now." Great, thanks....  Glad we solved the issue of little fly guts in my drink....

Wow! Never have I been more upset. I asked for a "more natural white walls, I don't want large white walls" on my son's haircut. Her cut? There are chunks of hair that weren't even cut along the sides. The two sides aren't even symmetrical. With his glasses on, one sideburn comes down below his glasses while the other is not visible at all. One area above his ear is cleaner cut then the other side.  After we had paid, I took a close look at him and went back to her and asked her to fix it. She asked what was wrong. I told her and showed her, she promptly turned her back to me WHILE I was still talking to her and she refused to look at what I was talking about. To me, this was completely unacceptable. You do not turn your back while a customer is talking to you and outright refuse to look at the mess. She finally turns around and says that I asked for "natural white walls" so that's what she gave me. Mind you, she still has not looked at it. I repeat to her that there are chunks of hair and it's not even close to being symmetrical. She repeats several more times, while refusing to look at it, that this is what I asked for. Then she proceeds to say, someone else will fix it and reemphasizes, this is what I asked for.  First off, when a customer comes back UNHAPPY, a business should NEVER ever turn their back while the customer is talking. I was not yelling, I was talking nicely, she had not reason to turn her back to me.  Secondly, you look at the hair and see what it is the customer is talking about. She never did. Thirdly, you don't tell a customer this is what you asked for, especially without first seeing what is wrong.  I would have never left this negative review and would have left a very happy customer is these three things did not happen. The point that these things did happen show that this place is extremely unprofessional and shoddy and sooner or later, i'm sure you'll end up with an equally shoddy haircut. My son has been getting the same hair cut for 3 years now, every time I ask for the same thing. Never once in those many many times have I  ever had someone cut his hair unevenly or leave chunks of hair around his ears because I asked for 'more natural looking whitewalls'. There is a distinct difference between not giving a child whitewalls and leaving chunks of hair and unevenness. Here are 4 pictures so that maybe she will finally look at what I was talking about and others can see what a hack job she really is. On his right sideburn, you can see where it is shorter then his left sideburn. You can also see where each sideburn has strands of hair that are longer along the ear then the rest of the sideburn. You can see where one side behind his ear is more cleanly cut then the other side, but where each side has long uneven hairs.

You can see where one side behind his ear is more cleanly cut then the other side, but where each side has long uneven hairs.   You can see from the two sets of pictures of each side of his face where they were not even close to being symmetrical. With his glasses on, his right sideburn is hidden and the left is actually below them. I'm sorry, but when does a haircut qualify as the customer's fault (as she so tried to blame me) when its not even, symmetric, and there are literal chunks? In the end, she offered to have another lady fix it, because she just didn't have time for it. All the while blaming me for wanting a natural haircut. She claimed repeatedly that this was a natural haircut. This would have been an entire different review had they just fixed it rather then try to claim that I was responsible for it for requesting him not to have huge white walls on the side of his face. Shitty hair cut is not my fault, sorry.

Shady much? We went in for lunch on Sunday. After the back messed up my burger, the waiter argued with me about if it was the right burger or not. Then, after a 10 minute wait for the right burger, he stated he would remove the burger from the bill for the wait.  Here's where it gets shady. He comes with the bill and says manager wouldn't approve the removal. Alright, no biggie. But then he takes the bill back and offered to pay $5 on it, but brings back a different bill instead for $45. I pay with credit, he turns around and charges my card for $60 and hands me back the receipt which says it was ran for the $60, but no itemized bill. Didn't say a thing, brought it to me quickly with his head down, dropped it and ran. Couldn't find him after that to clear it up.  I didn't much care for the wait and I'm not upset that my order was put in wrong. I'm not even put off by being told they'd clear the burger off my receipt, then them not doing it. Instead, I'm a bit worried at how shady that waiter was, changing out receipts, charging more then he was supposed to, then disappearing instead of speaking up about it. If he's acting shady about a receipt, I wonder what else he is doing....

This is our to go pizza place. Love the ideology of organic, natural, good for you pizza. When going for a quick dinner, we can get gluten free for my husband and son who have gluten allergies and vegan for me. I can also guarantee that my son isn't getting all those nasty extra ingredients found everywhere else that aren't exactly healthy. Prices are ok, if you don't add everything to the pizza, it's lower then most other places. I have only found one good deal on it tho, so I'm wondering where i can get this 50% off!

So after coming here for a couple years now, I have to say in disappointed in them.  First off, the area where they put the ginger, wasabi, etcetera is disgusting. Never been cleaned type of disgusting. It was 1130am, they open at 11, so you know it was from not being cleaned at all. This wasn't one occasion either. I had to visit my Uncle at the VA everyday and this was my lunch spot. It never looked clean.  Secondly, their kids meals are disgusting. My son loves sushi, not so much the kids meal. The rice is stale and absolutely different and gross tasting. He likes salmon on his roll, when I asked the charge they told me 0.75 extra, but they charged me for a full add (2.50). Since they only gave me half of the normal serving (since the roll is half the size), but charged me full, I asked for them to add the other piece to the side, which they refused! They made such a huge condition about it that it was embarrassing.  Thirdly, their employees that have been there are fantastic. The new ones are pretty horrible. All my bad experiences are with the new group. Every single time I've been in has had some bad customer service related experience.  If they cleaned it back up, made fresh kids sushi, and replaced those newbies, I'd love to continue to go.
