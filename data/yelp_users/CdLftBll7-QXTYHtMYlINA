Probably my favorite place to go in Tempe. Great Beer made on site and the best "bar" menu out there. There daily specials are always awesome and usually temp me into visiting more time than I should. My favorite plave to take out of town guests.

First off, I should say that this is my gym. I love it and that's why It's my gym. The staff is veru friendly and the gym is clean and neat. The locker rooms and bathrooms are spotless. The best part is the instructors, from boxing and muay thai to brazilian jiu jitsu and mma it is all first rate and the best place I have trained at in AZ or anywhere else for that matter. I highly reccomend. The owners are also very nice if you happened to run into them, a huge plus in my book.

I was excited about this place because I am a huge acai fan. So, I go in (15 min ago) and there are 3 high school kids working there, 2 on laptops and 1 behind the counter. I wasn't greeted when entering and when I ordered the kids got up from their laptops without washing there hands or putting on gloves and made my acai bowl. Had I not paid I would have walked out. I can't tell you if the food was good because I threw it away. Thanks for the wasted $7. I would have prob came in a few times a week.
