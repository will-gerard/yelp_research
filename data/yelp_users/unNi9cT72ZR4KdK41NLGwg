Came in after hiking Cholla Trail on a Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend and another couple. We were just looking for a place to grab a quick snack and some drinks and conversation. Not really expecting much but cold beer and hot food. The place was almost empty but that did not stop our waitress and the bartender from getting two of the four drinks wrong. This escalated when they managed to get three of the four meals wrong, the service was poor and after the fifth mistake in our order my friend finally complained about the bad service and continual mistakes and the waitress left and was replaced by a surly floor manager who was unprofessional, antagonistic, and confrontational. He did everything short of picking an actual fight with me. What started as a nice outing with friends turned into an ugly ordeal where I will never go back and am suggesting to all of my friends that they avoid the place as well. There are plenty of places where I can grab a bite to eat, a beer and not have some arrogant asshole of a floor manager come over and throw his machoness around to impress the female wait staff and bartenders at mine or friend's expense. Way to unimpress.

Awesome experience. Jenifer is friendly, professional, and does exceptional work. Having never experienced facial, dermaplaning and microabrasions I was nervous at the beginning. Jenifer does a great job explaining what all the treatments are and what they do. Her care and attention to detail is superb and I would highly recommend visiting her spa for any of her treatments and services.

What a great find. Thin crust pizza cooked up fast and delicious. Build your own pizza or have them build one fresh for you. Either way, both are great choices and another visit is a must.
