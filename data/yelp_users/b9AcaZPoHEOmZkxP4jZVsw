Dear Einstein,   I like your bagels! Your locations are very convenient. However, when I pay $7 for a bagel and lox - I expect there to be more than two fish scales. In the future, please inform your employees to not make excuses based on the weight of the bagel for less lox. Then an offer for an additional $5 for two more measly pieces that were expected in the first place. Einstein, you may be a theoretical bagel-living genius, but you really dropped the ball this time! In the words of Arnold, I'll be back.   Thanks for the pickle,   David

Let me first say, I like Frank's food. They have a wide selection of food and everything at least USED TO BE great. Seems to be a few months ago something changed... Delivery now takes forever, orders are wrong, customer service is nonexistent, the wings contain little meat now, and no managers to be found.   The way they've changed their business makes me regret that I had my whole office ordering from them. Granted if you order a cheese steak sandwich, it could be confused with cheese sticks. That's why an order taker should repeat your order back to you.   Last time I had a problem with them was the first time I've ever had a problem. I was hoping it was a one time thing. The manager at the time rectified it with fixing my order and offering me 20% off my next order. Good deal. Even though I had to wait 2+ hours to receive the wrong order, I try to be understanding.   This time there was no rectification, not even a call returned. I had to wait over an hour for my food when I was quoted 30 minutes. When I called to find out where it was, I was told they were busy. When the delivery driver had to inform me they were out of something (the reason I ordered from them in the first place) AND the order was wrong, I was hungry and cranky to say the least. I called back in to speak to the manager because they gave me an appetizer instead of a sandwich, he was conveniently not there. The order-taker offered to make me a sandwich and deliver it to me personally. I was satisfied with that. To my dissatisfaction, he called me five minutes later with another excuse that it was the end of the night and they had turned off the machines. It's obvious lack of management when a business is open for 15 more minutes and should be taking orders in that time to maintain profitability. So lazy employees decide to take off early.   Hopefully they will change back to the way things used to be and I can order in confidence once more. Until then, if you order from them - pick it up so you know if it's wrong right away and you don't have to wait at least twice of the quoted time. If you order delivery, I suggest ordering the exact opposite of what you want. This way, they might get something right.   Why, Frank's? Why did you have to break my pizza loving heart?

I feel as though they should change their name. They're not very express and give you no chopsticks! The food isn't bad, but you can definitely get better in Tempe. I probably won't order from them again. Seriously, what's up with that astronomical delivery charge and no receipt?

Eh.... What can I say? It's a nice place. The steak is cooked well for ordering medium rare. The vegetables, were however pretty darn good. That's a start!   Okay okay. I'll be very honest. They need to replace their chef and revamp their pricing and their menu. It's Biltmore pricing for a downtown venue. Most people that go downtown are not looking to make an impression by going somewhere fancy looking and pricey. We're looking for great taste and good value, which I feel this place is lacking. If it's worth twenty to thirty something dollars a plate, I'll come back and keep on spending it.   My experience here wasn't bad. It was date night and I wanted steak. Our server was very sweet and decently educated about wine (though I'm no expert myself). The bread they serve at the table is very good. Then again, I guess it has to be as we ate all of it before our food came out. As I stated earlier, my steak was cooked wrong - but I was too hungry to wait for another one.   I forget what Dena got... I think some sort of seafood pasta? I tasted it and was just okay.   The wine was good!   When it all comes down to it, the over a hundred dollars I spent... I would much rather go to Durant's or Cibo. Hell, I'd rather cook at home and get a vintage wine for that money.   Sorry 1130. I don't like writing negative reviews, but honesty is important. Switch it up and we'll give you another shot.

Unless I'm in a bind, this is the only barber shop I'll go to. Normally I go to Eric, but if he's not there - everyone else is very talented. Not to mention, $17 for the amount of effort and detail they put in, a free beer, GOOD MUSIC, and supporting a local business? I'm all for it.   I've gone to the expensive Russian guys, they do a good job, but you walk out with $50 less in your wallet and no beer.   I'll tell you this: If it's the weekend and you're looking horrendous - either set an appointment or deal with waiting. It's worth it. Let's put it this way, patience is a virtue and good things come to those who wait. You'll remember that next time that pretty girl at the bar chooses your friend who got his hair cut here over you and your clippers at home.   Also, if you decide to trade your man-card in for a shave, they'll do that for you. They probably won't even make fun of you.

Like feeling like you live in the 90s? Like mostly horrible music? You found the place that for all of its downfalls has an awesome staff, amazing whiskey selection, and very good food! So leave your wallet chain at the door - come on down, slap on the khaki cargo shorts, put the oakleys on the back of your already backwards hat, and prepare for the best experience across the street from Hipster Chili's!!!

A neighborhood favorite! Then again, I love Pho.   When you come in, I suggest you get a seat with a good view of all the other seats. Watching people eat noodles is incredibly fun! Get a drink, any drink will do. They actually have a "Surprise Me" option on their bar menu. I think the bartenders are psychic and showing off, because they bring you what you really want deep down inside.   Unless you're an expert on Vietnamese food, it takes a few tries to figure out what is "your dish". The first couple of times I came here, I was always satisfied with my food - but I would see what someone else was ordering and transform into a bulimic goblin/wizard wanting to change my order after the fact. After a strict rehab - I can now happily say, I even know what hot sauce mixture I want in my pho. TAKE THAT GOLEM!!!   Now keep in mind, this is historic Phoenix we're talking about here. Most of these restaurants are old houses that have been renovated to be the wonderful restaurants they are. It can get cramped/cozy/claustrophobic/small/youhavetogetthepointbynow. That's part of the appeal.   I'll end saying this. If you want comparable Pho, go to LA or Vietnam.

I've been putting off writing a review of Wy-Knot.... Mainly because it's my FAVORITE! Every single experience I've had here has set the bar for every other place I go. Be patient, and I'll tell you all about the food.   Here's the typical experience, and the reason I love this place is that what I'm about to tell you IS TYPICAL! You walk in, sit down, and are greeted by the kindest people. It's like they know what kind of mood you're in, or even what kind of mood you want to be in. If you're in a rush and getting something to go, they're pretty fast for how high quality the food is. If you're extremely hungover, they somehow cure it! I don't know what it is... The well lit ambience, the wonderful staff, the coffee, the green tea, the amazing food? It's the 11th wonder of Phoenix.   Now, onto the food!   They do this thing where they keep it simple, but add some really advanced stuff. I mean, I can cook, but I'm not some sort of expert chef. The way they use their seasoning and mainly season with vegetables, sets them apart from the rest. You're going to spend about as much as you would at some tasteless cookie cutter franchise, but you feel good after. The amount of food that comes out on your plate is thoroughly impressive. I am not a salad eater, but their cobb salad is the tastiest looking salad I've ever seen. Get Jackie's signature french toast! I'm not a big fan of cinnamon french toast, and I love this stuff.   I once had some sort of obscure cold vegetable something soup that was purple. I was sure it was going to be disgusting. Well, I have to tell you.... Sometimes it's good to be wrong. AND! If Jackie is proving you wrong, he is steering you in the right direction. I want it again, but I'm not sure if it's seasonal or what. Half of which, I can't remember what it's called.   My point is this... You can't go wrong with Wy-Knot. Not to be an elitist, but if you've been here and don't like it - we are not friends.    *****DISCLAIMER***** I don't use the word "love" unless I mean it, so take it seriously when I'm talking about this place and their food.  Just because I show up at 1PM on a weekend hungover from a wonderful night partying with friends, does not make any of us alcoholics. Well.... maybe some...  There's nothing "typical" about Wy-Knot except for being exceptional.  I don't eat salad. I don't even like lettuce. However, the way they prepare their food - I'll eat it that way.  I'm extremely allergic to bananas, so please don't bring it up and don't try to poison me - I can smell them from across the room. I'll know.  I eat here as often as I can convince my girlfriend to not want something else.

This place is great! It's like a step above Filiberto's. Their menu prices inside are not consistent with their online prices though. Still worth it and still delicious! The people that work there are very nice, and the atmosphere isn't too bad considering the neighborhood.   You definitely want to be careful when you're parking. The lot looks like it was extended and I noticed a couple of pieces of metal sticking out of the ground that could easily flatten your tire(s).   They have a great presence on yelp, which is how I found them in the first place, and offer some pretty good deals for yelp users! If you're in the downtown Phoenix area, check them out. You won't regret it!

This place is BAD ASS!!!  I eat here pretty often considering it's right by my new office. The guys that own/run the place & their employees are nicer than most people in Scottsdale.   The food.... THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!! They grill their sandwiches, (a grilled gyro? = heaven!) they use FRESH ingredients, all in all - they do it right.   The prices aren't that bad either. Sure, you can go to Tempe and get a gyro with fries for $6.99 and it's alright. This is a much healthier, tastier option for around $10 including a drink.   If you're in North Scottsdale shopping around this ridiculous shopping center, check them out. They're a little tucked away, right by a smoke shop off Northsight on Butherus.   Try the jalapeno hummus!

It made a lot of sense that this place only has 3 stars even though it's pretty popular. Here right now with a very large party. They definitely had a table that we requested that would comfortably accommodate all of us. However, that request was blatantly ignored. Once we took it upon ourselves, we were scolded by our waiter? Now, I really want you to keep in mind I am completely sober due to a medication I'm taking. If it weren't for a dear friends birthday, I would not step foot in this place. The food is actually pretty good and they have some interesting drinks. The portions are very small and overpriced. Now, because of the inconsiderate staff, some of our more emotional party members are getting their feelings hurt by half the party having to sit elsewhere. Culinary dropout, I am disappointed in you just like your teachers and parents were. Grow up already.
