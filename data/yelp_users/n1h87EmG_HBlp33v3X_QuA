We were invited here by some friends on Saturday night to celebrate another friend's birthday.  It's been a couple years since my last visit to Simpleton's but one thing that I remember was their burgers and fries.  In fact, a couple of us have since referred to the burgers as "BABs" (big a** burgers).   That's the first thing we ordered and I wasn't disappointed.  The burgers are big, juicy and tasty.  The large portion of fries on the side hit the spot too.  I'd say that Simpleton's lives up to its name.  It's a small bar, not too fancy and no frills but the food I've tried is good and priced right.  If you're thirsting for draft beer, they have domestic pitchers for just $7.   However, if you're looking for a bar that mixes quality specialty drink or shots, this probably isn't your place.  We ordered "Washington Apples" - they ended up being really watery and overpriced.  I'd go back for a BAB though!

I have a rule about Mexican restaurants.  The first time I visit, I always order their tacos.  If the tacos are good, I can usually count on being able to find other items on the menu I'll also like.  A couple of weekends ago, we arrived at Cafe Posada just after 11am on a Sunday morning.  The interior of the restaurant was nice and much more spacious than it looks from the outside.  Since it was still early, we were the second table seated for the day.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  I ordered shredded beef tacos.  After a few minutes, our plates came out to the table.  The plates were hot and the rice and beans were pretty tasty.  However, the tacos didn't cut it.  It seemed like the shredded beef was leftover from the day before and as if all the flavor had been cooked out of it.  So my dilemma is, the atmosphere and service were good but the food was really bland.  I'm still deciding if I'll give Cafe Posada another shot. Maybe I'll head back on a Friday evening.

I've driven past La Stalla Cucina Rustica several times on my way to 98 South or El Zocalo but for some reason I'd never eaten there.  It might be the long, multi-syllabic name...places with names like that can be a little intimidating sometimes.  Still, I was in the mood for a different spot and Italian cuisine sounded good so I thought we'd give it a try.  I had the Penne alla Vodka.  Let's just say, my plate was clean at the end.  My experience with the service was really good. The only hiccup during our visit is that the glass of wine the person I was with ordered had little bits of cork in it.  I mentioned it to our server and they quickly apologized and replaced it.  No harm done!  We finished off having the tiramisu for dessert.   It had a really good flavor and the portion size was perfect for sharing.

For me, when I'm craving a good 'ol breakfast like eggs, pancakes and hash browns,  the Hangar Cafe has all the staple menu items.  I recently had a Denver Omelet that really hit the spot.   Saturday and Sunday mornings can be busy so you might have to wait, but it's worth it!

Two words: BULK SHOPPING.   Some might say it's an addiction, but I have to admit, I get caught up in it myself sometimes.  This is a nice Sam's Club location.  Clean and easily accessible off the 202 and AZ Ave.  Oh, and that previous tip about clearance stuff ending in .71 or .81 - I'm going to have to look into that one!

So you want a good cup of coffee, homemade bakery items, friendly employees that remember your name along with what you like to order, AND complimentary wi-fi for customers?  Give this independently owned coffee shop a try.  Weekend mornings you can even listen to live music out front.

I was among the large group several other reviewers mentioned that visited Blue Adobe Grille. The points they made in their reviews were right on the money. Because of that, I'll keep this short and add just a few more.  The one server taking care of the group was hit and miss. He paid attention to some and seemed to ignore others. I was encouraging him to go around the table to take each order but instead would take one at a time back to the kitchen, and ignore others as he was walking away. Not very efficient. Still, he was trying, so I'll give him that. One of the two stars above goes to him.  I shared a chicken quesadilla and bean queso dip appetizer. Nothing complicated, but it WAS good. The plates others had looked appetizing also - when and if they ever got them. That accounts for the second star.  The manager, walked up to me at one point near the end of our visit. I was standing by our assigned 4 tables chatting with another person in our group. In an annoyed voice she said, "I'm going to have to ask you to not crowd the other tables."  I was 3 feet away from the next table - I counted the tiles on the floor just to make sure. Is 3 feet considered crowding?    Those three blank stars? Lack of follow-through, lack of service and lack of accountability by the manager.

I've lived near downtown Chandler for over 6 years now.  One of the better kept secrets is how Arizona Avenue between Chandler Blvd and Frye has been revitalized.  There are several restaurants that offer great atmosphere, a comfortable dining experience and a wide variety of wines and cocktails.  98 South is no exception.  If you like a casual happy hour with a great choice of wines and martinis, give them a try.  If you like beer , they have a good selection including Stella Artois (of which I'm a recent convert to!)  Try a couple of their appetizers and share with whoever you go with.  I'm a big fan of the warm almond crusted brie plate and the skirt steak starters.    The staff at the bar are friendly and extremely helpful when you need a recommendation for wine or food.
