Marc's is a dive bar, keep that in mind. It ain't a Scottsdale club!! It does the job, Strong drinks but dirty glasses. Bartenders are cool.

I am very discerning of Greek food and cuisine and Ive been to many Mediterranean restaurants across the valley. Greek Wraps is delicious and has so many options. It's filling and left my whole family satisfied.

This is as authentic as it gets for Italian grocery. The family is very friendly and the service is fast. I recommend buying/stocking up on olives and going with the Italian Combo sandwich on sourdough. Writing about it makes me want to go back!

The margherita pizza at la piazza al forno is delicious. The atmosphere is welcoming and reminds me of pizzerias all across Naples. A gem in the west valley. Steffano is a gracious host and quite hospitable. Will definitely visit this restaurant in the future.

The pancakes are to die for. Like everyone has been saying, the quantity of food will feed an army!! Good to see a classic diner really put roots down in Glendale. The line for this place is out the door on Sunday mornings. and I'm glad I braved the elements to experience Ronnie's Cafe.

A fantastic gym, even though it's under the management of LA Fitness now. It could use a couple more squat racks, but other than that, it's great.

Even though it's located in a strip mall, the restaurant is authentic and the food is delicious. One of the best Mexican places in Glendale and the west valley. The Happy Hours on weekdays are also great for unwinding and have a wide selection of drinks.

I've never had my carpets cleaned, and there seems to be no shortage of qualified companies in the Phoenix metro area. Despite this wide array of choices, I decided to go with Elite Floor & Furniture Cleaning. Justin was very helpful and upfront about all costs. He arrived on time and did the job in less than an hour. I am very, very pleased with the results and look forward to working with him in the future!

Went with Justin and his staff at Elite again and was not disappointed. He does the job quick and thoroughly, and gives some great advice on how to maintain the carpets. I will definitely enlist the services of Elite in the future.

B-dubs in Westgate isn't very fun. The food left something to be desired. Wings were cold and I felt like I threw my money down the drain. Good tv options for the game but stay away from cuisine.

Great place and great atmosphere. Went last weekend with family who were from out of town and they want to go back as soon as they visit PHX again.

Great food. Great atmosphere. I've traveled all over the country for great barbeque, and this is it. I can't wait to go back with my family and friends!

With all the hype, I thought I'd check out the Desert Diamond WV. After spending an hour of my life there, I want that hour back. It's just not fun...a step above an arcade with the electronic slots. This place falls WAY short of a place that can be considered fun. I was also disappointed in the fact that I couldn't even get a beer or drink to unwind!! Never going back and will never recommend it as a place to spend your hard earned money.
