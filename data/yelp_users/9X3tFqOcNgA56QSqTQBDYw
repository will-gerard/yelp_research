I am totally in love with this place! It is soooo good. I usually just get a shredded beef chimi, with red sauce and it is very good.   besides that, I HATE leftovers, but whenever I bring home leftovers from si senior, i always eat it. Their food is still good the second day.   They also have sopapillas- either regular or cinnamon.  and free chips, with 4 different kinds of dips. I am not a big dip person, but when I took my dad here he loved it!   The service is also good. :)

I have passed this place so many times, and thought it sounded gross. But I went there yesterday and LOVED it. The waffles were good. And the Red Velvet cake was so amazing. Definitely one of my favorite red velvet cakes.    I haven't tried any chicken, but I bet it's good.

I love scrapbooking and this is my favorite scrapbooking store! The first time I went in I was so overwhelmed by everything they had. They have an entire room of rows and rows of paper. They have tons of ribbons and they sell fabric.   Anytime I need any scrapbooking supplies I come here.

It's pretty good.   One time they did have a sign in the line that said, "8 minutes from this point", like they were disneyland or something.   But the burgers are good, and the fries. and the cheesy sauce is good for dipping.

This place is pretty cool. It's expensive but I love it. My husband and I went and did the four course meal. First we got a salad, then an appetizer of cheese with bread, apples and vegetables to dip into it. Then we got meat and cooked it at our table. Then we had dessert; we did the salted chocolate and to dip into it they gave us: bananas, strawberries, cheesecake, rice crispy treats, pound cake, oreo marshmallows, and graham cracker marshmallows.   I would come back here but I would just do the cheese (appetizer) and the dessert. The salad was good, but not anything special. And the meat was fine, but it was more like stew, and you had to be sure you cooked it enough. It's a pretty cool place, it does take a good 2 hours if you do all four courses, but it's fun.

My husband and I just stayed here for an anniversary and I loved it! The room was a good size and the bathroom was huge. This hotel is huge and so unique. I also love the forum shops. I will definitely stay here again.

Fry's is where I do ALL my grocery shopping. They have everything, and pretty cheap. Getting a Fry's VIP card is amazing. It saves you lots of money. I think it's alot cheaper than some of the other grocery stores.  Also, one of the best things is self-check out. i know most places have it, but there are still some grocery stores that don't.

I use to love Barnes and Noble. Me and my best friend would go in there late at night and each find a book, and sit and read for hours.   Me and my boyfriend even do it sometimes. But every time I go now, I swear it is the last time! They seriously harass you.   "Are you a member of our secret secret club? -no "Do you want to be??" -no "It will save you money" -no thanks. "okay." can I have your email so we can send annoying emails to you everyday?" -no.  and then they annoy you some more. It is seriously easier to just order books online so I don't have to deal with people.

I use to like Cold Stone but no anymore. I always get gummy bears in my ice cream, but they only put a few in there; literally 2 gummy bears for a medium ice cream. It's annoying.

This Joann's is huge! I only had 30 minutes here before I had to go pick up my husband from school, and it was not nearly enough time. The fabric selection was amazing! There is a Joann's by my house but it's less than half the size of this one, I think I'll be coming here more often.

This is the only place I like to buy a car from. The people are not like the usual idiot car dealers.   I bought a car from them but after driving it for a few days I decided I didn't like it because it was really small. The had a 5 day return policy so I went and exchanged it and it was so easy. I still have the car I bought from them, and the next time I need a car I will go there.  I have also sold my car to them and it's also fast and easy.

This is my favorite frozen yogurt place! The yogurt is so good, and all healthy. All of their yogurt is either low fat or fat free or sugar free. and the toppings are good. The place is also really clean. It does get pretty crowded though. And they also seem to be the cheapest frozen yogurt place that I have found.

The workers were not helpful at all. They were also rude and too busy talking to each other and texting on their phones to pay attention and answer my questions. This place is awful.

I wouldn't come here again. We were going to buy a car, but didn't end up getting it and the lady was so unprofessional. She texted my husband 10 minutes after we left bothering him about the car.

Pretty good. The classic burger is good with the sauce; which is like frudruckers. And the smash fries are good too, but kinda greasy.

I had a friend who worked here so I use to get my hair done with her. After she left I have tried going back a few times but I always have a bad experience. The last time I had a pink streak put in my hair and I was told it would cost $20. At the end she charged me $80. It was ridiculous and I'm never going back again.

I didn't like this place. Red Velvet cake is my favorite, so me and my boyfriend are always trying to find a good one. First of all, this place looks more like a boutique than an actual cake place. Second of all, the Red Velvet didn't even taste like Red Velvet. It just taste like a bland chocolate cake.
