I driven by this place a few times, saying to myself, I gotta try it! I finally had the opportunity to & i was brutally disappointed!    I went during the lunch hour. Had an OK crowd inside. On the menu Board, it says "try it, you'll love it" So i did. I paid almost $7.00 for my steak sandwich. It didn't take that long to cook. (that part I was impressed.) When I got my sandwich, it was a skinny little thing. I took my first bite & the sweet peppers were cold. I usually like to eat the whole sandwich, but I had to leave pieces of bread behind because they were, just that, bread!  I've had steak sandwiches before (in philly) & they are soooo good. Nothing compares to it! but if your craving one, don't come here. Go to the other place that starts with a "C"

Walked in with my hungry, thirsty children. Waited in lobby for a hostess to seat us for 7 min. Mind you, there was no one waiting other than us. When we finally do get seated, we waited for another 10 min. We finally decide to leave when the server says 'oh, your leaving.' When I said "yes, we are, you took too long." She replied "well I was over there arguring.." I didn't even let her finish, because that's exactly what we wanted to hear.

If you enjoy eating pita bread carne Asada tacos, bland rice & black beans mixed with  some chili pepper, then this is the entr√©e for you!  We decided to have dinner there as the crew was setting up for NYE. They sat us in the back of the restaurant, off to the left of the stage. We were the only ones sitting there so we were very secluded from the rest of the restaurant crowd, we almost felt as if we got in trouble sitting there all alone.   The server was very nice & very excited that Omarion was going to be performing for their NYE festivities.   Our food came out in no time, which was a pleasant surprise. I ordered the carne Asada tacos. Presentation was nice. The black beans however looked as if there were bugs in it. It turned out there was chili pepper in it which made it difficult for this person to eat since I have an allergy. This was not mentioned in the menu on the plates description. The menu did day lime-cilantro rice. But what was served was white rice w some corn kernels mixed thru. The rice had no flavor whatsoever. I was unable to even apply some salt or pepper to help salvage it, since none was brought to the table & our server was no where to be found. to ask for any.   The carne Asada tacos were ok. The meat was tender & the sauce on top of the lettuce was tasty. The menu mentioned the tacos would be on corn tortillas, but what was on the plate was more like a very small pita bread. These tacos saved the plate from the sides it was served with.     Happy eating!
