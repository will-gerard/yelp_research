Something a little different from the usual Japanese food around the area. Try the skewers and ramen.

Whatever they call Durian on the menu isn't really Durian. Maybe that was Jackfruit.

'Open' sign was on and it was still about 6:35PM, but they were already closing up and putting stuff away. SMH.
