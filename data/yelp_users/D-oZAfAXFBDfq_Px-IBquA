After 10 years, I am giving this place another try.  i don't know why I waited so long.  Service was great and the Cheese Crisp was awesome.  Can't wait to go back.

I love their thin crust pizza.  I order the same damn thing everytime.  The food is good but it's not consistant.    I ask for thin crust, med pep pizza cut in square.  Everytime the crust is a different consistancy.  I don't know what to tell them to keep it the same.   The pizza is still good, I just wish it would be a bit more consistant.

I like this place.  It's close to my house and a great location for when I'm doing other errands.     A big plus is their color selection.  They seem to always have the new OPI colors right out in front.  **LIKE**  The staff can be pretty iffy at times.  I have a big pet peeve when people answer their phones while working on me.  It's rude.   Also, I know know it's cold/flu season so everyone is coughing.  They should be wearing the masks or not coming in to work at all.  STOP HACKING ON MY HANDS!!!

I feel like i'm the only person who didn't like this place.  My sister is a huge fan and went with me to order.  I had the Jade Chicken.  Bleh.   I tasted her food too but I don't recall what it was--still bleh.  I'll stick with the 'berto brothers for my bad mexican food.    Maybe I just don't like asian food?

I met up with some girlfriends during a pretty busy lunch rush.  The service was spectacular and didn't miss a beat even though every table was taken.    The rosemary chicken sandwich was awesome. The chicken phyllo apps were delish as well, loved the dipping sauce that came w/ them.   Our servers suggestions were spot on.

Awesome pizza and service.  The crust is my favorite but the toppings are impressive as well.  Try the white pizza or the calazone (light ricotta), you'll thank me later.

The restaurant is pretty comfortable.  The chairs and booths are really comfortable and a great spot for large groups.  The service can use a real improvement.  6 of us met there for dinner not knowing that there was a Coyotes game going on.  The bar was really busy but the dining area was, at best, half full.  Our food took forever and my glass of water was empty most of the meal.  I had ordered wine and asked for it to come with my meal but he gave it to me with the waters along w/ everyone else.    the food was alright.  pretty basic.  the meal could have been at Chili's, Applebees or any other assorted chain.  I would like to check their happy hour out one day, I sense it's a good deal.

I love this place.  the hotel rooms are comfortable and the dining options are fantastic.  My only gripe is with the pools.  I don't like to hang around all the kiddos at "the falls" so i tend to hang out at the pool next to the fitness center.  There is always trash on the ground and the fountain water is nasty!    The chairs are great and the service at the little cafe there is fantastic.  A quick trash pick up early in the morning and a fountain scrub will jazz that pool up quickly.

i LOVE rosati's!!!  When working in Glendale, they are my go-to pizza spot.  I loved them when I lived in Chicago and was thrilled to find out they had locations here.  I seem to desire pizza during peek times so delivery time is a bit poor.  Totally worth the wait though.

I met some girlfriends for a midweek lunch last week.  I peeked at their menu prior to going and was really looking forward to the Lobster Roll.  The description was mouth watering----the actual meal was bland at best.  It tasted like artificial crab meat and mayo.  I would have loved to send it back but our waitress was MIA most of the meal.  My girlfriends didn't have the time to wait for her to come back and extend our lunch hour.    I will say that the bread was to die for, it was the only perk to the whole meal.    Also, our waitress took FOREVER to bring our bill.  Once she gave it to us, it took even longer to bring back our cards.  For a restaurant in a busy downtown area, I would have expected faster service knowing that the majority of the patrons were here on a lunch break.  If a friend suggests this place again, I may go.  However, I'll keep looking around the area for a regular lunch spot.

The food was pretty good, nothing overly exciting.  I was impressed by the wine selection.  I would give this place a higher rating if their service was better.  It has been lackluster at best.

Stopped in before a movie for a bite to eat.  Food was meh and the service was the pits.  I really didn't need to hear the servers talk about bloody cuts and how they were in the hospital while I was eating.  Standing right in front of me!  I'll be going elsewhere

The food is always awesome.  Best in the area.     The people behind the counter need to pull their heads out of their asses.  Don't be rude to me if I ask for an extra bag to carry my food.  I'd be happy to let the food drop to the floor for you to clean up.

All the other reviews hit all my complaints. Poor service, horrible stench and waaay over priced drinks.   The only think missing was noting that I have TWICE seen a freaking baby/toddler in McFaddens well after the appropriate hour. If the 'bouncer' is checking ID's at the door....there should not be small children in the freaking place.   I wish I could go back and say sorry to all my hotel guests that i've sent there in the past.   I couldn't help but laugh at loud at the many tables w/  "reserved" signs on them.  The bar was half empty LOL

Pretty decent HH or "tiki time" prices.  I have been there 3x and had great service once.    Thankfully the place is so great that the lackluster service by the same waiter still had me coming back.  Much better this last time.  The Mac n Cheese is awesome!
