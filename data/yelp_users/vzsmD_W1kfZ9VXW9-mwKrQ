I have never been disappointed at any of the spinato's locations!  I first went to the one in Tempe. It's a weird location, in a business park. It's byob, wich was great! I tried the spinach pizza and I could not believe how perfect it was.  All the things I love at spinato's: The spinach pizza, sometimes I add sausage or meatballs. The L'Italiana. The get meaty. The mushroom sausage. The Bruschetta. If you want jalapenos on your pizza but others don't the will even heat them in the oven for you to put on at the table,instead of just slinging some cold ones at you. The service is always super friendly without being annoying. The only other pizza I like as well  in town is at pizzaria bianco. Give these people your money, they deserve it!!

I do not understand why people are saying this is the best carne asada they've ever had.This place is really horrible!   It was like having my old high school cafeteria making me tacos. Absolutely  no flavor in the meat! No flavor in condiments on taco or taco shell, or sauce. The amount of meat was very small. The chips and salsa was like it was from taco bell or something. The only flavorful thing I had there was the mexican bottled coke that was way overpriced, $3! Even the ambiance was low grade. Uncomfortable chairs and no personality. I am actually angry about this place getting good reviews. It is soooo easy to take beef, marinate it and grill it up and make it delicious.  Maybe the people who think this is the best carne asada should go to the closest roach coach and get a real carne asada taco, it would be cheaper and 100 times better.
