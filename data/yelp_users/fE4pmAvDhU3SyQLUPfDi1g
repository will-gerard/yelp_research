I was in need of a pedicure and a manicure badly. I didn't want to pay 50 bucks for them to clip my nails, though. So I called Peak Nail Spa and right away they were so happy to have me come in. I came is, was greeted immediately, and had such friendly and accommodating service. They didn't want to make me pay extra for services I didn't want an she really wanted to ensure I was happy when I left. I definitely recommend this place. Also the massage chairs are great!

I set an alarm on my phone just to make sure I wrote a review.   This is, by far, my favorite smoke shop ever. It's always clean, well stocked, and I find something new every time. The staff are knowledge, helpful, and friendly!  Always a recommend. My friends and I don't go anywhere else... If we can help it. ;)

I want SO BADLY to like this place!  Let me start by saying that the place itself is beautiful. It's always very clean, they are always showing the best games (lots of basketball! :), and the servers are lovely and friendly.  However, the food leaves something to be desired. I've gone two times now, and both times I was not pleased. The first time I went, I ordered the soft pretzels with queso dip. The pretzels were ok at best, and the dip was pretty gritty and cold. The second time I ordered steak nachos. My food was lukewarm, the cheese was already dried up, and the meat had a very distinct and foul taste.   I will more than likely return, because I really like the bar and sports coverage. I guess will just be ordering drinks.
