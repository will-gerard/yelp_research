Such a great place to hang out for happy hour. My friends and I lived the laid back atmosphere and the happy hour menu was perfect! The pretzel bites with the cheese were amazing.

I know this is a fairly new establishment, so I was willing to be somewhat lenient, but the more I think about our experience, I just don't think I could return. I guess what really got me is then they accidentally served my 10 year old alcohol. She ordered an ice tea and when she got it it tasted funny, we all tried it and it basically was alcohol. Even the waitress was shocked (yes we had her try it). I ordered the heirloom salad with chicken and it was bland. They used zero seasoning on the grilled chicken. My husband ordered a burger and it was too salty. My kids ordered the cheese pizza and they brought them out pepperoni. When I brought it to the servers attention, she apologized and took them back. 5 minutes later she returned with the pizzas that they had obviously just removed the pepperoni and added cheese too. I tried the pizzas and they were definitely frozen pizzas, not even fresh. To make up for our experience, they did offer us dessert but we declined. The positive thing about this place is the decorations. The decor is super cute and the chalk art on the walls are fantastic. Unfortunately we won't be back anytime soon.
