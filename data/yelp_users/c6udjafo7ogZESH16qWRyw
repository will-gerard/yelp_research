Short: Great consistent food. Good lunch deals. I get the House Special Chicken. Maybe a dollar or two expensive for the type of Chinese food it is.  Longer: Been going here for years and when I worked nearby I would go frequently at lunch. Their lunch specials are great and comes with soup and a vegetable egg roll. The only problem is that it's maybe a dollar or two too expensive for the type of chinese food it is. It's nothing fancy, just good solid Chinese food. The place is pretty big but is always packed when I go.   I personally get the House Special Chicken. Other good items depending on your mood:  Appertizers: Veggie Egg Rolls, West Lake Soup  Seafood: Almond and Cashew Nut Prawns  Chicken: Besides the House Special Chicken, Chicken in Black Bean Sauce  Pork: Sweet and Sour Pork  Also, I get the fried rice which is an extra $1 at lunch.  Service is super fast especially at lunch, otherwise, typical Asian service, not very personable and even if they were, it may be difficult to understand so maybe it's better to save for the awkward conversation anyways. Also, I'm not one for overly friendly (fake) service anyways, so it's not necessarily a bad thing.

Short Version: Consistently awesome service and delicious food. Every time. My favorites: Prime Rib Dip, Thai Steak Salad, Hawaiian Rib Eye, Ribs, California Roll (NOT your typical, trust me) and Chicken Sandwich.  Long Version: Hillstone is consistently busy so get there early (11:30 for lunch or 5:30 for dinner) to avoid a wait.  I have a friend who makes fun of me for this because he likes supporting the small local restaurants, but I'll say it again. Hillstone is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale. I come very frequently for lunch and on nights out with my wife for dinner. I'd say I've been to Hillstone 15-20 times in the last few months alone. Every. Single. Time. the service is awesome. And again, every single time, the food is awesome.   My favorites for lunch are the Prime Rib Dip (Best French Dip I've ever had) which, as the name suggests, uses slices of Prime Rib. It's no joke. The Au Jus is awesome too. If I want something a LITTLE lighter, and I say a little, because it still has steak in it, I get the Thai Steak Salad.  For dinner we typically get the Hawaiian Rib Eye and I recently discovered how awesome the ribs are, so I'll be throwing that in the mix too. Since it's dinner, we usually get the California Roll as an appetizer. I'm a big sushi fan, so I understand when every person I eat with is hesitant when I suggest the California Roll. It's truly unique and doesn't taste anything remotely close to the traditional "newbie" sushi roll everyone thinks of. Just try it. Also, when it's on season, we will get the grilled artichoke.  5/5 for service and 5/5 for food. Definitely a rare one. I'm sure I'm a bigger fan boy than most and have become biased.

Short Version: Good solid food. Might be slightly overpriced but for the ambience, location and being French I think it's to be expected. I'd recommend the Diver Scallops.    Long Version: Came with my wife on date night before a movie starting at 9:30. It was Saturday night around 7:30 when we got there and got in right away with no wait. Service was great and our server was personable. We split the French Onion Soup which is good but a bit overrated if you come in with knowing the hype of it being on "Best Thing I Ever Ate". Also, at $14, it's overpriced. Moved on to the Flat Iron Steak (medium rare) with Truffle Fries which was cooked perfectly medium rare (people usually overcook it) and the fries were good and comparable to Zin Burger's fries if you've ever had those. Nearly identical really. Also had the Diver Scallops which were our favorite for the night. Perfectly seared and comes on top of a bed of Risotto, Roasted Corn and Crispy Shrimp. The Shrimp was a pleasant surprise but the three huge buttery seared Scallops were perfect. That was definitely the highlight of the dinner. Next time we might try the dinner for two which is $112, I believe, and comes with your choice of fries or salad, a prime run steak and their soufflé which I'd definitely like to try next time. If you get the soufflé, order it at the beginning because it takes 20 minutes to prepare.

Just brought some friends from out of town (NY) and their only request was to sit outside to enjoy the weather before going back to the snow. Told the 1st host we had 7 people but forgot to mention "outside" but she had left to check out the table already so we followed up with the 2nd host (Asian girl) and asked if we could be sat outside and she said "We'll see what we can do". Ok. 1st host comes back and our table is ready and 2nd host (Asian girl) who we've been with the whole time walks us back to the table inside which prompts me to ask "So I take it this means we can't get a table outside?" To which she says "No". She didn't even try! We were with her the entire time!   I look out on the patio to find that there was indeed plenty of seating so I just asked the busser who was about to set down our drinks if we could sit outside and he took the initiative to go find if we could. Sure enough, it was no problem and 1st host made it happen (who was never informed of it in the first place).   So long story short, thank you to the busser and host #1 but Zinc Bistro, please tell Asian host lady that ignoring and blatantly lying about patron requests is no way to treat frequent diners.   All that said, after many times here, this was the first time we've ever experienced anything close to poor service. The rest of the meal with our friends was great. Don't let lazy Asian host lady ruin your rep.  I'm keeping a high rating because the food is great and the service is TYPICALLY good. It wouldn't be fair to let one lazy person ruin the overall experience.

My experience at Hacienda Lighting comes with such mixed emotions, but ultimately, as of this writing (it's not over yet), it's been a terrible experience. The first sales woman we dealt with was very nice and we told her we'd go home to measure some stuff and call in to buy the fan. We called and emailed and never got a response after two or three tries so we came in again. This should've been the first warning. We literally couldn't even give our money away to them, but that's okay because we ended up going with another fan as a result of coming in again.   On the second try, we went with a different sales woman (because why should we bother with the lady who wouldn't follow up on a ridiculously easy sale?) and she was also really great, this time we bought a fan and the outdoor pendant light while there since we had measurements. She was great, awesome in fact. Really took the time to run us through every possible option.  Then it went down hill. We were told we would get the fan within 3 weeks. Trusting their word, I didn't call to follow up until a couple days after week 3. That proved to be a mistake because no one knew where the fan was and it turns out it wasn't shipped out. (Keep in mind, every single time I call, the person I speak with is NEVER the person who has any sort of answer. And it turns out the person who has any sort of answer, simply doesn't call people back, at least he won't call me back. Maybe it's personal.) Long story short, after having to hound the crap out of them on a daily basis for an entire week because no one will call me back, they finally call the manufacturer and track down my $800 fan and schedule my installation a week later. So that 3 weeks turned into 6 weeks.   Installers came and were nice. They told me the fan wobbled when on high and a little bit on medium but because of the specialty fan, there isn't a way to balance it. He tells me to call back if it bothers me enough. Well, after a night of the fan wobbling even on medium, it bothers me. Back to the phone race. I've called every day since Monday and no one will call me back.   It's shocking how bad their communications skills are. Anyways, based on this experience so far, I would not recommend going here.  To be continued...

Some of my friends would make fun of me for eating at a "chain" establishment but there is a reason restaurants are able to turn into chains. They're good and consistently so. The service is great and again, consistent. My favorite dish is the oolong seabass. Delicious!

Short Version: 5/5 on service and 4/5 on food. Great consistent service and food. Get the Surf and Turf Tacos or the Salmon or The Fish of The Day. Best Arnold Palmer I've ever had! BRING BACK THE LOBSTER SLIDERS!!!   Long Version: I come here a couple times a week at least because it's very close to where I work. It can get spendy coming here so frequently, but you know exactly what you're getting and the type of service you'll receive. This restaurant seems to have their process locked down. There can be a wait some times during peak hours, so try coming 30 minutes before or after 12.   I typically get 1 of 3 things which are all great: Salmon, Fish of the Day or The Surf and Turf Tacos.   The salmon is baked perfectly so it's not too dry and not undercooked. It comes on a bed of the vegetables of the moment so it changes a bit from week to week.   Their Fish of the Day obviously changes, but I've never had a bad one. Yesterday I had the Striped Sea Bass and it was awesome. It was fried so the skin was perfectly crisp, but the fish meat was moist and juicy. It came on top of artichoke hearts, which were also perfectly tender.   The Surf and Turf Tacos come with tortillas, a side of Kale Salad, Filet Mignon and Seasoned Shrimp. Pretty self explanatory, but part of what makes this one so tasty is the chipotle sauce that comes with your tacos. You make your own tacos so I'm usually liberal with the chipotle sauce. I never end up with enough tortillas though so I always have to ask for more. The tortillas are on the thicker side, but very soft.  Last but not least, my absolute favorite thing at Chelsea's Kitchen that would've given them a full 5 out of 5 stars but they got rid of it, THE LOBSTER SLIDERS. It was a perfectly crisp lightly battered (perfect, not heavy at all) fried lobster with bacon inside two soft slider buns. Everyone at our office was pretty upset that they got rid of this. Total bummer.  The Arnold Palmer is so perfect. Fresh made lemonade and they do a funky thing with egg whites to create a fun foam in it. You don't taste any eggs in it, don't worry. Get it!

Ah, the ol' gave one star because you can't give 0 stars. I don't give this one out often, but Jambo was awarded this honor.  Some points:  1. This place smells like dirty feet.  2. It was muggy when I was in there  3. The manager (male one) berated my 4 year old nephew and mom because a nice employee told the 4 year old nephew that he could have a soda in his water cup.  4. The manager then demanded that my mom tell him which employee it was so he could fire them which makes for a great environment for children  5. This is personal opinion, but I would not trust my child around that same manager. He looked real sketchy and potentially pedo bear-ish. I mean, he yelled at a 4 year old for a 2oz cup of liquid. What does that tell you about his judgement?  Then again, maybe he's a great guy with a nice family and a great career path. I dunno, I mean Jambo is kinda like Disneyland right? Managers at Disneyland probably make good money, I bet. And they're around kids ALL DAY. And really, I haven't witnessed it before, so that doesn't mean it doesn't happen, but maybe the characters walk around Disneyland terrorizing the children when the adults aren't looking. Maybe Winnie the Pooh shoves your kids when they do something trivial.  Anyways, I just thought you should know to keep your eyes on your kids at this place. It contains foul smells, sketchy ventilation and a power hungry male manager that is certainly not of sound mind.

Short Version: Did the 6-course Tasting Menu which is spendy, but worth it. It would be a 5-star review but they were having front of the house issues and it didn't go as smoothly as they intended (which they admitted to). I got so many unique things I can barely remember what we got.  Long Version: We came here for our anniversary dinner so it was a very special occasion which helped justify the expense. You have a choice of ordering individual items from the menu, or doing a 4, 5 or 6-course tasting menu which is what they recommend. We did the 6-course which costs $95/person. You choose the 6 courses, but you get A LOT more items in between each course. All in all, we probably got around 15 items brought to our table. It was a very cool experience full of food that we had not even heard of before. The food is very inventive and the cost is worth it if not for the unique experience alone.  Everything was delicious and unique, but the stand out item for me was the Crispy Seared Foie Gras. I love that we can still get this in Arizona as opposed to it being outlawed in California which kinda makes it even cooler. If you've never had Foie Gras before, the best way I can describe it is telling you to imagine that fatty part of a really good ribeye that is a little crispy, but soft and juicy. This was the best Foie Gras I've ever had. Admittedly, I don't have THAT much experience with it, but I have to imagine this is one of the best you can get in AZ, also given that most places don't serve it.  The only reason this visit wasn't a 5-star review was because the service was lacking, BUT they were apologetic. They messed up a couple of our orders by bringing out the wrong dishes so it messed with the "perfect timing" that the server told us about at the beginning which is why they ask that you order everything all at once. The server said that it must've been an issue with the front of the house.  All in all, highly recommended. Dress is "Resort Wear" so jeans are acceptable, but would recommend at least a polo.  Of the fancier restaurants we've been two in the past couple years, this one falls top 2. Up there with Peter Luger and Gramercy Tavern.

My wife told me this farmers market has been here for a very long time and her grandmother used to take her on Saturdays. I've been twice now and really enjoy it. I think I'll become a regular at the very least to pick up a loaf of Noble bread (it makes me very happy that they're there) and then grab a couple breakfast burritos from Gil's.   Only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because I just wish it was bigger. It would probably not take you 30 minutes max to take your time and walk the whole thing and that includes stopping to look at all the vendors.   Hope to see this bigger one day. I'm always supportive of more events in north Phoenix.

Short: Get the Spicy Tuna Roll and for some reason I order entirely too many Gyoza orders but that explains why I'm fat.   Longer: Wild Tunas was another case of me going to a restaurant when it first opened and being disappointed likely because they're still figuring it out but coming back to give it another chance and loving it. I'm bummed I waited years to come back but it's probably safe to say we are legitimately "regulars" here now. We've been known to come 4 times in a week which is a lot for us at least. Service is great. It's a family operation and Tyler and Yom are genuinely nice dudes. It's awesome when there aren't many people there because you can have great conversation with them. That said, it's been getting really busy lately and they could probably use some more help but they do their best!  So onto the food, it's good solid sushi. We usually get the basics but the basics are quality. The salmon sashimi is fresh. The Spicy Tuna is simple and deliciously spicy. The Dynamite is top notch too.   All around good stuff! I'd have to save the 5 stars for a place like Nobu, but Wild Tuna is nothing to scoff at! I just don't want it to get too popular because or go-to nice spot when we want to eat well but stay in Moon valley.

Man, these bean burritos are so good. I've been a fan of America's since they opened their original spot which is now closed. Just went there with my wife this weekend and their service was excellent. I don't actually typically recall service being a noteable benefit of eating there, but this one visit in particular was very pleasant. Keep it up guys!  Must gets for me are: Bean Burrito, Breakfast Burrito and a Quesadilla. And a huge Fanta.

Short Version: French-Mexican. Same guys from Zinc Bistro. Hip and trendy if not a little too "hoity-toity" depending on the people working. Get the Pork Shoulder Tacos and start with the Guacamole. On the expensive side for Mexican food, but it's worth it and more than just typical.  Long Version: This place is always a safe bet and it's one of my go-to places when people ask me for recommendations. This is how you make Mexican food unique. The food served always exudes freshness and unique culinary expertise. The must-have for us are the Pork Shoulder Tacos which are perfectly tender and juicy, The Tableside Guacamole which has the perfect kick and zest, and the White Bean Puree which has the perfect texture and flavor.  Now on to the service. We've been here probably 12 times total and always had great service but the last time I went, the service left something to be desired. I came with one of my best friends who is well connected in the restaurant scene and if it wasn't for him, we would've left. We got there on a Sunday night off-peak time with visible empty tables and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. I understand this can happen when they're holding tables for reservations, but one hostess in particular was very smug and snooty about the whole thing. Just as we decided we'd go somewhere else, my buddy saw his friend working and talked to him about getting us in. He happily obliged and got us a table within 10 minutes and continued to take very good care of us throughout the night. Perhaps this is a normal rule in the restaurant OR the hostess was just upset we bypassed her smug attitude and got in anyways, but when I asked her for an extra menu she curtly told me that she didn't have any and told me I have to take my hat off. So, just a bit of warning, even though we're in Arizona where flip flops are pretty much excepted everywhere, don't wear a hat to this restaurant even though it's also a Mexican restaurant, but it IS a higher-end one so there's that.   Also, don't ask that hostess for a menu. She's incapable of keeping track of the one thing she's responsible for; menus. Good to have friends with connections though!

Second time using them now and they were just as open, honest and informative as the last time. I fully expected a much bigger expense, but Jorge (one of the owners) provided me with the options I had and told me what he'd do if it was his house. And believe it or not, his suggestion wasn't the most expensive one.  Flores Air really know their stuff and they know that at the core of a good brand is a good product and great service. If you have those things, you've got good word of mouth on your side.  He just finished replacing my capacitor and we just spent a good 20-30 minutes just talking about honest business and life in general. That's how much I like this guy! I'd go on a road trip with this guy. That's the type of good people you want in your home when it comes to strangers and service people.   Jorge tells me he never gets on the computer, but if one of his family members reads this, please let him and Miguel know they're good people. Not just good professionals.

Short Version: Get the Carne Asada Burrito. The creamy white rice is awesome too.  Long Version: I came here when Revo Burrito first opened as long time fans of Delux so I figured it would be good. I was super disappointed and never returned. That was probably 4 or 5 years ago. Not sure when they opened.   That said, I came back years later at the advice of a co-worker to get a Carne Asada Burrito and I must say it was pretty damn good. I was so against this place for all those years. You'd think I'd learn by now to let restaurants work out the kinks before I make a judgement call.  I got the Carne Asada Burrito with medium salsa in the burrito with a side of white rice and beans (comes with the meal) as well as a Mango Lemonade. The lemonade was pretty sweet so I'd tone it down a bit if I could. The Carne Asada was very tasty though. It had great seasoning and was very juicy. It looked small upon first review but I was pretty stuffed by the end of the meal in combination with the rice and beans. The white rice I got was really creamy and decadent. I'd highly recommend the combo I got.  I will definitely be back but not sure if I'll be able to sway myself from getting the Carne Asada Burrito again.

Short Version: Awesome, friendly and personal service. Great food. I enjoy the Egg Rolls or the Banh Xeo for an appetizer and the Pho Tai as an entree.  Long Version: We've been coming to Viet Kitchen pretty much since it opened and have always enjoyed coming back. The owner gets to know you and calls you by name. There's something very charming when you experience a restaurant that does that.  The Eggs Rolls are fried perfectly crisp with the center soft. The come out piping hot so give it a minute before you bite in.   The Banh Xeo is a real treat to get because when it's made at home, someone (usually mom and the sisters) have to stand by the stove the whole time making them. They're essentially Vietnamese Crepes with pork and shrimp and some bean sprouts in the middle and then folded. It comes with mung bean, but I'm not a fan of it, so I usually have them leave it out. I also take out the bean sprouts because many times there will be too many and it takes away from the flavor.   The Pho, which is a Vietnamese staple is probably an 8/10, so still very good, and more than satisfying for being so close to where we live, but there is definitely better out there. You just end up sacrificing cleanliness and atmosphere for it. So for that alone, it bumps the taste up to a 9/10 since you're not scared of touching anything.  The restaurant is very clean and well maintained and much more "Americanized" in that sense since most Vietnamese restaurants are dumps. They paid very careful attention to the design details importing decorations from Vietnam, so the owner spent a lot of time making sure the place looked authentic but also clean and tidy.  I highly recommend this place!

Bummer update. One of the things that made this a worthwhile Vietnamese restaurant besides the close proximity was the service. I had probably gone here once a week for a while and was a definite regular. I've now updated my review with two stars based solely on the food alone. There aren't that many Vietnamese restaurants that are California caliber in AZ and I always appreciated that Viet Kitchen at least had great service. The last time I was there, though, I had come 30-45 minutes before close and I was greeted with a rude "we are closing soon" so I just turned around and walked out and haven't been back since. I'm bummed. Maybe one day I'll go back but that quite frankly shocked me since they were typically so nice and we are such frequent diners. They may have lost a long term frequent diner forever.

Short version: If you can help it, go to another Paradise Bakery.  Long version: Of all the Paradise Bakeries I've been to this one is consistently the worst but it's the closest to home. Had my heart set on a Chicken Walnut Sandwich tonight but the guy said "we are out of molasses bread" and just stared at me. No apologies. Just stood there and looked annoyed at me for picking a sandwich they didn't have the bread for. My bad bro. Admittedly I don't come here for the service but common courtesy would be nice.   We get catering for our monthly meetings at the one at Biltmore all the time and they seem to be better.

Short Version: Great friendly service. Kinda random location. Tasty and unique burgers. We got the Beach House (pretty plain), The Special (tasty), Burger Brûlée (best of the three). Also got the French Toast Fries (unique and tastes just as it sounds)  Long version: it was our first time here and it was kind of difficult to find the place because the sign wasn't lit up. It's also not in the best area of town but it definitely adds character to the place. We were immediately greeted by a friendly guy. He knew all about the menu and happily helped us with our order making suggestions for us. Great service. I got the special (11/11/13) which was ham, patty in an English muffin with a tasty sauce. It was definitely unique and tasty. It reminded me of a breakfast sandwich. It looked small but the burgers are all filling. My wife got the Beach House which was simple and rather plain compared to the others. My friend got the Burger Brûlée which was our favorite of the three. I'm a sucker for burgers with eggs though. Lastly we got the French toast fries which tastes exactly as it's described. It's very state fair-y as a friend perfectly described it. I didn't know if it would work but it absolutely does. However, I'd suggest only ordering one and sharing since it's rich. I would imagine I'd get sick of it if I tried to go it alone. "It's dangerous to go alone!" - Old Man in Zelda telling Link not to order his own French Toast Fries. It was a pivotal point in the game.

Short: Get the Mushroom Burger  Longer: Man, that mushroom burger is so damn good. Been there 3 times now and haven't been able to try anything else because I keep craving that burger. I'm also a sucker for truffle and it's got some truffle oil in there. It's an overall juicy burger too. Definitely a fan of this place. Service is what you would expect at a fast food restaurant. I guess this might be borderline fast casual though since they bring you your burger.  I'm a big garlic fan, but don't like rosemary at all so keep that in mind if you're like me and consider skipping their specialty smash fries. The regular ones are good and crisp.

When this restaurant first opened my wife and I were fans and since we were moving back to Moon Valley we were excited that MV was going to get a new good restaurant since there aren't many.  We got the Carolina Burger and the garlic knot bun was a great idea. The burger was juicy and delicious. The truffle fries were the perfect side for it as well. Anything truffle I'm a sucker for.  Last night we went again after a few months and it seems they forgot the butter and garlic on the buns and the truffle on the fries. The burger was pretty dry due to the dry bun and lack of any garlic and butter so it was just a knot bun really.   Not sure if it was a bad night, but if I truly hope they pick up the quality again because I want them to succeed here.  I'll give it one more shot and if it's good again, I'll be happy to update this review with 5 stars that I would've given it a few months ago when I first ate here.

Staff is nice, friendly and knowledgeable. Ask for Zach at the bar. He'll dominate your taste buds with some delicious drinks. He's also a really friendly and helpful guy. Peter Rabbit was the best.  Once you're done with your drinks, order some Brussels Sprouts. I'm not actually a big fan of Brussels Sprouts, but they flavor these things to perfection. Calamari is thick and juicy. From what I'm told, they don't use the tentacles, they only use the real meat which is why it's so thick and tender.   For entrees you can't go wrong with any of the meat. Next time I'm going to try the Ribeye although it's a little spendy at 75 bones. But you get what you pay for and I'm a Peter Luger loyalist so I'm willing to pay for a solid steak.  End it off with the red velvet cake and the donuts. Red velvet cake isn't the thick, creamy and rich type that makes you feel fat. It's light, fluffy but still packed with the same amount of flavor. The donuts are soft and warm on the inside and comes with a dip. Awesome.

Shorter version: Good service. Good food. A little on the spendy side especially for lunch. Get the drunk bread with prosciutto. Looks terrible but tastes awesome.   Longer version: Came here for lunch with some work people. We had a reservation since there were 8 of us. I got the wild mushroom pasta and it was tasty. They definitely didn't cheap out on the mushrooms. It had a hint of truffle flavor and it was creamy. Maybe inly slightly too heavy. But I was actually full from shoveling the drunk bread into my gullet as the 7 others stared at me. Id literally go there and just order two and make it my entree. At least, if it wasn't so looked down upon, I would. I might anyways. I'll let you know how it goes.   Anyways, service was solid. Can't remember if they've done this in my previous visits, but they gave us desserts on the house at the end and said it was for the first timers in our group.

Short Version: Awesome. JUST like being in Hawaii. Got the Dragon Blood, Hawaiian Punch and POG with Sour Spray, Ice Cream on bottom and Extra Snow Cap.   Long Version: I debated between 4 stars and 5 stars here because of the really long wait and The ONLY reason this didn't get 4 stars is because the owners are SUPER apologetic and accommodating. Granted, it was busy and there is only one person making the shave ice so it's understandable.  This place is a testament to exactly what solid, friendly service will do for a business. Patrons won't turn pissy for a long wait as long as the owners/employees acknowledge that there is a long wait, apologize and are friendly. So often do we go to restaurants now where the staff is pretentious and make you feel like you're lucky to be there (See: My "The Mission" Review).   My nephew got little samples from the owner and shave ice maker in between him making it for other people. It's the little thoughtful things like that that keep customers happy and loyal.  You get to pick 3 flavors for your shave ice and optional additions are ice cream on the bottom and snow cap on top as well as a sour spray. The sour spray is pretty sour, so beware. We love sour so it was perfect. I love snow cap so I asked for extra. I wasn't disappointed. I just need to bring my own condensed milk next time.  I'd come back in a heartbeat.

Short version: good food, mediocre service, in a Walmart parking lot???  Not as short version: this place has a cool hip vibe on the inside that rivals restaurants in Scottsdale. It's a welcome change to this area but I can't get over the oddly placed location. It's located right next to a Walmart. That doesn't bother me so much as it worries me that they're not hitting the right demographic but that's the marketing person in me. I had some pork shoulder and it was tender and juicy. Had some baked potatoes and those were good too.   I'd say its a little more on the expensive side but nothing unexpected for the atmosphere. Besides you can walk to Walmart and save money there!

I had Jason Schumacher (owner) come in and give my kitchen an update. I made initial contact and he arranged to come by the house on my schedule for him to assess the remodel we had in mind. Very professional and insightful. He even saved me money by telling me he didn't think I needed to redo my cabinets which would've been more in his pocket at the end of the day. We did granite countertops and island as well as a full backsplash in granite. He needed to fabricate one of the cabinets to attach a microwave I didn't have there previously. He was done in a day and it was the most seamless project I have ever witnessed. I will be recommending him to anyone who is looking for a remodel. I can't wait for him to come back and do my next project.   You just get the strong feeling he is just trying to run a business built on honesty and the idea that helping the client will get him more business in the end and it's working because I've already referred a few friends to them.

Short Version: Awesome service. Great Thai Food. Get the Massaman Curry and the Spring Rolls. Also, get a Thai Tea.  Long Version: I came here with my wife, sister, brother-in-law and nephew not knowing that they were closing up. At that moment the owner came out and insisted that we come in. After some back and forth we decided to take them up on their offer. This says a lot to me about their service. So often you run into situations where you feel rushed by the wait staff so this was a nice change. We felt guilty but they kept insisting that they were going to be around for another hour anyways.  The restaurant does in fact have two sisters running it in the kitchen. They do a great job because we thoroughly enjoyed our Massaman Curry, Thai Fried Rice and Egg Rolls. All of it was delicious. We are pretty avid Thai Food eaters and we've yet to find a solid one by our place in Cave Creek/Moon Valley Area. We're glad to report that we have found that place. For a long time we were stuck with Pete's Thai which was awesome the first time we had it, but after 3 or 4 more times of ordering the same thing but getting completely different results, we've since given up.  Two Sisters does the 1 to 10 spice level like many Thai Restaurants do and they seem to have it down pretty well. As in 5 is medium and 7-10 are pretty spicy. I like mine around 6 or 7. If you're unsure, they'll happily give you some extra peppers so you can spice it up further to your discretion.  We've been back 2 more times so far and still love it! I hope the neighborhood supports them!

This place was great! We actually were hesitant to come for a very long time because my sister said she wasn't a fan at all. On a whim my wife and I decided to give it a shot and really enjoyed it!  We came on a Saturday night around 8pm. It was full but since we were just two, we sat at the bar which has full service. The bartender who helped us was very nice and helpful. He made some suggestions for us but wasn't pushy about it. My wife ordered a "Hey Bartender" which is a custom drink based on your preferences which the bartender asked her about. It was tasty. I ordered their house grapefruit soda. Also awesome and refreshing!   For appetizers we ordered the shrimp and chive dumplings as well as the pig face dumplings. The shrimp and chive were our favorite of the two but the pig face was definitely unique and tasty as well.   For dinner we ordered the Pork Ramen to split. This is where I could see where my sister thought it was salty. However, I like salty so I'm not a good gauge. My wife really enjoyed it as well and said she'd rather it be slightly salty than bland.   Overall a great experience! We will be back for sure.

Ask for Zach! Best service at a bar I've ever had. Also, this bar has legitimately good food.   Get the pork belly.   Get the solero.   Check out the back of the menu to help you choose. It has a really cool scatter chart to help. I'm kind of a data geek so I thought it was awesome. Maybe the next iteration could be a bubble chart to add a 3rd dimension! Maybe the size of the bubble could be the popularity of the drink! Oooo Zach, get on that idea!

Came on a Friday night and it turns out it was only the second night open. Service was great.   Got the crispy cheese curds which were delicious. Highly recommended. Definitely a highlight.   For the main course we got a Margherita pizza and the fat boy pizza. Margherita, while intended to be a simple pie, was a little too simple and borderline bland.   The Fat Boy Pizza on the other hand was very flavorful. The pickled peppers had us a little worried at first but it turned out to be the ingredient that made it so tasty!  Ended with the swirl soft serve to go with lucky charms. Great treat to end dinner with.   I'd definitely come back for the handcrafted thin pizza!

Very cool experience. I won't say too much about it, but we had an excellent time. We also escaped so take that into account. If we had lost, it might have been a total bummer.  We did The Apartment and had a party of 10 which is the way I would go. Otherwise, I believe they'd match you up with other people if you don't have a full party.  Would be a GREAT team building experience especially for a corporate event. Make sure you pick the right people to go with you though! Collaborative people are best and not ones who are control freaks. It's about teamwork and communication!
