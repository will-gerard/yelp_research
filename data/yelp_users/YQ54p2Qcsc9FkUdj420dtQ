Great place! Stopped here on a whim with a friend from out of town and really enjoyed it. The food was fantastic and the service was even better! Definitely go to this place if you're in the area:)

AJs sure is fine about messing up orders. We couldn't do a home cooked thanksgiving meal at our house because our oven was broken so we had AJs cater it. We explained to a Miss Teresa that we needed a cooked meal and she said she understood. We went to pick it up and we get cold uncooked dishes and a vacuum sealed turkey. We called AJs and the manager said that they couldn't get ahold of her so the best they could do is have us drive the food all the way back to the store to cook it with our hungry guests waiting at our house. The worst part is, the manager was very unapologetic about it. Thank you AJs for your lack of competence and poor customer service. Happy thanksgiving.

Not bad but definitely not great for the price and wait. The waitresses are nice but very inattentive. The dragon roll at happy hour had burnt eel and the sea bass took over 25 minutes to come out. Not worth my time nor my money.

Cheap quality and poor costumer service. My friend got his cabinets done through them and it is not worth it! Save your time and sanity.

A lot of reviewers are complaining about the service, but there I have zero complaints. The food is good, especially the BBQ! Really good quality meat, although a little pricey, but definitely worth it. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some good korean BBQ.

This place is AMAZING. Whether you do the lunch buffet or order by plate, you'll love what you get. No matter what though, you must try the mango with sticky rice. It's perfect!
