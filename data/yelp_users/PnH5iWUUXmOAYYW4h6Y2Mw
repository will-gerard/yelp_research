Love it here!  The bruschetta is amazing! The only thing is the lack of parking and the long waits but I guess more people feel like me. It's worth the wait. Just be sure to have cash on you because they do have valet.

I'm rating the turkey burger. First off I think their price of $5.10 is definitely worth the 1/3 lb of turkey burger you get. Every time I receive my order I forget how large this is. I almost have to save some for later. I've also had their garlic fries. They warn you that they are a little on the heavy side and I appreciate that but personally I prefer the onion rings if I do decide on adding a side to my burger. I've had their shakes which are extremely good but one of my favorite aspects of this place is the service and personality. I love feeling welcomed every time I go. Today I ordered my lunch by phone and when I arrived to pick it up with no wait they had my order ready and the cashier happily announced that " Yay, Jayme is here for her burger." I think the only negative thing I have is the parking. The parking lot is crazy small so when you go during lunch or dinner time it can be a little tough to find a spot without blocking someone in or circling around for a little bit. Thank you guys for your service and good food with a smile! Can't wait till my next visit!

Came in for lunch yesterday and order and bean and cheese burrito. Food was good and so was the service at the bar. You even get free chips and salsa thrown in with your meal when you take out. Definitely a quick place to grab lunch and head back into the office.

Food was great! Service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. So disappointed.   I went here with my friends last night for HH. I've been to RA before but tonight I had my $20 gift certificate for my half bday. I love this! I used this last year and couldn't wait to do it again. The Vegas roll is amazing! Now to the service. I initally sat inside but when my friends arrived we went out to the patio. The male server who brought me my drink inside was great! When we went outside and had a new server everything went down hill. First the server only brought us 1 menu for a table of 3 people. We had to ask for the HH menu and she dropped it down and walked away. When we ordered I asked if she could leave the HH menu there in case we wanted to order more drinks and she got an attitude with me (wasn't the first time) and told me she needed to make room on the table so she took it from me. I've noticed that the last couple of times I go to RA they leave the wasbi off of the sushi plates and I have to request for it when i receive my rolls. I had to do this last night and she again responded with an attitude and walked away. She never asked if we wanted refills. She was upset when I was trying to explain who was going to pay what with our cards. She came back with our cards she handed my check to me and mispronounced my name purposely (it's Jaime) so...  gave her my gift certificate and it seemed like the total owed was off she ignored us when we tried to call her over. She looked straight at us and kept walking. I just paid and left. I have no clue why she was in such a bad attitude but it's ashamed because I love the food and she made our experience horrible. Never going back there again and I'm going to vocalize our experience to my friends (at least not at that location).

5 stars for taste and portion! I've always loved Fuddruckers because of their customization. I can make it my own. It's been a while since I've been and because of my past experiences with wait time and not having one close to home I don't frequent too often. Today I dropped by for a pick up during my lunch break and I was happy to find out they take orders via phone. That was really helpful! As soon as I got there my food was ready. I only got the turkey burger but as soon as I took my first bite I was tempted for sides. This burger screams add a shake and fries. Though Fuddruckers is a little expensive for a single burger for nearly $9 it's totally worth it. There's no way you can walk away and still be hungry. Wish you guys would open a location close to Avondale!

Called early this morning at 8am to schedule an appointment for an oil change. The man who answered the phone explained to me that they don't take same day appointments but I could come in at 3pm because they were pretty slow. I got there at 3 and he told me that it would be 3 hours to get my oil change if I wanted to come back and pick my car up. I was totally fine with that. While he started putting me in the system I was texting my husband to come pick me up so I didn't have to sit in the hot waiting room while being 8.5 months pregnant. The man asked me what I was doing on my phone or something close to what are you about to show me on your phone. It was a little rude and off putting. I said nothing but I do have a Groupon if you need to see it. Then he said no we don't accept those if you're a walk in you have to make an appointment. Hahaha what? I said I spoke to you this morning and you said I could make one. Then he said you can make one now for the future if you want to use it because we only accept a certain amount of Groupons per a day. I said no that's okay. I'd rather take my business somewhere else before coming here again. I hate companies that like to get you in the door with these Yelp and Groupons but feel hurt and become rude when you try to use them. I hardly doubt they reached their limit on a Tuesday but who knows. They like to make up their own rules as they go along.

Me and my husband went here last Saturday for an early dinner. There was a short wait of about 15-20 minutes not that big of a deal since you could eat peanuts out of the barrel. We were seated and the service my our waitress was pleasant and fast. My husband ordered a chicken salad and I ordered the 6oz sirloin well done. When our food arrived his salad was fine but when I cut into my steak it was red. No slightly pinkish brown but the whole middle was red. I kindly asked the server if they could take it back and provide me a steak well done. She assured me that she told the kitchen the right thing so it wasn't that she made a mistake. So I kept my potato and nibbled on that while I waited for my steak to come back. Minutes later and my potato finished my steak comes pretty black and shriveled with the same piece I had cut off and examined. Here's my thing... I believe when something leaves the kitchen that it should NEVER return and then be placed back on the grill. When we politely addressed the issue of obtaining a new steak the cook took it back with a tiny bit of resistance after trying to explain that it was fine to just eat the steak. Once my new steak came out it looked amazing. It wasn't blacken for it to be well done and it was juicy. I was taken back a little when the manager came out to deliver it and when we explain to him our concern about placing food back on the grill he just stated that they ask and do that sometimes when people don't want to wait for another one to be cooked. We were never asked and I told him that. He never once apologizes for the mistake made and didn't seem concerned at all. Maybe I am making a big deal out of this but I could have touched the steak with my hands or couched, sneezed, or licked what have you.... And then it would have been thrown back on the grill with everyone else's food who was eating that night. Turns my stomach and I wish that the customer service was better for the manager to take some responsibility and ownership. Oh and in case you were wondering we payed for the full meal and we won't be going back to this location anymore.

Love Chino! I am a really picky eater and don't do a lot of whole in the wall spots but Chino is by far one of my favorite chill spots to eat. I usually order to go though. I love the quesadilla, jerk chicken (or jerk fried rice), and black beans.

Just went in a purchased a 6inch tuna melt with two cookies. Before I even get out of the parking lot I found a very long strand of black hair ties within my sandwich and wrapped around the bottom. My husband went in to get a refund. They acted like they could care less. They didn't know how to refund and so that took a couple of minutes and then threatened not to refund the cookies LIKE WHY WOULD I WANT TO EAT ANYTHING FROM HERE. GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. They finally gave him the refund after laughing among themselves and speaking in Spanish. No apology at all. Never coming here again. Would not recommend this to anyone.

Found the business on yelp and called to get my dogs nails trimmed. They said they could do it without an appointment so I was happy to drop my dog off before church. Even with him just getting his nails done they agreed to keep him until I got out. Once I got there I decided to do the spa. I had mentioned that I usually use a shampoo that was hypoallergenic and they said they had that option. I deceived exactly how I wanted him cut and when I came to pick him up he was so super soft!!! I don't know what they used on him but he looked great. Girls and counter and they girl who trimmed Lucky had great personalities and were very friendly and knowledgable. I only wish I had remembered to mention the free spa treatment with my wash that I found on yelp. Three thumbs up. I'd definitely drop Lucky off again.

Great food and drinks on happy hour. I got the Pad Thai and veggie egg rolls. Both were great and the dinner portions are large enough to take home as an extra meal. I am also allergic to msg and find it hard to eat at some establishments. No msg here. Will definitely go again!

This was my first time at True Foods. I got the turkey burger and it came with half side of kale salad and half sweet potatoes (recommended by our server). Didn't really care too much for the burger it was just a little blain for me but the bun was good and so were the sides. I don't even eat kale and it was great. Super fresh and had maybe olive oil and pramasan drizzled on it. Oh I also asked our sever for some hot tea and she offered some lemon, honey, ginger tea. LOVED IT! This was a risk for me because I don't like the taste of ginger but it was masked by the honey lemon goodness. Sorry I'm not sure if the name of the tea. I'll definitely come again and see if I have any better luck with another entrée and most likely pick up some tea even if I'm just in the neighborhood.

I love Luci's!!! Get their Hot Juan Black Bean Burger. It's the best I've ever had. Also try their sweet tots to at least once in place of their tator tots. So good YUM!

They got rid of their sweet tots :( this makes me so sad. It was the icing on the cake. I'm sure I'll be back for my hot Juan burger but there is a little hesitation because I don't really love their other side choices.

I am black with natural curly hair. It's been hard to find someone I trust to manage my hair and listen to what I want. Then I found Niza. He did a wonderful job on my hair. I got a deep condition, my bangs and hair trimmed. My hair lasted for several days with Niza recommendations and felt super soft. He also finger curled my hair. Would definitely recommend him to any natural curly girls.

Grabbed dinner here last night. The service was great. The second girl in rotation gave me an option of adding my sauce as a side because it wouldn't fit on my steak bowl and before we left they offered us free tortillas. I had no idea those were free but yes we happily accepted. The food tasted well and fresh. I usually get the veggie bowl so I'm not use to having so much meat and I didn't realize that the steak had a little bit of a kick to it (probably not a problem for most). Two thumbs up. We'll be back.

If it were a year ago I would have given a 5 star rating for the work. A handy man came out to do several different jobs in one day. He was efficient. He also gave me a quote for items in the house we wanted to get done. Eli then came out a couple days later to quote the same items (slightly higher price than original). I was fine with that because I trusted their work. A year later when I wanted to get one of the items done; a ceiling fan installed, I emailed Patricia who I guess handles the appointments and asked for a new current price for the same item. I was okay that the prices were going to increase. I figured they would after a year but for her to even give me a quote she said to do that they would charge $75 just to come to look at the room that needed to have the fan installed for me to even obtain a quote. Why would I do that for a room you've already sent someone to see twice? We live ways out but last time she said since we were having multiple services they wouldn't charge that. I asked if when they sent someone could they do multiple services the same day to wave the fee. She decided not to honor. I guess they have enough customers that they don't need my multiple jobs in a day to make a trip out.

Great serving sizes and very tasty food. I love the Pad Thai here. I can't eat MSG so I'm always looking for a convenient Thai restaurant that is nearby. I only gave it four stars because I've never sat in or have much interaction with the staff to rate customer service.

Love Chick fil a! It's probably the only fast food restaurant that I frequent at because of the fade AND customer service. I've never left a chick fil a without being satisfied. This one in particular has won me over because they'll add my French vanilla creamer in my coffee before serving it to me and because whether my dog is with me or not they'll give me a treat for my little lucky. Great customer service and great food!

Good stuff first - The room was amazing! I want to give it 5 stars just for the room. My husband and I stayed here the night of our wedding and we loved the panoramic windows, soaking tub, and rainfall shower. The hotel also left us a nice fruit and cheese tray in our room for when we arrived.   Not so great items - While we were waiting to check in and I was still in my wedding gown with our luggage in hand we had trouble at the front desk because my father was the one who booked it for us and the clerk was explain to us how he should be with us because it was his card.... Really I'm standing in my large wedding gown on my wedding night and you want to explain to us that there is difficult letting us have a key because the cards under my dad's name even though the room is under mine. That was finally settled after about 15 minutes. Then we ordered breakfast in the morning which detailed an order of 1 pancake and coffee with a side of sausage. They handed us a bill for $60! Afterwards when we left we had to pay for parking so we did so on our card and they still billed my father $25-30 for parking anyway. I had to go back and forth with the manager to get the charge reversed finally.   Would I stay again- Sure because it'll be on my card but I would make sure to go out to eat.

Love this place and I've tried several things here and they are all great. Love the chicken wrap, veggie wrap, pancakes, and salads. There aren't many places I can stare for minutes at the menu because of all my options. That's saying a lot because I'm picky. Never had a bad experience here either.

Love this place. I definitely think we get more bang for our buck during hh than date night but I love that they have different options during the week for deals. My favorite is the pesto pizza but I could live off their fries with aolie!   Only downside is their options of mixed drinks. I've gotten three different martinis off their menu before and they aren't worth the price. Now I know just to get a glass of wine or their sangria is pretty good. Highly recommended!

Jackpot! Me and my husband just ate here and loved it. Small hole in the wall place with great food. There servings are big and fair for the price and the food tasted amazing and hot. I got the ox tail which came with rice and beans, plantains, and cabbage. My husband ordered the same sides but with goat. Goat is extra spicy but totally worth it. We've been to 4 other Jamaica spots in the valley and other than the one in Chandler (which is a crazy drive) this one is the best hands down. Service up front was okay but the women prepping the food, who I presume to be Ester was friendly. Oh and we also grabbed a pattie to go for later. Haven't tried that yet but I know it's fresh because they didn't have any ready until after we finished eating 25 minutes later.   I also want to note that most Carribean places run out of certain foods quickly especially on Saturday. I love that everyone on the menu was stocked and ready to go. We will definitely be coming back here soon. Highly recommended.

Wanted to like this place and it's gotten so many great reviews I was excited about trying it out. This review is pretty old I haven't been here in probably eight months. I ordered the jerk chicken and plantains. Even though it was during a weekday they were out of patties. Unfortunately the plantains tasted old and/or heated up too long they stuck to my teeth. Way too mushy sweet. The jerk chicken was OK but it didn't taste like it had jerk seasoning on it. It reminded me more of a  hot barbecue sauce then a run. Unfortunately I probably won't be trying this plays out again as there are other places nearby that sell Caribbean food for the same price or less for a larger quantity. Maybe I came on and off today it was right after the lunch rush.

Me and my husband decided to try this place for lunch today. We had just left trader joes and were looking for a quick bite to eat. We walked in to check their menu and were hooked after seeing the wood fire oven and the smell of the pizza. We shared the Margherita pizza. First I want to say I was very pleased that our sever knew that all of their cheeses were pasteurized. Most franchises we go to have no clue what I mean when I ask. Secondly, I loved that they served the bread and oil before our meal pizza came out. Third, the pizza tasted sooo fresh. We loved the mozzarella cheese and my husband didn't hesitate to grab my end crust before I put it down on my plate. Highly recommended.

I'm only giving this 2 stars because the first time I went there the owner, China did my hair. I just went natural and came in for a wash and trim. She was wonderful and the price was great. She took care of my hair and I didn't feel like she was trying to up charge me or scare me into coming there every other week to be able to grown my hair and she gave some great advice. The next time I went which was this past summer I was scheduled with another stylist. If I were to rate this review only on this past experience I'd give it only 1 star. Not only did I arrive and the shop was not open yet but I waited in front for at least 10 minutes until people started showing up and then I sat for another 10 until my stylist decided to show up. I came in for the same thing as last time. A trim and wash. I saw that I could get a conditioner for $15 more on the wall so I decided to add that. My total should have been $30 I believe and when I got to the register they asked for $50. I said for what I just got a trim and wash and conditioner. Well they explained something weird to me like the conditioner is only an add for that price and so they had to charge me separately for the trim, and shampoo which isn't listed or at least wasn't at that time, and then also for the conditioner. Long story short they gave allowed me to pay for what i was original quoted but said next time I should know better. Also I left with my hair very dry and they cut my hair dry (China did it while it was still wet and asked me before which was I wore my hair the most to make that decision) and all she did for the styling that came with that basic treat was one french braid. I doubt that I'll be going there again anytime soon.

Love this place. They have so many options on their menu it's hard to choose so I have to keep coming back to try new things. The last time I got the lox which was amazing. It comes with fruit and a small salad. I've had the pancakes and nachos too and they all meet expectations. Only thing I didn't like is the turkey sausage. It doesn't seem to have much taste. Kind of bland and over priced so I would get that again. Everything else including the atmosphere, outdoor seating, and service service was perfect. Definitely recommend and will go at least once or twice a month for brunch.

I scheduled an appointment here by an employee referral of someone I met at a restaurant. She told me she interned there and loved it and I was looking for a new vet so I figured it was a sign. I was wrong. They called me the day before with the wrong appointment time and even though I had an email confirmation the woman said I was wrong. I had to call back and ask for the guy who emailed me to straighten that out.   When I got there with my dog we waited 30 minutes in the front waiting room (no one else was there waiting either) just to be told that the flea meds we had been promised (whole reason we were there) were not there and the guy at the front shushed and said no one told him we needed it so they were ordered. So he suggested we still see the doctor and finally put us back in a room where we waited another 20 minutes. My husband had ask for a small dog treat or water to be say out. That never happened. I guess the front desk guy forgot. We finally walked out after bring there waiting for a hour. Would recommend this place at all.

I called today to get a quote and Eric was very knowledgable about the doors and installation options and explained it in a way that was easy to comprehend. He also gave me a peace of mind about the scary thoughts in having a pet door and having unwanted guest come in. Still deciding whether to get it installed or not but if I do i'd definitely schedule my appointment with All About Pet Doors.

Kaard Bombe filmed our wedding last year (2014) in May. My husband is a videographer and asked before hand if we could just have the footage at a discounted price for my husband to edit. He turned in the footage and it was beautiful especially after my husband edited everything. I would have given him 5 stars if this were the end of the relationship. A couple months after our wedding Kaard asked if he could hire my husband as a contractor to edit a handful of wedding films. My husband edited about 5-7 wedding videos during the summer of 2014. At the end of the summer Kaard became unresponsive and didn't pay my husband for the work that he had put into the last two videos. We've never been able to get a hold of him sense or receive money for the videos. For this I would give a 0.  After reading the other reviews on here I want to tell all the brides who got married last summer to please reach out to me. If you didn't receive one of your wedding videos or footage there maybe a possibility that we have a copy of the edited video. Just because my husband edited the footage and turned it back into Kaard doesn't mean he turned it into you.

I was refereed to Safe Haven by my realtor when my husband and I were in escrow. We had mentioned to her that we were going to have ADT come and install with free installation and we'd receive a discount with our USAA membership. The woman who I worked with, Terri Carroll had told me that with Safe Haven we'd have free installation and a $100 gift card presented to us after installation. She had also informed me that we'd need to pay 2 months in advance when we had everything installed. Imagine my surprise when I received a bill from ADT asking me to pay for a bill for my first month and the installation just 30 day after we signed a 3 year contract (the contract term wasn't even mentioned until the tech came to set up). When I tried to call Terri and ask her why they were asking for my first month and installation she explained to me that the $100 gift card that we would receive was to cover the $107 installation fee but it was a rebate and we had to wait 2-3 months to receive that. Whether we decided to use that to reimburse ourselves or not was our option. If we had went with our first decision we would have received a discounted price per a month off the bat (which she had promised also but is now stating it won't come into effect until 3 months from now), free installation up front, and a security camera.   To top it off some weird man came to our door two days after we installed the system and asked if we had ADT (there is a sign in our yard) and asked how many doors and windows were secure and said he was just from Safe Haven and wanted to verify that we had our security and discounts. It seemed sketchy like he was scouting our home and didn't make sense that he wasn't in communication with his own company. I would never recommend this company to anyone. Stay away and work directly with ADT you'll feel more secure. I wish we had.

Me and my husband passed by Crave while leaving another restaurant and stopped by to check out their menu. Because we missed the past happy hour at our other spot we decided to sit down and grab a glass of wine (since it's half off on Thursday). Waffles were sooo good and the staff was very accommodating and nice. Overall we had a great experience here and will definitely be back for their breakfast option with their $12 bottomless mimosas Friday through Sunday!!!!

Locked the main door behind without the keys and needed someone to unlock the door. I'm 8 months pregnant and it's the middle of the summer in Arizona. RJ Locksmith was one out of three of the locksmith's I had called that had an affordable price along with a short waiting time. He was able to show up in less than 20 minutes where everyone else had quoted an hour and half. Highly recommended!

Came here with a coworker yesterday and their food is just as wonderful as their customer service. I got the chicken sandwich, some fries, and a Carmel shake. My friend set the expectation high with their chicken sandwich. She told me that it was better than chick fil a. I have to agree. It taste very fresh and crispy. The cashiers are quick and friendly even bough there was a long line. Appreciated someone coming over to clean our table and grab our trash when we were done eating. Place was nice and clean and has a hip style to it. Definitely recommended and will bring my husband along soon to try one of their famous burgers and another flavor shake.
