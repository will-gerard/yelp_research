Excellent Fried Snapper!  I had listened to a good friend talk about this place for years. Although he had eaten other things from their menu, he absolutely raved about the fried snapper whenever he had it.   Well, last week I was in the area, with time to kill before a meeting downtown, and a pretty good appetite. I decided it was the perfect time to try San Carlos Bay's snapper for myself.  I was welcomed to sit anywhere I pleased, and was very shortly brought chips, salsa, water and a menu. The salsa was on the hot side, but delicious with the fresh taco chips. I ordered the whole (head included) fried red snapper (small - you have a choice of small, medium or large) which came with refried beans, rice, and a lime.  My food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and looked wonderful. The fish was still piping hot, and had been scored on both sides to ensure even cooking. What I loved about the preparation was that I ended up with so much nice crispy fish! It came away from the bone easily and I only had to be careful about the tiny bones along the fins.   My fish was un-breaded, nicely seasoned, and perfectly cooked. The "small" fish was the perfect size for me, and left me completely full. I didn't add any hot sauce or salt, but enjoyed eating the hot salsa with it, along with juice from the lime. The refried beans were good too. I've never been a fan of that red Mexican rice. I tasted it, but left it alone after that.  I completely enjoyed my meal, and also thought that it was appropriately priced. Service was friendly, and I intend to return the next time I need a fish fix.

Good Food, Lots of Choices, Overwhelming Menu...  First of all, I have to go back here again. There are so many things I want to try. Eating here did however require that I take considerable time to study the menu, and that I ask lots of questions.   When I was arrived shortly after they opened for lunch, I was seated quickly, and provided a menu and water. From the moment I was seated, every minute or two someone approached me to take my order. I finally explained that this was my first time and that I needed to be left alone for a bit. Mission accomplished. No one else approached until I put the menu down on the table and closed it.  I ordered hot tea, and from their Authentic Szechwan menu, C107 - Spinach in Garlic Sauce and C124 - Yangzhou Style Fried Rice with egg, shrimp, chicken, roasted pork and peas and carrots in a white sauce (not the usual dark colored fried rice).   My food didn't take long to be prepared, and was fresh and satisfying. The Spinach was perfectly seasoned and cooked. A nice mild dish with lots of garlic aroma and flavor in a lovely light sauce. The Yangzhou Style fried rice was not like any other fried rice I have had before, and if I hadn't read the description carefully and seen the picture, I would have been confused by it. The shrimp and the chicken in the dish were particularly delicate, moist and delicious and clearly cooked to order. The roast pork was chopped into roughly 1/4 inch cubes, and the rice was mildly flavored and had a sort of melt in your mouth texture. I needed to add a bit of soy sauce to the dish, along with a small amount of hot oil for bite, but I ate as much of it as I could. The leftovers of both dishes reheated well at home in the microwave (loosely covered).  At no point did I lack for service, with servers constantly checking back with me.  My only disappointment was that I could not try everything I wanted to, including items from the "Americanized" menu - such as Egg Foo Yung - which I didn't go for this time because I was a little disappointed that the ingredients (peas, carrots, meat, whatever) are all served over the patties in brown sauce rather than inside of the patties. Only onion and bean sprouts are cooked in the patties. When I go back again, I'm going to go for it and see how I like it. It was also a bit pricey, but now that I've experienced the equality of other menu items, I'll spring for it.  When I finished my meal and pushed my plates away, my check was brought immediately, along with take-out containers for my leftovers. The payment process went quickly, and soon I had my delicious left-overs in my car to smell all the way home.

Great Steamed Shrimp Dumplings!!! Great Service  When I arrived I was immediately seated. Kenny, my server, took care of me right away and was helpful and attentive throughout my meal, making sure of the quality of what I was served.  I LOVED the Shrimp Shumai (steamed shrimp dumplings). They were light and flavorful and served on top of a swirl of spicy Chinese mustard.    I wasn't so crazy about the texture of the Ramen noodles (seemed more like rice noodles), but that aside, my Cha-shu (Hakata with extra pork) was very tasty, and a generous portion.   I ordered the Korean Spicy Beef to go and it was delicious warmed for dinner later in the evening. It was mildly spicy and nicely seasoned.   Overall, I had a great experience. I'll be going back again, but skipping the ramen noodles next time. The prices seemed reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food.

My Absolute Favorite Calamari!"  The Calamari, and great Bar Service are what keeps me coming back to The Capital Grille year after year.  I have enjoyed dinners here as well, but the Pan-Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers is what I crave, along with the house made potato chips which are a crispy golden brown. Of course, I don't turn down the Stoli Doli, a martini of chilled Stolichnaya vodka infused with fresh pineapple served straight up. Not to have one would just seem wrong somehow.   I think I feel another Capital Grille jones coming on...

Not Worth the Drive for a Chicago Style Dog...  I had a craving for a serious Chicago Style Vienna Beef Hotdog. I searched for options on the internet, and read reviews for various places around town. Places way out in Mesa and Gilbert were an awful long haul for me, especially since one can never be sure how the reviews will actually stack up against the reality once you arrive and try the food. So I decided to make the relatively short drive over to the Chicago Hamburger Company.  I had my first Chicago Style Vienna Beef Hotdog in Chicago, back in about 1986. I love the "pop" when you bite into the hotdog, and the flavors of the relish, peppers, and other ingredients that make a Chicago Style Hotdog what it is - especially with Vienna Beef inside. I have repeated the experience in Chicago over the years, and when living in the Minnesota, I found great places to go to relive those experiences. Fast forward to Arizona.   I've had experiences that were close, but not quite there. I arrived at Chicago Hamburger Company hoping for the real deal.  Even as indicated in the ratings, this is not a place to go for pleasant ambiance. It is strictly you order food at the window, they make food, you take it with you, or sit at a fairly clean table to eat it. No frills, just hopefully, the taste you came to enjoy.  The menu was straightforward. There was no line, so I ordered my Chicago Style dog, and because they might be interesting, garlic fries. My food was brought to me pretty quickly at the table I had chosen by the front windows. I was glad I had gotten there when I did, because a line had formed, and was getting longer by the second.   The fries were loaded with garlic, which is a good thing, but the fries were so heavy and greasy that after eating two, I had to toss them. Good idea, but way too heavy.   My Chicago Style Dog had all of the right ingredients, including the poppy seed bun. The hot dog, however, lacked flavor and there was no "pop" biting into it. I'm guessing that the hot dog sat in hot water for too long, and that the flavors were leached out and the texture compromised. For all the great toppings, that Chicago Style Dog was a bust. I ate it, but the experience was disappointing.   They had a sign up proclaiming their home made milkshakes, so I decided to try one to overcome my disappointment. I ordered banana, and only had to wait a couple of moments for it. As I drank it on my way home, I thoroughly enjoyed it, although it didn't quite fill the void left by the disappointing Chicago Style Dog,  I'm going to guess they are called" the Chicago Hamburger Company", and not "The Chicago Style Hotdog Company" for a reason... Maybe one day I'll go try a burger - but not another hot dog.

Really Disappointing  I drove across town to eat here after reading the mostly positive reviews. I reviewed their menu before going there, and ordered based on some of the feedback I read.   I had called ahead in order to minimize my wait time for a table, and when I arrived, there were lots of people waiting to be seated. I was glad I had called. When I checked in, they said it would be about 10 minutes to be seated, so I decided to eat at the bar, which had plenty of room. I requested a class of club soda, and she brought it right away. I didn't realize she would ring it up as a sprite and charge me for it. I couldn't tell you the last time I was charged for club soda other than when in San Francisco. If I'd know, I would have just had water.  The bartender got back to me relatively quickly to take my order, especially given that she was serving the bar and several tables too. I ordered the 14 oz. Ft. Worth Rib Eye medium rare with sautéed mushrooms on the side, a side of corn, and a side of green beans. The bartender immediately brought me a basket of their rolls with cinnamon butter. The rolls were piping hot, and great with the cinnamon butter, but I was saving myself for my entrée so I stopped after sampling them.  My dinner came out fairly quickly, and luckily the bartender came over almost immediately to ask me how my food was. It was a good thing. They had served the steak smothered with the sautéed mushrooms rather than providing them on the side, and my steak was cooked medium well - way to done for me. I had thought I would be ok, because I had ordered according to their menu description of "doneness levels". I showed her where I had cut into the middle of my steak, and she agreed that it was way too done. She said she would take care of it and took it back to the kitchen. A short time later the service manager brought me a fresh dinner, with a medium rare steak (I checked it while the bartender watched), and the mushrooms in a dish on the side. The service manager indicated that she had made sure because they want their customers to be satisfied.  For the price, I can't complain about the steak, only that it didn't come out correct the first time, but it was on the salty side. Luckily, the mushrooms weren't salty at all, so they balanced each bite of my steak. It was a little on the tough side, but tasty, and I was hungry.  After a few bites of steak, I tried my sides of corn and green beans. The green beans I simply didn't like. There was some sort of tough meat in them that I don't think was bacon, but didn't recognize. They were also too salty to eat. I tried the corn, but it also was too salty to eat, and drowned in something that didn't taste like real butter to me. It was just salty corn in salty oily liquid. Of my entire meal, only my steak and sautéed mushrooms were edible. The steak wasn't good enough to earn a good rating for this overall experience.  After I ordered, my tab had been placed in a glass in front of me. When I was finished eating, I put my credit card in the glass and turned it so the bartender would see it. I probably sat there for 10 minutes before she noticed, and I could not get her attention because she was very busy at tables. It wasn't a problem because I wasn't in a hurry, and was reading a good book. She didn't even question that my side dishes were uneaten, and I didn't feel like complaining any more. I was just ready to go.  As I drove home after eating, one review I had read lodged in my thoughts. It was a poor rating from a diner who had been there several times and had hit and miss experiences. They said that when it was good, it was great, and when it was not it was terrible.  As I continued to think about the ratings I had read, there had been several about the how salty the food sometimes was. I guess I went on one of the days that the cook was heavy handed with the salt.  My experience wasn't terrible, but I think I went when the kitchen was having a bad day. It's too long a drive from my home to go back again. I would not recommend The Texas Roadhouse to friends.

Nice Spot to Gather and Enjoy Food and Wine  This friendly spot was worth the drive to meet, sip wine, and chat with a group of new and old friends. Service was fast and friendly, I enjoyed the wine offerings, and had a nice Caesar salad. My only concern was that my calamari came out barely warm and overly salty. It was perfectly fried, but apparently during that busy time they couldn't manage to get it to me still hot. If I lived closer I might be tempted to return to try the calamari under different circumstances. I didn't want to send it back that evening because they were so busy.

I discovered Houston'swhile in Atlanta on business in the 90's, and have been a great fan.  After I moved to Scottsdale in 1999, I became a serious regular and found Houston's to be a 5 star experience every time.  It was a great relationship until the changes started a few years ago.  First, their wonderful Filet disapppared for awhile, unimpressive sushi was introduced, then the Shashimi Tuna Salad disappeared, and the Phoenix location was rebranded as Hillstone.  (I ate at Hillstone twice and then gave up on it...corn on the caeser salad - a southwestern Shashimi Tuna Salad - really?)  But back to Scottsdale, where I have the most history and the strongest relationship.  They had wonderful staff who, even if I wasn't around for awhile, remembered my name and nearly all of my preferences.  Every one of them have recently left.  Service now is ok, but not great.  A high level of attentiveness is a thing of the past.   Of course, over the years the prices have increased but in the last few they have really been increasing, while portion sizes on items like salads, have dwindled.  Houston's has never been inexpensive, but I am happy to pay to have the food that I want.  Therein lies the rub.  My last two visits were so bad that I am determined not to go back.    My very favorite - the shashimi tuna salad - is history again.  Although the offered, if I wanted to pay the price of the $24 Flying Tuna Platter, to fix me something sort of like it, but not with the dressing or other elements that I loved.  I ordered fries, but they have lost their snap, and I had to pick little bits of fiber off of them.  The manager explained that they were burlap fibers from the bags that they use.  I didn't eat them, and was not charged for them.  I eat early, but can no longer get a baked potato at 2pm - and where did the pork chop go?  No more 1/2 glasses of wine.  So on my very last trip, not finding anything that we came for on the menu after 13 years of dining, my friend and I decided to go with the tortilla soup rather than just leaving.  It was far too salty...not something I have ever experienced at Houston's.  Of course, they did not charge us for the "meal".  No reason to ever go back now.  Leaving Houston's with an empty stomach, I considered stopping at Bandera, another Hillstone property.  I quickly wrote off that idea since they've tinkered with their menu items so much that I gave up my "regular" status there in 2010.    I believe that the Hillstone Restaurant Group has made some awful choices over the past few years, making changes to long time favorites that ruin the dining experience.  Perhaps new chefs can't just leave a good thing alone or need to put their stamp on it.  I saw this in another review and couldn't stat it better - "I understand menu changes happen but it was so good and so the same for so many years why do they have to switch it all up now? Pretty sure the business model was working just fine. "    As steep as Houston's prices have been over the years, I didn't mind paying for great food and great service.  I'll probably go in for a fillet a couple of times a year, but I'll have to wait until it's crowded at 5pm to have a baked potato with it.

I Used To Be A Regular...Never Again  I used to dine at this Houston's regularly beginning in about 1999. It was my absolute favorite place to eat on at least a weekly basis due to the excellence and consistency of its food and its staff. I nearly always ate at the lovely bar because of the attentiveness and great service from the bar staff. They knew who I was, knew what I drank, and always remembered how I liked my food prepared. It was well worth the price.  Then, a few years ago, the menu began to morph into something quite different. Sushi showed up. The Sashimi Tuna Salad disappeared and then reappeared in a modified fashion before disappearing again. The Sushi (which wasn't all that) went away. They changed the Filet preparation. The list goes on....   They began to fail in terms of general food preparation - overcooking some foods, forgetting ingredients, over-salting, food not as ordered, etc. - sometimes after multiple attempts. The staff also began to turn over, and new staff appeared apt to linger having long conversations while I, and others, had to work to catch their attention and be served. The staff still smiled, but friendly, attentive, "all about the customer" service ebbed remarkably.  Houston's lost its allure as their standards, menu, food and service deteriorated even as the prices continued upward. At the end of 2012 I stopped visiting Houston's for months at a time, and except for one decent visit in 2014, my experiences have been unsatisfactory.  Last week, craving French Dip and Fries, I decided to try one last time. It was a complete dining disaster. The fries were completely different that ANY I have ever eaten at Houston's. They were not thin, crisp, or even remotely golden in color. They were a thicker cut, limp, barely salted, tasteless, somewhat oily and unappetizing in appearance given their color and "bubbled" surfaces.   When I finally got my server's attention she told me that they had changed the potatoes and the cuts (like I couldn't see that). When I asked her why, she told me they always had, depending on where they were able to source them. She offered to bring me a different side, but I declined since I had an untouched French Dip in front of me which I was certain would be plenty for me to eat.  I turned to my French Dip, my mouth ready for a delightful treat, and I got a mouth full of mushy meat. As I chewed, I struggled to understand what was going on. I hadn't dipped my sandwich into the au jus yet so that wasn't it. I finally realized that I had just eaten a mouthful of fatty meat. An experience I have never had with Houston's French Dip in over 15 years, and never want to have again. At that point I was done. The taste in my mouth was awful.   A second server had appeared at the bar, noticed that I had pushed my plate away, and came over to me immediately to see what the problem was. I explained that the quality of the fries, and the fattiness of the French dip were not working for me. She quickly brought me a menu so that I could select something else to eat, and had the manager come over to assist me.  The manager very nicely informed me that she could request that the kitchen prepare me a French dip sandwich from a leaner part of the prime rib, as if I should have known to ask for a "lean" French dip sandwich when I'd ordered, when I'd never in 15 years had to do. Really? Just like I should have known to order "crisp" french fries when they had always been crisp before? I explained that the experience of that mush in my mouth had completely put me off of any urge for French Dip, and that I would find something different to order.  With most of my favorite items gone from the menu, and desperate to avoid anything fatty at that point, it took me a few minutes to settle on the Loup de Mer (grilled sea bass). It arrived quickly, and was well presented, but once I got past the edges of the fish, it was clear that it was undercooked. Most of the fish, beyond the surface, was translucent. I understand that this was probably sushi quality sea bass, but I didn't order sushi, or even seared sea bass. I could not eat raw fish.   Tired of returning food, I tried to make it look as if I had eaten some, covered it with my napkin, paid my tab, and began to consider where I would eat before going home.   I am only writing this much to illustrate why I had to give Houston's only one star. I would have given none if I could have. I'm also hoping that if someone who used to love going there reads this, they will either not bother, or go prepared for the changes that are in store for them. I'm done with Houston's, and for similar reasons, the rest of the Hillstone restaurants.

Good Food, Mixed Feelings...  Following a craving I've had for Lebanese Garlic Sauce, I ended up at Byblos for a much anticipated late lunch. I also brought along a printed coupon they had displayed on their web site.  I had called ahead to ensure that their garlic sauce wasn't the garlic mayonnaise mixture (yuk) I had been served at another restaurant in town as garlic sauce. The person who answered my call to Byblos assured me that there was no mayonnaise in their garlic sauce. I set out anticipating a nice mouthful of savory emulsified garlic, lemon juice and olive oil - or something approximating that - like I always used to be served in my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis.  I was seated and provided with water and a menu immediately. I arrived after the lunch rush was past so service was not a problem.   I was going to order the grilled chicken breast lunch plate, which was served with garlic dip, but the owner encouraged me to try the chef's special of the day instead. The special was spinach simmered with ground beef and spices and served with rice pilaf and hummus. It included a cup of their tomato soup. I also ordered garlic dip to go, and a glass of their yogurt drink.  My soup was brought almost immediately, and was absolutely delicious. I could eat that soup daily! My main course was not far behind. It was good, but left me wishing I had ordered something with punch to it. I was really glad I had ordered the yogurt drink as it gave my meal additional flavor dimension.  I was left wanting something additional, so I ordered the Honey Pudding for dessert. I really don't know how to describe it, but it was fabulous and wonderfully creamy!  I was feeling that I'd had a good experience overall, and before the check was brought I gave the server the coupon I had printed from their website. It read:  "$5.00 OFF Any Dining Experience of $20 or more. - Cannot be applied to the purchase of alcoholic beverages - Coupons may not be combined with any other offer - Not valid on Holidays or special events - Coupon void if altered - One coupon per party - Expires 07/31/2015"  The server took the coupon and a few minutes later, the owner came over and explained that the coupon was only good for dinner. Nothing on the coupon (above) or the website had indicated to me that it was for dinner only, and I had intentionally spent over $20 on food because $5 off seemed a good reason to do so. Of course, he was the owner so his interpretation prevailed. I didn't make a scene over it, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Finally, the much awaited garlic dip! I opened it at home a short while later. It smelled nice and garlicky, but was not at all what I was looking forward to. I don't know what it was made from, but it had a texture a bit thicker than hummus. It was sort of like dry garlicky mashed potatoes. There was apparently no lemon in it. I should have asked more questions. So, at this point my quest for garlic sauce remains unfulfilled.

Best Thai In The Valley!!  A friend of mine had been raving to me about this place for years. I finally visited it in April, and then again yesterday.   My April visit was a really nice experience. The servers was helpful with suggestions and explanations of the food. I couldn't recall my friends recommendations, but tried #26, Chicken (choice of meats) stir-fried with fresh chili peppers, onions and bamboo shoots, which I had mildly spicy. It was delicious, and I left with every intention of returning soon, however a car crashing into their building caused them to close down for several months. Bummer.  Well, I finally got back there armed with my friend's recommendations. My server was very familiar with my friend, and recited off to me as his favorites, the same recommendations he had given me. I took that as a good sign, and it was. This time I had #36 Eggplant stir-fried with chili, onions, carrots and mushrooms with chicken (choice of meats). We settled on medium heat this time, which is how the server told me that my friend orders it.  It was spectacular! I had never had Asian eggplant before! I have no idea exactly how they cooked the eggplant, but it was juicy and full of the flavor of the sauce. I found myself favoring it over all of the ingredients in the dish.   The sauce was savory with all sorts of notes that I couldn't identify, but loved. I believe it had a healthy dose of Thai basil, a nice bite, a wonderful rich body, and a wonderful dose of garlic. All of the ingredients combined so nicely, I nearly hurt myself trying to finish the entire dish. In the end, I had a healthy amount to take home for later.   Based on the heat of the dish, I decided that a scoop of coconut ice cream was in order. It too was delicious.   My server came back to my table often to chat and to check on my progress. It was one of the most delightful meals that I can recall. In addition to my left-overs, I took home an order of #15 Tohm Yahm Goong - a zesty hot and sour shrimp soup with lemon grass and fresh mushrooms.  I have eaten Thai at several locations in the valley, and this was by far the best. I already know what I am having on my next visit!!!

I've eaten at The Pita House on several occasions over the years. Each time I go back, I'm reminded why I haven't been back sooner. It isn't terrible, but it isn't very good either. The food I've had here has generally been bland. All the right ingredients are on the plate, but nothing stands out, and nothing brings those ingredients together.  This time I had the gyro salad. The meat was just ok. The lettuce was crisp. The dressing was just boring. I have never gotten the sense that anyone who works here cares.

Really Good Pizza & Service This Time! Great Improvement!  I am writing a second review of Grazie because I have now had a better experience than my first!  In my last review of Grazie, I had stopped in here in June on a day when the lone person working in the restaurant was juggling several indoor tables with a very large party outside on the patio. My experience at that time beyond having to wait for service, was that the pizza, while not bad, really needed to cook a bit more as it was a bit soggy in the center. It was understandable under the circumstances, and we felt bad for the lone server/chef, still, our experience in June was just ok.  My visit this weekend was because I was craving a really good thin crust pizza, and because Grazie came so close last time to hitting the mark. I decided to try it again, and hoped there were no large groups present...  Once again, there was only the lone server/chef working by himself, but thankfully this time, there was no group, and only a few tables of diners. I was seated and brought water immediately, (I picked a spot to sit where there were no air conditioning vents to cool my pizza faster than I could eat it - a problem on my last visit) and settled in to contemplate my order. The smell of pizza baking in the oven made my mouth water...  I decided on the Roma (kalamata olives, capers, and anchovies were calling me) with garlic added, and within minutes, the server came and took my order. My pizza didn't take long to come out, and it looked absolutely perfect. I prepared myself for the possibility of a soggy middle, but was thrilled to find that the bottom of the crust on my pizza was completely crisp!   There was a nice balance of sauce, mozzarella, and toppings so that the pizza wasn't overloaded or too skimpy. There was lots of flavor in each bite, and the crust was so good that I even ate all of the edges.   While I had to take half of the pizza home, I found that evening that it heated up perfectly crisp on a rack in my toaster oven.  I plan to go back again soon - this time for the Marcello or the Marinara since I'm trying to avoid meat (for now). I think a salad would be in order as well!

Best Breakfasts Ever!!  I couldn't help myself and stopped in twice last week, and I actually tried a couple of items I'd never ordered before. Seating was no problem either morning since I arrived not long after they opened.  The first day I was craving veggies, so I ordered an omelette with spinach and cheese. It arrived piping hot, and it was HUGE. It was very fluffy and loaded with lots of fresh spinach just as I was hoping. It was served with a side of their delicious pancakes, although I hardly had room to do eat more than a few bites of them.  The second time I'd had buttermilk pancakes on my mind, and Original Pancake House definitely has the best, so I decided to go there again. They had bacon pancakes and blueberry pancakes on the menu, so I compromised and ordered a short stack of blueberry bacon pancakes to satisfy both my savory and sweet cravings. The combination was awesome, and I almost managed to finish them.  I have never been disappointed at Original Pancake House. I think I'll go again this week and try the Swedish pancakes...

I have been wearing glasses since childhood, and consequently have utilized a variety of Optometrists, Opticians and optical shops over time.  Eyecare Plus is the BEST I have experienced in Arizona.    - Their eyewear selection has been perfect for me, and they go out of their way to assist me in finding me exactly the frames and lenses that I need at the most reasonable price possible. - Dr. Kessler it first rate, knowledgeable, and abreast of new developments.  He has provided valuable expertise relative to my vision concerns for several years now. - The Eyecare Plus team is friendly, knowledgeable, VERY accommodating and easy to work with.    There is no better experience than dealing with a business you look forward to visiting.

Reached home with my order and it was the opposite of what I requested.  Called them and they simply told me that I ordered wrong.  I paid good money for something I could not eat.  Since when is chicken and a bowl full of white rice Teryaki Lite...  Ok, no time to go back - as they were not going to make it right anyway.  Tried to eat it... Chicken was dry as cardboard, and rice was a sticky mess.  Never again.  Save your money.

I went for a late lunch because Buca sent me an email coupon for a free small pasta dish. I was hungry and had an hour to spare so I stopped in. The service was very friendly, and a server came to take my order very quickly. She was knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful in the ordering process. What threw me off was when she indicated that my order should only take about 5 minutes (for baked ziti). About 20 minutes later when I was able to get her attention (she was working alone and several tables had filled up) she indicated that she would bring my food right out. What I anticipated as a small plate of baked ziti was enough to feed a family. I ate what I could, but took home two take-out containers full of pasta. Summary, portion sizes are huge, service is friendly, but slow when they get busy. Food was just ok.

Great Ambiance, Inconsistent Food...  I've visited The Carlsbad Tavern off and on over the years, and I REALLY want to be able to like it unconditionally. The drinks are good, I LOVE the ambiance, and the service, while varied, is generally good. This is a great place to have a drink or two and just enjoy being where you are.   My challenge here has always been the food. I won't refer back to past food disappointments, but once again on my last visit during a busy happy hour, the meat in my Angus Beef Filet Mignon Tacos was dry, and in some instances hard.   No matter how great the atmosphere, even if I'm getting happy hour priced food, basic quality standards should be in place.

Great Improvement! Great Food, Great Service, Good Happy Hour!  I'm really glad I gave this place another few tries!  The Carlsbad Beef Brochettes were wonderful, except that I would request next time that they not be prepared well done. The portion was huge - enough for two - and I loved the dipping sauces. The prickly pear margarita was delicious! Even better, everything was on Happy Hour prices!  I've had less than great experiences here in the past, but whatever was causing the issues has clearly been handled. We also loved the Filet Quesadilla which we had on a visit a few days earlier.

i've really tried to like RA over the years because it is so conveniently located, but they never quite measure up.  If you are looking for traditional preparations, this is not the place to go.     A simple example - I was there the other day and ordered a spicy tuna roll, and a  spicy salmon roll.  The happy hour prices were great, but the rolls were VERY heavy on the rice (which wasn't quite done) and not spicy at all.  The spicy salmon had a bit of flavor but I don't really care for preparations such as RA's which use mayonnaise.  The spicy tuna was bland in the extreme, and was simply a chewing exercise.  When I mentioned the blandness of the rolls to the sushi chef, he indicated that the management had recently changed the spicy tuna recipe from one that was spicier, but which had also contained cilantro - which I would not have cared for in my roll.     Reminds me why I stopped eating here before....

Economical but only so-so sushi...  I had tried Kyoto years ago and found it pretty disappointing in terms of sushi quality, but since it has remained open, I decided to give it another try in case I had simply had a poor initial experience.  I have now tried it twice in two weeks, and it still is a generally disappointing experience. While the lunch menu prices are great, the sashimi quality remains off. The first week it just tasted bland, and the second week is was bland, overly wet and spongy in texture to the point that I was slightly nervous about eating it.  Both times I had the Sashimi lunch special which is nicely priced. Each time, my miso soup was barely warm, and not very flavorful.  The first week I also had a spicy tuna hand roll, which was substantial in size, but totally lacking flavor and spice. The tuna preparation was generally incorrect.  Service was just ok, and both times my server failed to check back with me after delivering my food to be sure it was ok.   Perhaps the cooked dishes are a better choice.

Off My List For Good  This is a place I either used to go to, or order take-out from several times a month for years. I loved that if I didn't feel like getting dressed to go out, I could drive up and they would bring my food right to my car - so yes, convenience was a factor.  It is still convenient, but for the value, the prices have gotten awfully high over the years.   Many of the items that I came to love on the menu have been modified to the point of not hitting the mark with me anymore, or have been removed. When I ask about the modified items, I am told that they have not been changed, but I've been dining there longer than most of their staff has been working there. I have tried newly added items over time, but I just don't care for them, not limited to, but especially the fried items. They are all way too heavy.  Maybe I'm a throw back, but I would like to have the same Macho Salad, with the same dressing that I enjoyed in 2001. I would like to see house smoked salmon on the menu all of the time. It is on the menu of all of the other 4 Banderas across the country, why not here? I really miss the grilled lamb sirloin.  To give them credit, the rotisserie chicken is wonderful. At least they haven't changed that, and at least they have stopped serving it in that awful puddle of tortilla sauce which you had to remember ask them to leave off the plate once they started serving it that way.  Between their prices, unpleasantly shifting menu, and the absence of my favorites, I give up. Although service is ok, I want to go somewhere where they have food I can enjoy.

Seriously Great Food!  Dining at Razz's is a one of a kind experience, especially if you dine at the bar where you can watch Razz prepare the food. The food itself is delicious and elegant and his preparations are always interesting. I think that I need to get back there soon! It is always a treat!

I wasn't surprized, I was shocked.  Forget the Egg Foo Young!  I've ordered from China Wok a couple of times before, and was never impressed.  I should have given it up!  I just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money.  To give them credit, the food arrived more quickly than the 45-60 minute widow they indicated, and was piping hot.  The Egg Foo Young however was the WORST I have ever tasted.  Now, I am not a food snob, but I have been eating Egg Foo Young since my childhood, and eaten it at many places as well as prepared at home.  I've had it good, I've had it greasy, and I've had it soggy, but I've never had anything even remotely resembling what I got today.    I opened the box and based on what I beheld, thought I'd received the wrong meal.  The egg foo young patties themselves, at first glance, looked like uniformly round batter fried eggplant slices.  I cut, with difficulty, into one of the patties (it was tough) and the inside looked like a meat patty - nothing egg colored or even remotely yellow about it.  The color was like a well done hamburger - gray.  I tasted it and it certainly didn't tase like Egg Foo Young, nor did it taste good.  It was like a bite of a dense veggie patty.  Awful.  I checked all three patties and they were the same, and inedible as far as I was concerned.  So on the chance that they had sent me the wrong order, I called the restaurant and told them I thought I had the wrong order.  She verified that the right thing had been sent.  I said "but this seems like a tough meat pattie of some sort.  I've never seen Egg Foo Young like this."  Her response was "that is how we prepare Egg Foo Young".  So, word of warning - that is how they prepare Egg Foo Young.  Order something else, or just stay away completely.  In my experiences with Cina Wok, you can never be quite sure what you are going to get.  This was just bad enough that I HAD to write a review.  I wish there were zero stars.

Go for the food and the value, not for the ambiance...  I have been longing for a decent Chinese restaurant close to home. I had driven past New China Gate many times, but it just didn't look like much so I didn't give it much thought.   Yesterday, really craving Chinese, I finally took time to read reviews about New China Gate from 3 different sources. While there were lots of digs about other aspects of New China Gate, the reviews of the food were generally good. Thank goodness those reviewers were generally specific.  In particular, reviews of their Garlic Chicken intrigued me. My taste was for something not too heavy, and not breaded or fried - but with lots of flavor. The Garlic Chicken reviews made me get in my car and drive to New China Gate.  I arrived around 5:00 unsure what to expect, and concerned that they might be really busy. There were plenty of tables available, and I was invited to sit where I wanted by a very friendly woman who was working there. I sat at a table at the front, where I could face out the front window rather than staring at the other diners. She brought me a menu and water right away. I asked her for a few minutes to consider the menu.  Looking around, the place was pretty drab, dreary and loud. Lots of conversations, cell phone and in person, filled the air, with nothing to absorb all of the sound. Ambience was, as the reviews had warned me, not on the menu. There was nothing even pleasant about the setting other than the smell of good food. It was VERY "divey" in every imaginable way. I started to get a little nervous about my choice.  When my server returned, I asked what vegetables were cooked with the Garlic Chicken, she indicated zucchini, onions, garlic, mushrooms, green peppers, and water chestnuts.   I absolutely DETEST zucchini, and when I asked her if they could substitute broccoli for it, she quickly agreed that they would be very happy to do that. She was very careful to indicate "no zucchini" on the order in addition to requesting the broccoli. I can not tell you how much I appreciated that attention to detail. I didn't even want to see zucchini - I won't tell you the story that goes with that... but knowing I wouldn't have to look at or smell it made my server my favorite person on the planet for a few minutes.   I asked her if I could get my dish made with white meat. She explained that for quality reasons, they use nothing but white meat for the dish, which also made me very happy. Finally, I asked for hot tea to complete my order.  I sat back to read my book and wait. It wasn't long before my place setting, and a dish of steamed white rice arrived, and right behind it, a delightful smelling and generous dish of Garlic Chicken.   It was in a light, flavorful, aromatic sauce with ample amounts of thickly sliced chicken, broccoli, green peppers, mushrooms, onions, garlic and lots of water chestnuts. Everything was perfectly done! The onions were in nice sized pieces and still had a nice, but not overpowering bite to them.. The broccoli, mushrooms and green peppers were still a little crisp, but cooked enough to have absorbed the flavors of the sauce. The water chestnuts brought a nice crunch but flavorful presence to the dish.   I spooned rice and garlic chicken onto my plate, added a touch of soy sauce, and lost myself in mouthful after mouthful of savory delight. (I am not exaggerating here - I was in Chinese food heaven.) I completely forgot about the setting, and the noise of other diners conversations and just ate for as long as I could.   I finally had to surrender to the fact that I was going to take the other half of my dinner home. perhaps for lunch the next day. I emerged from my haze of food enjoyment to realize that I never got my hot tea. I also realized that my server had never returned to check on me, or anything. Luckily, everything had been perfect, so no problems there. So, I waited, and waited. Eventually, my server reappeared with my check, and a take out container. I supposed I could have looked for her, but no big deal.  I was pleased to see that I wasn't charged for the tea that I never got. It would have been good with my food, but I was so pleased with the meal that I couldn't bring myself to even mention it. There was also no charge for the change from zucchini to broccoli, which many other places would have decided to profit from. The dish was actually a great value for the quality and quantity I received.  I left feeling satisfied with having just consumed an excellent Chinese meal. I'm glad I took to heart the reviews of the food, and didn't let the ambience throw me off the scent. This was an experience I will be repeating. I think I'll try their delivery as well.

I hadn't been here for awhile, and so decided to go for lunch to take advantage of the lunch specials.  I was immediately greeted with a smile, seated at a pleasant table, and provided a menu. After a very short wait, my server came to take my beverage order.  She returned very shortly with my iced Yekemem Shai (tea with cinnamon, cardamom & coves), and took my lunch order.   I ordered the sampler from the lunch menu, and selected Doro Wat with boiled egg (spicy chicken stew), Gomen (collard greens), Fosolia (string beans and carrots) as my three items.  I also ordered the Tikl Gomen (cabbage, potatoes and carrots), and some Ayeb (home made mild crumbly cheese) to sprinkle on top.  There was an option for rice, injera or both - but I stuck with just injera.  I had never had this sort of iced tea before, but as I started sipping, I was really glad that I had ordered it.  It had a lovely perfumed aroma and flavor but was not overpowering.  The café  had a pleasant ambiance which I enjoyed while I was waiting for my food.  As I waited, the restaurant around me filled fairly quickly, and I was glad that I had arrived when I did.  It looked like there was also a lot of take out activity going on.  Shortly my food arrived, and it looked and smelled delicious.  I forgot about taking a picture until the Doro Wat, my stand out favorite, was completely consumed.  Everything looked and tasted fresh and was nicely seasoned.  The portions were more generous than I expected.  The injera was very nicely made, and not as sour as I have sometimes had it.  The Ayeb was interesting, but I will pass on it next time as it was very mild and didn't really add much flavor.  I was provided refills for my tea, as well as a fresh cup to take with me.  Service was friendly and attentive throughout my visit.  I left wondering why I had waited so long to come back here.   This was the first of 2 Ethiopian restaurants I ate at in two days, and this was by far the best!

I really wanted to like my lunch at Philly's. A friend of mine had been there the evening before, and while he wasn't wowed by his Philadelphia Cheese Steak, he indicated that he would go back and order it again. I suppose that was enough to get me to try it...  I showed up fairly early for lunch, and decided to sit at the bar since it wasn't very crowded. A very friendly bar tender/sever greeted me (Mary B), provided me with a menu and water with lemon. She made me feel totally welcome.  After giving me the few minutes I had requested to review the menu, she returned and offered to answer any questions I might have. I settled on an 8" Cheesesteak with grilled onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, cherry peppers and provolone. Since she indicated that the cherry peppers weren't hot, I requested some jalapenos on the side. As a side dish I opted to have the side Caesar salad from among the options that she provided.  My food didn't take long. The salad looked good, and the sandwich arrived piping hot. Unfortunately, the Caesar salad dressing tasted more like green goddess dressing, and was bland and rather heavy. The lettuce was nice and crisp and fresh, but the dressing made the salad such an unpleasant experience that I didn't eat it beyond the first taste. I had really thought I'd enjoy the salad, so I was a bit let down.  My cheesesteak was ok. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really good either. Adding the jalapenos to it gave it some additional flavor, but I think that a heavier helping of grilled onions may have helped. The sandwich bun was great, but the steak and veggies in the sandwich hadn't browned or caramelized at all, and while moist, my sandwich lacked any depth of flavor.   All in all, my cheesesteak was filling, but not very satisfying. My lunch overall, was just so-so.  Service was great, so I think I'll go back at some point in the future to see if perhaps they just had a bad day in the kitchen.

"Wonderful Crispy Crust!!!"  Based on a recommendation I stopped in at Otto's for pizza today. I arrived just as they opened and there were no other customers at that point. The young lady behind the counter greeted me with a smile as I entered. I could see Otto behind her by the oven, and was glad he was making my pizza today. There is no table service, so you order at the counter. I placed my order to eat there, and picked a table to sit at.   My half Otto's Veggie and half Otto Philly pizza was brought to me fairly quickly, and it looked delicious! The toppings looked fresh, it was piping hot, and the pizza crust around the edges looked puffy, crisp and light. I decided to start with the Otto's Veggie side of the pizza.  The crust was light and crisp and thin - even at the center of the pizza! I don't recall ever having a crust like it. It was delicious! Beyond the crust, the balance of toppings was perfect, and the flavor was wonderful. When I finally ate my way to the puffy crispy crust at the edge, it was marvelous. That's the part I don't usually eat, but this was so good that I had to eat it. The Otto's Philly side of the pizza was just as good as the Veggie side, with a nice balance of toppings.   By the time I was having my third slice, I noticed that there was a line of customers from the counter all the way back to the door. I had been so absorbed with my pizza that I hadn't noticed them. It was a good move to arrive when they first opened because there are only a few tables, and most everyone was eating there rather than ordering to go.   With only Otto and one counter person working, I had to wait until everyone in line had placed their orders to be able to ask for a box to take the rest of my pizza with me. I think that the next time I'll ask to have it served in the box so that when I'm ready to leave, I'm all set and don't have to wait.  All in all, I had a great lunch. I'd like to try some of the other items on the menu.

Extremely Disappointing Experience, Especially Compared to their Town & Country Location...  I arrived at Pizzeria Bianco downtown Phoenix on Adams St. prepared for a repeat of my wonderful dining experience a week earlier at their Town & Country location on 20th St. That was not to happen...  I arrived early, just as they opened, since this location has a reputation for being very busy, and long waits to get in. By the time I left, 30 minutes later, the place was packed. Arriving when they open is apparently a sound strategy for getting seated.  I had so enjoyed my Pizza Margherita at the other location, that I was certain I would have a similar experience here. Even though the staff was busy with seating back to back arrivals at the front door, my seat at the bar proved to be a good idea as a server came to bring me water, and take my order almost immediately.   The pizza offerings here were the same as at the Town & Country location, so once again I ordered the Pizza Margherita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil) with the addition of garlic and prosciutto, understanding that prosciutto would significantly increase the cost of my pizza. As at Town & Country, I was assured that additional ingredients would not interfere with the crust being thin and crisp. I considered ordering a glass of red wine, but my server never returned, or came within "hailing" distance.  My pizza was brought to me by a different server after a very short wait. It didn't look quite as perfect as my pizza from the Town & Country location because this pizza had many burned areas on the edges of the crust. Before trying it, I had to cut through the prosciutto, which was apparently added after the pizza was sliced.  My bite of the first slice was not quite what I had expected or hoped for. The crust was super thin, but not quite crisp at the center as it had been at Town & Country. It was also barely warm - not even close to hot. I wondered if once it came from the oven, it had to sit and wait for someone to have time to finish it with the prosciutto and basil.   Finally reaching the edge of that first piece, it became clear to me that unlike at Town & Country, this WAS going to be one of those pizzas where part of the crust would be left on the plate - the burned part. I tried a bit of it, but it wasn't slightly charred, it was burned through on most of the edges.   Since no one came back to check on how my pizza tasted (all attention was focused on the stream of incoming diners) I made my way through a couple more cool slices, eating less and less of each slice as the burned edge was increasingly large as I worked my way around the pizza. It had turned into a pretty poor experience.  As I looked up, I saw that my check had been left for me - no offer of dessert - nothing - just an apparent indication that I should pay and relinquish my check. I got my credit card out, and placed it with the check. When the server came to get the check, he did ask if I wanted a box - but I had NO interest in taking that pizza home with me.   I would have preferred focus on the pizza preparation and service, rather than how quickly they can seat people as they walk in the door. The door seemed to be all that the staff was attentive to. This ended up being like a pizza cafeteria rather than a pizza dining experience.   My experience at Pizzeria Bianco, the original at 623 Adams in Phoenix was a complete and very expensive bust. It was a complete waste of money for a poorly executed pizza, poor service, and poor value. I would not recommend it, and will not return. I will, however, be returning to their location at Town & Country again soon.  As an aside, looking at the photos on Yelp for both locations, I see more pictures of burned crust for 623 Adams than for Town and Country.

Good Turkey Burger, Excellent Fries, Pricey But High Quality Ingredients  I went here last week on the sincere recommendation of a friend who loves turkey burgers (doesn't eat beef or pork). Of course, I tried the turkey burger.   I arrived after the lunch hour, so the restaurant was not crowded. I was immediately seated provided a menu, and offered a beverage. Service remained excellent throughout my visit.   The menu offered many attractive options, but since my mind was already made up, I ordered the Turkey Burger. As an afterthought, I also ordered a half order of regular fries (they also offer sweet potato), which my friend had said were delicious.   Fairly quickly, my server brought me my fries, and told me that my turkey burger would be up shortly. This would have been a problem if I had wanted the fries in tandem with my burger. Here is a tip - if you want burger and fries together, tell them when you order. I noticed that the other diners also received their fries prior to their entrees - like an appetizer. I was hungry, and didn't mind the delivery of the fries first. They were hot, thin, very crisp, perfectly lightly salted, sprinkled with parsley, and served with amazing catsup and delicious spicy aioli for dipping. Yum. These are a must have.  At about the perfect moment, my Turkey Burger arrived. All-natural, extra-lean ground turkey breast served on a toasted wheat bun with red leaf lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and sides of pico de gallo and fat free garlic & cilantro aioli. Per my friend's recommendation, I added the sides to my turkey burger. The only problem with this burger was that it was too thick (even with squeezing) to get into my mouth for a complete bite of everything. I did my best, but I really hope that no one was watching me. I would have liked my turkey burger a touch less lean, but the sides, avocado and tomatoes added moisture and fat that was much needed.  The portions were generous, and had I not been so hungry, I'm sure that I would have taken half of my burger home. As it ended up, I abandoned half of the bun. I didn't notice initially, but I could have had a lettuce wrap instead of the bun. That is what I will do next time.   Yes, next time. There are great burger, salad, and sandwich options, in addition to sushi after 4pm, and daily soup specials.   This was not an inexpensive place to dine, but the quality and service were worth it. For their burgers, they use Niman Ranch beef and other high quality ingredients. They also have a full bar, and extensive beer and drink menu. Seating was tight, so I will likely go back during their off peak hours again.

My visit was a complete disappoinment.  I drove all the way from Scottsdale because I had heard such good things about Matt's, so I arrived hungry, and with high expectations.    The restaurant was busy, with only counter seating available, so I took one of the available stools.  They are VERY uncomfortable metal stools.  The seats are round, unupolstered, metal, smaller than most folks butts (I am a small woman), insufficiently contoured, and very slippery. I had to pull the stool in close to the counter, wedge my knees against the counter, and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if I would slide off.  The hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that I kept looking around in to see if a table opened up.  So, uncomfortably perched, I decided to try the pork chop, eggs, hashbrowns and wheat toast.  The plated food looked good.  The eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter, I couldn't get enought salt without opening the shaker, and though I am not a heavy salter, everything needed salt.  The pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry, overcooked, difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided, and tasteless (seriously),   I could see that the meat was seasoned, but I couldn't tast whatever they used.  I didn't understand the texture of the hash browns.  The top and bottom were crisp and pretty good, but the middle (which comprised most of the order) was really wet.  Hungry as I was, I ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns, a little of the pork chop, a couple bites of toast, and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one (I can't handle eggs alone).  No big breakfast at Matt's for me.  I was too disappointed to even complain about my meal.  I just paid my check and left for the treck back to Scottsdale with no plan to ever return to Matt's.

I was craving a Philly Cheese Steak today and so after considering the reviews of a number of restaurants offering them. I decided that Corleone's was the best bet for a real Philadelphia style cheese steak near my zip code.   Because it is a chain, I arrived slightly skeptical, and ready to have a less than wonderful experience, in spite of the positive ratings. Thank goodness the positive reviews were accurate!  I arrived barely ahead of the lunch crowd. At least 15 people crowded in right behind me, which I took for a good sign. I ordered the small rib eye steak sandwich "wit" (with) grilled onions, grilled peppers & mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. I skipped the cheese wiz because my memory of Philly cheese steaks in Philly and NY as I was growing up had NO association what-so-ever with cheese wiz. The young man who took my order was very helpful with my order, and my eventual cheese choice of mozzarella over provolone.  (Mozzarella melts better he said, and he was right!)  My sandwich was completely cooked to order. There was no partially cooked steak sitting to the side of a grill waiting to be warmed and served - this was cooked fresh! The onions, mushrooms and green peppers were also perfectly grilled, and combined with the meat and mozzarella cheese were perfect! The bun initially had a bit of crunch, so I think that the inside was grilled or toasted.  All in all, it was a delicious sandwich. The meat was nicely cooked and the sandwich was nice and juicy and perfectly seasoned. I added a combination of the hot cherry peppers and a few sweet cherry peppers from the condiment bar to my sandwich to make each bite just right. The cheese was perfectly hot and melted, creating delicious strands of cheese from the sandwich to my mouth. Once I started eating, I could not put the sandwich down. It was REALLY good. FAR better than I would have expected from a Philly Cheese Steak in Arizona...  I didn't try any of the sides, but the pizza did look really good. I think it will be a while however, before I have anything but the cheese steak - just like I had it today!  For a small cheese steak and a small drink, my tab was nine dollars and change, but it was worth every penny!

I returned to Pita Jungle at their suggestion given my prior review, and had a better experience than my prior two visits, and for the first time I actually enjoyed my food.  I didn't bother to try items that I didn't like the last times I had them there.   This time I had the Chicken Combo Platter, which was apparently a better choice than on my prior visits.  The chicken was moist and delicious, I really liked the mixed beans, and the dish overall was nicely balanced.   Service was as great as ever, and this remains a good place to stop in for a healthy meal at a good price.

First of all, kudos to Bobby Q's staff. Absolutely EVERYONE was super friendly and attentive. I was waited on in some way by at least 5 different members of their team, at least 1 of whom I believe was the manager. Everyone smiled and made eye contact, and they all seemed genuinely concerned that my needs were being met, and that I was getting what I wanted. I was immediately greeted with a smile when I walked in, and smiled at the entire time I was there. I really did experience 5 star service.  The ambiance was casual, rustic, and interesting in its own way.   The bartender came right over (you guessed it - with a big smile) and when I indicated that I had not been in before, she immediately explained about the lunch menu and the various options in just enough detail. She left me to fill my drink order while I considered my choices.   I decided on the Platter Sampler, which allowed me to choose three kinds of meat, a side and cornbread. I figured that this would give me a chance to check out more than 1 item. Of the sides, the roasted corn was the most appealing to my tastes. I also ordered their shoestring fries. I don't have the capacity to consume large amounts of food, but with that long a drive, I wanted to try lots of things, even if I couldn't finish them.  A few minutes later, I overheard a couple of gentlemen at the end of the bar ordering meatloaf. Wondering how I had overlooked that, I studied the menu some more, but didn't see meatloaf anywhere. When I asked, the bartender indicated that they periodically have off menu specials. Since I had come so far, I ordered the meatloaf (only $9.99) to go.  My food came out very quickly, and there was a lot of it. Portion sizes were generous. I had opted for a combination of Brisket, St. Louis Ribs, and Spicy Smoked Link Sausage.   The roasted corn was not corn on the cob, although the dish was topped off with two slices from the end of a roasted ear of corn. The off the cob corn had kernels that looked like they had seen fire. The juice that the corn was in had a good solid smokey flavor to it. I had anticipated and would have preferred roasted corn on the cob. To my personal tastes, it wasn't great, but it also wasn't bad.  The shoestring fries were perfectly cooked, thinly cut, skin on, and nicely salted. It was a HUGE order that came out in a little pail. I could have made a whole lunch out of the fries alone! I hardly put a dent in them.  Turning to my platter of meat, I was somewhat disappointed overall.   There were several slices of brisket. It was extremely moist, almost mushy as if it had been cooked in liquid, and there was no smoke ring. I've lived and eaten all over the country, including Texas and the Carolinas. I have had good smoked brisket, and this bore no resemblance. It was more like pot roast or meat you would find in stew, with no smokey flavor. In fact, the corn had more smokey flavor than my brisket. I would not order the brisket again because I think this must just be the way they have decided to prepare it. Maybe lots of people love it. Maybe they've never had better. I didn't like it.  The sliced link sausage was missing the usual coarse texture of sausage, with the textures of fat and lean. The mouth feel was as if it has been boiled, or in liquid at a sufficient heat to cook the fat out of it. That left the texture sort of like moist cardboard. The flavor coming through wasn't bad, but the effect was like nicely seasoned boiled cardboard. (It took me the entire drive home to figure out a truthful way to describe it.) Perhaps this batch had just been sitting in warm moisture too long. I'm going to go back and read through the reviews again to see if I'm the only one who experienced this.  The St. Louis Ribs saved the day for the meats. Except for being a bit fatty, and a general lack of smokey flavor, they weren't bad. Not great, but not bad.  The good news was my take-out meatloaf special. I swear my portion of meatloaf was nearly 2 pounds! It was also tasty! It wasn't what I expected as it had more pungently savory ingredients than I am accustomed to in meatloaf, including a degree of heat, although not excessive. It was topped with a generous portion of golden fried onions, and accompanied by a huge serving of skin on mashed red potatoes! The only downside for me was the gravy, which I am grateful came in a separate container on the side. I'm not a fan of tarragon or thyme or whatever it was loaded with. Lots of people at the bar were eating it, but I didn't notice whether or not they used/ate the gravy. Simply a matter of preference I guess.  Please consider this review with a grain of salt. I've traveled and eaten extensively, but I'm not a critic. I just know what I like. You may love what Bobby Q's has to offer. The only thing that I am really sold on is the wonderful customer service. I'll also throw in that they appear to have lots of regulars, and that lunch appeared to be a bustling affair with no lack of diners.

OMG, their Italian Hoagie is to die for!!!  I went here with my guy to pass some time on Tuesday during their lunch hour.  We shared the Italian Hoagie, and he had a spicy enchilada soup which he was so busy eating that he didn't even slow down to talk.  He was still finishing his soup as I ate the last of my Hoagie.  Let me tell you, I was seriously eying his untouched half I had enjoyed mine so much.  The Italian Hoagie was on a delicious, perfectly crusty roll, with Genoa salami, pepperoni, cured ham, provolone, giardiniera, peppers, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo and Italian dressing. When ordering, I was tempted to omit the mayo (which I don't generally eat), but I followed my gut and decided to have the hoagie just the way they usually prepare it.  I was so glad that I did.  Taking a bite into the crisp roll, my mouth was then filled with delicious meat and cheese, spicy savory toppings and the juiciness of the mayo and tangy Italian dressing.  It was love at first bite for me.  Next time I'm having a whole hoagie of my own!  We sat at the bar, and service was very friendly and very efficient, and they seemed to be constantly available.  The ambiance was pleasant, and since they weren't too busy during my visit, the noise level was not a factor.  This is a trip across town for me, but I will absolutely be making the trip again soon.  It may be awhile until I get past the Hoagie to try something else on the menu!!!

Good Food, Great Friendly Service  I just stopped in at the store at Scottsdale Rd and Shea. I had never been to a Jason's deli before and was completely baffled and overwhelmed when I walked in and saw that it wasn't strictly a deli. Karen, who I learned as I was leaving is the GM there, immediately came over to me and explained how everything worked, including pointing out some favorites in case I found the menu overwhelming. She explained the workings of the salad bar, the specials, etc. at the moment that I was tempted to get back in my car and go someplace that I understood. She was VERY friendly and accommodating.  So, I stayed and had a wonderful experience. My muffaletta sandwich was wonderful, I enjoyed the salad bar, and the iced tea was delicious (which is not true of many places). Of course, Karen kept checking back with me, bringing me containers and a bag for the remainder of my huge sandwich, my salad, and my iced tea, and reminding me that the ice cream and the dry end of the salad bar were complimentary.   Thanks to Karen, as much as to the food, I know that I will be returning. She personally brought such warmth and welcome to my visit. There is nothing like great customer service.

Based on most of the reviews, I must have just visited Butterfields on a bad day. I ordered the Bacon Belgian, and tried to order two eggs ala carte to go with it. My server had a difficult time with figuring out how to take the egg order to begin with, and then when, contrary to what I ordered, the eggs came out with runny whites, she took them out and brought me eggs with even the yolk cooked hard. I paid for it, but left pretty disgusted without eating most of the waffle, and only one bite of the eggs.  Looking up their menu on line since my visit, I realize that instead of charging me $6.25 for two eggs any style, my two eggs should have been .99 each since they were to accompany my waffle... That means I was overcharged in the deal on top of the eggs never being correctly prepared.  I made a note to myself not to go back.

Hungry Howie's has become one of my fall backs for evenings when I don't want to leave home, and need food delivered. They accurately gauge how long it will take for you to receive your order, and the delivery drivers are very courteous. On weekends they deliver until 3am. Thursday until midnight, and the rest of the week until 11pm. You can call or order online.  I've only had their pizza a couple of times, but it was ok, and prepared as I ordered it. My real favorite is the Antipasto Salad. It is hearty, generally good for two meals, and loaded with all sorts of wicked cold cuts that I should not eat, but love. I don't particularly care for their dressings, but have plenty of my own at home anyway.   In addition to ordering meals delivered, I have picked up at their store on occasion. Their staff has always been friendly, helpful, courteous and fast

Enjoyed the Italian Pepper Philly Cheese Steak with hot cherry peppers!    After making a mistake and leaving a review for Philly's Famous that should have been attributed to a similarly named restaurant (I removed once my erroneous review immediately when pointed out), I felt compelled by the actual great reviews for Philly's Famous to visit them and try their cheese steak. Not my usual rationale, and I also wouldn't generally drive 32 miles round trip for a cheese steak, but I realized it just might be worth it.  Arriving after navigating 16 miles of freeway from Scottsdale, I pulled up and parked in front of their unpretentious store front in Chandler Marketplace on the west side of Alma School, just north of Ray Road. It was about 11:35 am, and there were already about 10 cars parked there, and more coming, so I quickly made my way inside.   It isn't a very large place, and there were already 5 people in line ahead of me. It is a small place, with fairly limited seating, but it looked like I was ok in terms of finding a table. You order at the counter, and then take a seat (no table service) until they call out your name. As you walk in, there is a large menu showing lunch specials to your left, and a full menu is on the wall and overhead. I found those menus a little hard to interpret, but when I picked up one of their fliers from the end of the counter, I found that easier to follow.   With people ahead of me, I had a bit of time to consider the menu and determine which type of cheese steak to order. Although they make a chicken cheese steak (wafer thin sliced chicken), I really wanted to try the beef. After several moments consideration, I decided that I was going to order the Italian (provolone cheese instead of white American) Pepper (grilled with sweet bell peppers) Philly Cheese (grilled with sautéed onions) Steak minus the red sauce and with hot cherry peppers added.   By the time is I stepped up to order, my only question was if they actually had hot cherry peppers. The gentleman taking orders was very helpful, clarified which size I wanted (8" or 12") and assured me that they had the peppers I wanted. My 8" sandwich plus a 24 oz drink, a pack of Tastycake Krimpets and sales tax totaled just over $11. Not a bad price for lunch and dessert.  Each sandwich is prepared to order - no overcooked pre-cooked piles of steak on the grill (Yeah!) so I filled my 24 oz cup with ginger ale (yes, ginger ale) from the fountain, picked a table and sat down to wait. From my new vantage point, I noticed that you can request larger portion sizes (meat, etc.) for an added fee. The line by this time was nearly out of the door.   Finally, my name was called and I went to the counter to pick up my sandwich. The Italian Steak roll was fresh, soft and chewy, with an average amount of filling. The sandwich was really good, although I think that the next time I'll have it with the red sauce for a little extra flavor. I was also pleased that my sandwich wasn't loaded with unnecessary oil.   Tables, seemed to turn just as they were needed, with no one standing around waiting for a place to sit. The order line backs up a bit during the lunch rush, but apparently not the seating. They seem to have the details worked out.  It wasn't a wasted 32 mile round trip at all! I left satisfied, and will be making the drive back again!

I've loved this place for years, but it never crossed my mind to write a review.  The food is consistently great, the prices are reasonable, and the service is always friendly and attentive.    I am positively hooked on the Mango Chicken, which makes it really difficult for me to try other dishes, but a couple of weeks ago I tried the Pho and Seafood and loved it.  I've really enjoyed their Curry Seafood when I've had it, and every so often I give in and have the Arizona Fried Rice with extra broccoli.    My choice for a hot summer evening when I want something light and refreshing is the Cool and Zesty Chicken Salad.  There is something for everyone to love here.  I just miss them when they are closed on Sundays and I've got a taste for their great food!

I have driven by Stax for years, but it looked hard to access and the name didn't intrigue me enough to stop. On Monday, I set out to broaden my food options and decided to explore Happy Hour at Stax.  I arrived at 3:30 and decided to sit at the bar, although the seating in general was pretty inviting. The weather was lovely, so everything was opened up to the outdoors. The location is a little unfortunate in terms of the views, so the bar was perfect for me.  Happy Hour was a little confusing, with no happy hour menu in print or on display. You just have to try to remember what the staff tells you. That isn't my strength, so I had to ask several times before ordering.   None of the food that I had a taste for was available for happy hour prices but I was happy to pay regular prices to satisfy my tastes. The happy hour house made sangria, however, was a great deal. I couldn't decide on red or white, so the staff suggested 1/2 and 1/2, which is apparently a popular choice. It was a GREAT suggestion, and I really enjoyed the complexity of the flavors in the combination. I will be having it again!  My food arrived fairly quickly, and was delicious. I had the Wagyu (aka Kobe) and the Ahi sliders. What I loved about their concept was that I could try more than one type of slider thanks to the smaller portions. I could still only eat two, and they weren't cheap by any means, but I really enjoyed the variety.   I considered having a salad, but passed since I had eaten a large lunch and didn't have room, but I would like to try the Caprese salad and the Southwest Chopped salad. I'd also like to return to try several of the $3 sliders on the Happy Hour menu.

I stopped in at Chompies this morning after a terrible experience not far away. I had never been to this location before, and was pleased to see the sign as I was driving down the street. I knew I wouldn't be hungry any longer. Whatever the case, Chompies has always given me plenty to eat.   I went to the take-out counter and was greeted with a smile and waited on immediately by the young man working there. I ordered the #9 which was a bagel (I chose pumpernickel) with cream cheese (I chose lite veggie), tomato, and smoked salmon. I was out of there in about 4 minutes and on my way home to enjoy my breakfast.  It was perfect. The bagel was fresh and delicious, and I was given generous amounts of cream cheese and smoked salmon, in fact I couldn't finish it all. It wasn't cheap, but it was worth every penny. What I also loved is that my sandwich was exactly the way I've had it at the Scottsdale location. This location is actually closer, so I'll be going back soon.

I know that lots of folks LOVE this place, and its tacos, but I just can't get there. My friends have raved about Taco Tuesdays, but the fact that the tacos are fried leaves me cold. I've tried multiple times to enjoy them, but I've had to give up. I guess your tastes just have to run in that direction...

I was craving Chinese food in Scottsdale, and stumbled across mention of this place as genuine N.Y. Style Chinese. Having been raised on the east coast, I grew up eating great ethnic food in general. I love Chinese food, and haven't found great Chinese here in Scottsdale since my favorite closed back in 2001.   Reading the various reviews, I noticed that while some of their ratings were pretty high on various review sites, there appeared to be some inconsistency in the diners' experiences. I was wanting good Chinese enough that I decided to take my chances and perhaps find my new favorite Chinese place.  I decided to eat in since it was about 15 minutes from home for me, so that I could enjoy the food right out of the kitchen, piping hot. When I arrived there were no diners seated in the restaurant, so no problem with getting a table. It is a small place, with no real ambience, but that didn't really matter - I was there for the food.  As there appeared to be no table service, I approached the counter and ordered Hot & Sour soup, which many reviewers had raved about, the House Egg Foo Young which had also gotten good feedback, and substituted fried rice for white rice for only a dollar extra. I also requested that broccoli be added to the Egg Foo Young. The young lady working the counter was perfectly friendly and helped me make the adjustments I wanted.   I sat down and watched as a steady stream of people came in to pick up take-out orders. Most were apparently regulars which I took as a good sign.  My Hot & Sour soup came out very quickly, along with crispy Won Ton chips with a sweet dipping sauce. My soup was good, but not over the top. It was bit thinner than I anticipated, and I can't say it was the best Hot & Sour soup I have ever had. For the price, it was just fine however. Just not as much flavor as I had anticipated from reading the reviews.  My Egg Foo Young came out with perfect timing just as I pushed my soup bowl away. It was a HUGE order, and looked perfect. Brown gravy and Fried Rice were served along side. The Fried rice looked delicious, and I started with that because the Egg Foo Young was still extremely hot.  I would have their Fried Rice again in a heartbeat. They were generous with the bean sprouts and green onions, and there was a nice amount of broccoli stir fried in. It also had peas, onions and carrots. The rice was nicely cooked too. It did need a bid of soy sauce but that was easy to fix.  When the Egg Foo Young cooled enough for me to eat it, regardless of how wonderful it looked, it was a little bid heavy. It is still the best Egg Foo Young I've had in Arizona. Both the Egg Foo Young and the brown gravy needed soy sauce to perk them up. The Egg Foo Young was LOADED with chicken, shrimp, chicken, pork and veggies, and the oiliness of the patties was offset by how thick and loaded with ingredients each patty was. The oil did not saturate them. Although is wasn't quite what I had expected, I would order it again.  If I were back on the east coast, I would have rated this 3 stars. I gave it 4 because it was superior to what I've had here in Arizona over the 16 years I've been here.  As I ate, the steady stream of take-out and delivery orders continued. No one appeared to have to wait for their food any longer than it took to pay for it.   I want to return to try some of the other dishes on the menu. Perhaps tonight just wasn't their best night, but it was good enough.  They only deliver within 5 miles of the restaurant. I had planned to have it delivered, but I was 2 miles too far away.

Truely Satisfying!  I had been intending to have breakfast here for months, and today I finally did. I was totally pleased with every aspect of my visit. The restaurant itself is inviting, and I loved the table I chose in the corner by the window. It was bright and sunny.   Almost immediately after I seated myself one of the servers brought me a menu and let me know that Anne would be my server, and that she would be right with me. Anne came to my table with a smile on her face, and I ordered coffee and asked for a few minutes to study the menu.  I really didn't need much time since I had studied the menu online, and so when she returned with my coffee I went ahead and ordered the Original Chicken Fried Steak and substituted a biscuit for the toast..   The coffee was actually good, not the usual afterthought that many restaurants serve. When my meal came, there was so much food that I literally didn't know where to start, so I took my time buttering my biscuit which I figured was as good a place to begin as any.   Of all of the biscuits I've had in restaurants over the years, this was far and away THE BEST. It was like a really good home made biscuit, and begged to be followed by a mouth full of chicken fried steak with sausage gravy. The chicken fried steak was crisp on the outside and perfectly cooked (not dry) on the inside. The gravy was to die for and the whole dish was nicely seasoned. My eggs were cooked exactly the way I ordered them, and everything was piping hot.   Every mouthful was delicious, but the portion was so large that I soon realized that I wouldn't be able to finish the meal. My decision? I didn't want to leave any of the biscuit behind, it was just too good, so I focused on that and ate almost all of it.   My experience - large helpings of really delicious food, great service, and a really nice friendly environment. Next time I'll order something smaller so that I have room to try the cobbler.

I wish I were writing a different revue, but I had a thoroughly disappointing and overpriced Thanksgiving meal at Eddie's House.  Two years ago I dined at Eddie's House on Thanksgiving.  It was a fabulous meal, and as Thanksgiving approached this year, I made sure to make reservations early to repeat the experience.  I arrived with taste buds ready for another delightful meal.  I didn't care that it would be a $49 meal if I were to be wowed by it.    I started with the shrimp cocktail, which was really very good, except that the cocktail sauce was  so spicy (hot) that I had to avoid it to the extent possible.  The smoked oysters on the cocktail were a tasty but incongruent touch.  The stuffed celery was also incongruent, but ok.  No problem, the best was yet to come, right?  I was looking forward to my first bite of turkey.  When I had it two years ago, I remember tasting herbs that I really enjoyed.  This year, nothing.  Just turkey.  It was moist, but salt was the only apparent seasoning.  It had a bit of fat across the top of each slice, but not the bit of crisp skin that I recalled from two years ago.  It was all just very average.  The green beans were ok, the mashed potatoes were barely ok and obviously re-heated as the texture was off, there were no elevating elements in the stuffing, and only a hint of the giblet gravy. No element of the plate stood out as worth ever experiencing again - even for a fraction of the price.  I was SO disappointed.  It all tasted mass produced.  I couldn't tell that I was eating corn bread stuffing.  In a taste test, stove top stuffing probably would have won for flavor alone.  I stopped eating my entrée, hoping that dessert would redeem the meal.  It didn't.  The apple cobbler was either poorly conceived, poorly executed or both.  However it was actually prepared, it tasted like canned apple filling emptied into the skillet (it was served in a small cast iron skillet) topped with a disappointing flavorless Streusel, and heated until almost warm and almost brown on top.  Not a cobbler at all.  There was a dusting of cinnamon around the edges of the plate, but none in the cobbler.  I ate about three bites before abandoning it.  I did not take the leftovers with me.    I won't do this again.  It's like the care went out of the food preparation, and the focus was on cooking enough ahead of time.  I was there early, and it wasn't busy.  There is no reason why more care wasn't put into the food.  It was like eating Thanksgiving dinner at the home of the grandmother who isn't a good cook.  I wonder if anyone bothered to taste it or do any sort of quality control.    Service was friendly, but not very attentive.  Maybe they had tried the food...

I stopped in here to grab a quick bite before my pedicure appointment close by.  I found a nice spot at the bar, and was immediately greeted by the bar tender and brought a cold glass of ice water.    I reviewed the menu, and then ordered a small Cobb Salad, with medium rare Steak on it.  Whey my salad came out, it was larger than I expected, and delicious.  The steak portion was generous, and it was delicious and perfectly cooked.  All of the ingredients were fresh, and when I realized that the kitchen had left off the boiled egg, the bar tender quickly ran back to the kitchen and brought me the missing egg.  It was a very comfortable experience, and I intend to go back to enjoy that salad again sometime soon.

OK, I went to The Mission when they first opened.  I was not impressed by their menu, or by my dinner there that evening.  I eat out every day, but never returned.  Fast forward to today.  I was headed somewhere else, but they were closed for the Labor day holiday.  There were cars parked in front of The Mission (as there generally are) so I decided that perhaps I had been hasty in my original opinion.  Perhaps it was because I arrived after 3:00 when they only serve a limited menu, but I tried the brisket sandwich.  The experience didn't start off bad...it was kind of flavorful and interesting, until I realized that what I was chewing on was mostly fat.  The $12 sandwich was mostly not brisket (coleslaw and such), and the brisket that it contained was very fatty meat.  The second half of the sandwich was so greasy that I passed on the saturated bread and picked through the contents...coleslaw and fat.  No third chance for this restaurant.

This is a clean, pleasant, establishment with professional friendly service, large portions, and good solid execution of its menu.   I had the #1, Gyros and Fries. I loved how hot and crispy their fries were. I didn't mean to eat as many of them as I did, but they were delicious. I think they were coated with batter or something before they were fried. They came out piping hot.   My sandwich was excellent. The Pita was fresh and hot, and the serving of Gyros was generous, and moist, as if it had just been shaved onto the pita. I enjoyed the onions, which were on the sweet side, and not too strong to enjoy. The sliced tomatoes were fresh, and the Tzatziki, while not the best I had ever had, was good enough and plentiful. The portions were so generous that I couldn't finish the fries or the sandwich, although I tried.  I think that next time I will try their Chicago Style Hot Dog, which is very reasonably priced.

Great First Time Fry Bread Experience  I've been in Arizona for over 15 years and have never had Native American Fry Bread. Everyone I know who has had it swears that it is great stuff. Tuesday, I decided it was past time for me to have the experience. I went to Fry Bread House East because it was conveniently located, and had more favorable than unfavorable ratings.  I had a great experience! Thankfully, they were not at all busy when I arrived around noon. The cashier took lots of time with me explaining the menu, and helping me decide what kind of fry bread to try. I opted for savory rather than sweet and settled on the red chili beef Ultimate Taco. That was fry bread made into a taco with refried beans, red chili beef, onions, sour cream, shredded cheese, and lettuce.  Although the fry bread is made to order, my food came out quickly. The portion was HUGE (larger than the paper plate) and delicious. I only could eat a small fraction of it, but loved every bite. I've decided that I'll make the trip there a few more times so that I can try other fry bread preparations. I'm a fry bread fan now!  As an aside, Fry Bread House East isn't much from a décor perspective, and at a glance, doesn't appear to be open because of the construction next door. It's worth visiting anyway for the food!

Dreadful Service  I've had Jimmy John's before several years ago in Minneapolis.. But apparently here in Phoenix, the store personnel must be trained differently. I had to take my sandwich back up to the counter twice to get the thick headed folks working at the one on Camelback at about 16th to get my sandwich the way I wanted it.  I asked for a #10 Hunter's Club with all the veggies. What I got was the standard #10 Hunters Club with lettuce and tomatoes.   After seeing that, I took it back up to the counter, and explained that I wanted all the veggies. They explained to me that those were all the veggies the sandwich came with. I carefully explained that I wanted all of the veggies that they have. The guy said, oh, you want the Freebies. I would have thought he would have clarified when I ordered whether I just wanted everything that came on the sandwich, or the Freebies as well. I said yes, I wanted all of the Freebie Veggies.   I took my revised sandwich and sat down to eat it, only to find that along with the veggies I had requested, they had piled on Italian vinaigrette and Dijon mustard, which I did NOT want.

Beautiful Setting, Perfect Service, OK Food  Big time points for the setting and the service here. You can relax here either indoors or outdoors and feel calm, relaxed and pampered. The staff is exceptional and service is simply what they do. If you go a couple of times they remember you, what you eat, what you drink, and where you like to sit. I love to go there for brunch on Sundays, and am comfortable going there alone.   They work very hard at preparing your food exactly the way you want it - and they should - because it is pretty pricey - but you are paying to be in that lovely setting eating it. I have nothing else good to say about the food, except for the sticky buns. They come with anything that you order, and they are delicious.  Go for the setting, enjoy the sticky buns and the excellent service, and don't give much thought to whatever else you are eating

Satisfied My Ramen Craving!  I have been wanting to find a good bowl of Miso Ramen, and had checked out a few places that I didn't find satisfying. Republic Ramen is not in my neighborhood, but I decided to take the drive to check it out.  First of all, parking was plentiful, and I found a spot with some shade, which is important when it's 109 degrees out. Walking in, there wasn't much in the way of atmosphere, but they had exactly what I wanted on their menu - Original Miso Ramen, which I ordered as is with pork, bean sprouts, carrots, scallions and spinach. You can order additional ingredients, but I wanted to try it with their original preparation the first time. I also ordered Japanese Curry Rice to go to have later for dinner. You order at the register, and they bring your food to your table.   My Miso Ramen came out pretty quickly, and they said they would bring my curry out shortly. My dish looked and smelled appetizing, so I dug in. The miso broth was good, and all of the ingredients tasted fresh. I LOVED the ramen noodles. They were cooked to the texture that I like, slightly chewy, and were delicious with the other ingredients. The serving was so large that by the time I finished all of the solids in the bowl, I couldn't finish the miso broth. They were not stingy with anything in the dish. I will go back for the Ramen again!  I didn't taste the Japanese Curry until I got home. It was still warm, but had an overly oily texture that I didn't care for. It was ok reheated later, but I wouldn't try it again.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other broth flavors for the ramen!

My Favorite Donuts!!! Yummy!!! I Can't Be Strong Here!!!  I simply love these donuts! I don't buy donuts anywhere else. I LOVE the maple glazed donuts and the french crullers. I recently even had the maple bar with bacon on it!!! Talk about absolute decadence...  I tend to end up here during the pre-dawn hours at the drive-thru window. I get a maple glazed donut, a french cruller, and a large coffee with cream (which they put in for you). The donuts literally melt in my mouth with almost a crunch when I bite into them, and a slightly grainy sugary fried taste and texture which is perfect followed by a sip of hot coffee.   Going to the drive-thru I can simply buy two donuts. If I go into the store, I end up so tempted by the display and the aroma that I end up with six donuts... I simply can't be strong here.

I Have To Try This Again. Loved the Hand Pulled Noodles! Hated the Dumplings."  I visited China Magic Noodle House with mixed expectations, but an open mind. The reviews are on the spotty side, but I really wanted to try their hand pulled noodles.   Once I found the restaurant (on the back side of the building) I was immediately pointed to a nice booth by a smiling server and brought water and a menu. I had heard that the lemon tea was good, so I ordered it and settled in to consider the menu.  I had brought a few suggestions from the reviews I had read, and after some consideration, although I knew it was too much food, I decided on the dumplings (pot stickers) and the #34 XO Sauce Beef Noodle Stir Fry so that I could try more than one thing. I only had to wait a couple of minutes for the server to return with my lemon tea (wonderful!), and to take my order. When asked about the heat level of the heat of the XO sauce, the friendly server indicated that it was a little hot for her, but that they can tone it down to be sure it was not to hot for me. I agreed to that.  The dumplings came out first, and fairly quickly, but were a huge disappointment. They didn't look very good and I could tell without touching them that the wrap was dry. The wrap was tough, and where it wasn't tough it was hard. I initially tried to use chop sticks to pick one up, but it was large, heavy and awkwardly shaped. I tried to cut it with a fork I had been brought, but in was too hard to cut. I gave up and picked it up and took a bite. Even that was a bit of a challenge because along with the toughness of the wrap, the meat inside was very densely packed. I tried dipping it in the accompanying sauce, but it wouldn't absorb any of it. Granted, it was a large serving (8 dumplings) but inedible and not very tasty. I didn't even finish the first one. This was starting to look like a bad idea.  As I decided to give up on the first dumpling, my #34 was brought to my table. It smelled great, and was a HUGE portion. As I blended the ingredients together, it felt to me that the dish needed a bit more moisture to keep the ingredients from sticking together. I also realized that the noodles were extremely long and that I had forgotten to order them shaved (easier to eat), but that was my bad.   The dish was, however, delicious. The meat was tender and tasty, I really liked the noodles, and that they still had a slight chewiness. Per my request, the dish was spiced to a perfect heat level for me. The heat was present, but not overwhelming. My HUGE serving had a nice balance of noodles, meat, bean sprouts, carrots, etc. Eating the unshaved noodles was awkward, but I didn't let it slow me down. I only managed to eat about 1/3 of the dish.   I was provided take-out boxes and a plastic bag (helpful), and for what reason I don't know, I took even the awful dumplings with me. I later tossed the dumplings, but found the noodle dish reheated well in the microwave given several minutes at power level 4 in a covered microwave dish.  Overall, I'm glad I came and plan to return again because I loved the hand pulled noodles and lemon tea. I will not be having the dumplings. I still want to try the Ox Tail Soup, and the Noodles with Minced Pork.  I rated this as 4 stars instead of 3 because it is interesting to see the noodles made while you eat, my main dish was REALLY good, and I received prompt friendly service.

I recently had to change to a Gluten Free, egg free diet, and GFC was recommended to me. I bought their bread and it was delicious. I also got a turkey sandwich there which was enough for two meals, and was delicious! I thought I got great value for the price, and enjoyed my meal. Also, once I indicated when ordering my sandwich that I needed to be egg free, the person who took my order automatically noted that she would change the bread to their white bread which has no eggs in it instead of the usual bread they use for the sandwich. They were VERY helpful.

This Is Food And Atmosphere Heaven!  I took a friend here on Monday for his birthday lunch. He had been to the Herb Box before and when I suggested it, he had nothing but great things to say about it. This was a perfect place to take someone who had chosen to focus their diet on staying healthy. Then menu is extensive enough so that there is something for everyone.   We had not made a reservation, but were promptly seated out on the upstairs patio in the shade where we could enjoy the perfect weather. The overall feel of the place was just right from the moment we walked into the market downstairs throughout the entire meal. The atmosphere was calm, and everyone was friendly and attentive.   Within a minute of our being seated, our server arrived to take beverage orders and to ask if we had questions about the menu so far. We ordered Mango Lemonade and settled in to make our lunch selections. Our beverages came out in a matter of minutes.  It was SO HARD for each of us to pick just one menu item. I really wanted to try the Korean Fried Cauliflower, and the Grow Happy Garden Salad was seriously calling my name, perhaps with some salmon. The only way I managed to choose was by promising myself I would come back again soon to try them. Because I was starving, I settled on the Urban Market Steak Salad. My friend settled on the Serrano-Avocado Shrimp Salad and a side of Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese. We considered ordering the Korean Fried Cauliflower as an appetizer, but I just don't have a large enough appetite to eat that much. We had barely decided on our selections when our server returned to refill our lemonade and take our orders.   We settled in to chat and enjoy the environment while we waited for our food. The weather was lovely, and it was quiet enough that we could talk comfortably.   Our food came out quickly and looked wonderful. The steak on my salad was perfectly medium rare as I had requested it, and the rest of the salad was fresh and flavorful with lots of wonderful ingredients in each bite. We both stopped talking and gave our attention entirely to our food for several minutes before relaxing back into our conversation again. Mango Lemonade refills continued to appear on a regular basis.  Our lunch experience was so relaxing and palate pleasing that we completely lost track of time as we finished our food and soaked up the atmosphere. We could have been in and out in under an hour, but we lingered for two.  I had expected to experience service issues based on many of the reviews I read before selecting the Herb Box for lunch, but our service was excellent. Perhaps lunchtime on Monday afternoons is the perfect time. I know I'll be there again next Monday. I'll be having the Grow Happy Garden Salad with salmon!

I Guess You Have To Like Their Chili Rub. Me, Not So Much...  I stopped in for Brunch when I spotted Kitchen 56 on a Saturday around 10:45 am. I had no idea what to expect, but entered with an open mind.  There weren't very many brunch items, but several of their lunch items were listed on the brunch menu. None of them appealed to me, so I decided to keep it basic.   When I asked my server about the Kitchen 56 Scramble of the day, she indicated that the chef's scramble ingredients of the day were bacon (got my attention), mushrooms, and pepper jack cheese. She indicated that the scramble was then served on a bed of crisp O'Brien potatoes with peppers and onions. That sounded like a good choice, so I selected it, and settled in to wait.  Looking around, I found the décor very pleasant and inviting. Although I wasn't drinking that early, the drink menu looked really interesting. They had specials on Bloody Marys, Mimosas, and Grapefruit Mint Bellini's. I tucked that information away for the future.  My food arrived quickly, and was very hot. The portion was generous, and I could tell it was far more than I could manage to eat. The scramble was tasty, although I didn't understand the addition of thinly sliced potatoes to the scramble, when it was served on a bed of O'Brien potatoes. The O'Brien potatoes, unfortunately, were a bit salty, and had was flavored with a seasoning that I didn't like at all with the scramble. I had to leave the potatoes alone as they were ruining my scramble, and in fact, caused me to stop eating all together.   When my server cane around, and I asked her what the seasoning was, she indicated that the potatoes were seasoned with their "Kitchen 56 Chili rub". As soon as she said Chili, I could peg the taste. When I indicated my dislike of it, she did offer to bring me some more potatoes with none of the seasoning, but by then the flavor had gotten into the scramble and ruined my experience.  Service was good, the environment was pleasant, the prices were a touch on the high side, but overall it seems like a nice place. Unfortunately, I think that they rely on their chili rub in a number of their dishes. Since I don't like it, I don't think I will be returning.

Wonderful Calamari!!  I've become a regular at Tommy V's because I LOVE their Calamari. My favorite meal there is Fried Calamari and a yummy Caesar salad with a glass of wine. Their happy your starts at 11:00 am each day, and so having lunch from the happy hour menu is a first rate deal.  It is a lovely spot, and the service is outstanding. An additional plus for this Old Town Scottsdale restaurant is that they have their own parking lot.

The band of my favorite watch apparently had lost a screw.  I was about to toss it, but thought to give repairing it a try.  Gemtime showed up in a search for watch repair near me.  I then came to yelp, saw all of the great reviews, and decided to drive over there.  The gentleman working there was very friendly and helpful.  I didn't have to wait, he took the time to examine my watch carefully.  As it turned out, part of the screw had actually broken off and was still lodged in the hole.  He was very nice, and tried to get it out, but it was impossible.  The watch could not be repaired, but he apologized and didn't charge me for his efforts.  I really appreciated the courtesy with which I was treated even though the watch I brought in wasn't a high end product.

I have been treating myself to staycations in the Scottsdale area since I moved here in 1999, but The Canyon Suites is my absolute favorite.  I love living in Arizona so much that I can seldom bring myself to vacation elsewhere.  I had stayed at the Phoenician, but somehow wasn't aware of the Canyon Suites until I noticed it among my SPG options.  What a find!  I had a lovely quiet terrace partially shaded by trees.  It was at the far end of the building, and was so very private and quiet that I spent the better parts of my days there with a book and a few snacks.    The rest of my suite was comfortable and luxurious.  I fell in love with the tub in my bathroom, and I appreciated the wonderful bath amenities.  It was like an amazing home away from home!   In addition to the beauty and amenities of the overall  property, I especially enjoyed the wine tastings, accompanied by lots of tasty morsels.    I'm already starting to think about my next visit!

This place is not fancy, but it's cute, and the owner clearly puts her all into what she is doing.  When I was there yesterday in the early afternoon, this was a one person operation.  The owner (Esther) did everything from seating customers to cooking their food, and she went about it smiling pleasantly and appearing quite calm no matter how fast she was moving.  Be prepared for everything to take longer than usual given that she works alone, but the results are very tasty.    I had lots of time to peruse the menu and make my decision.  I was prepared for that by the reviews, which also mostly indicated that it was worth the wait.  It was nearly 15 minutes before I was able to order, and another 5 before my iced tea was delivered to me.  I would have been irritated, but I knew what to expect before I came, and wasn't in a rush.  She apologized for the delays and was constantly on the move. I had intended to have the Oxtail Stew, but she was out of it.  I then decided on the Jerk Chicken and an order of Pof-Pofs (round fried donut like dumplings).    The food took time to prepare, and the Pof-Pofs came out first, with a warning that they were very hot.  They were crunchy, golden, and just sweet enough but not too sweet.  The dough was a bit heavier than a regular donut but I really enjoyed them once they had cooled off a bit.  Shortly after the Pof-Pofs I was brought a plate piled high with Jerk Chicken and Jolof Rice.  I wished that I had ordered the rice spicy, but the hot sauce she brought me (with a warning that it was very potent) was just the thing.  I don't know what type of hot sauce it was, but it was a pale pinkish sauce that added an interestingly flavored heat to my dish.  It was perfect, and a little went a long way.  The Jerk Chicken was wonderful and was grilled with lots of onions.  The portion was generous and delicious, and I ended up taking most of it home with me to enjoy later.  The hot sauce added a nice flavor and heat to the chicken too.  The to-go box required another wait, but customers who were there ahead of me had finished and departed, so paying my tab went quickly.  I do not speak of the waiting to be critical since I was prepared for it, and came for the food, not for speed.  I speak of it to reiterate you should arrive prepared to take your time.   It is amazing that Esther manages to get everything done and remain so pleasant.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and it was interesting to watch her in action.

I just quickly stopped in here on a whim to grab a snack to take with me. It was a pleasant little place where I just wanted to sit down for awhile, but my schedule wouldn't allow it. When I got home and had my bran muffin, it was to die for. Moist, lots of bran texture, and a nice glaze on it. In addition, it was huge, so I got to have the rest the next day!

Grand Canyon Loop Day Tour Is The Way To Go!! Great Experience!  My friends had been giving me grief for years about living in Arizona since 1999 and never having been to the Grand Canyon - not that I even leave my zip code very often...   After a recent, pretty severe round of ribbing from my friends, I went on line and discovered Arizona Scenic Tours. Reviews of the company and their tours were really good, and they offered exactly what I wanted, a one day Phoenix, Grand Canyon, and back day tour. Reviews of that particular tour made it sound like exactly what I wanted - an enjoyable tour with a great guide without me having to get behind the steering wheel to accomplish it.  I contacted Steve, the owner, to find about availability, and he was able to book me for a very reasonable priced upcoming tour with two couples. He arranged for the tour to pick me up at my house in Scottsdale at 7:30 am on tour day, and drop me off back at home upon arriving back in the area around 8:30 that evening. What easier way could there be to see the Grand Canyon, and get my friends off of my back.  I ended up having an enjoyable and enlightening day from start to finish. The tour guide, Mike, was friendly, affable, really knew his "stuff", was easy to listen to, and had great sense of humor. By the time he had all five of us on the tour in the van for a short while, we had become a comfortable and companionable group.   We left the Phoenix area a little later than anticipated due to scattered pick up locations, but once on the road, we made good time. We learned that Mike had gone above and beyond the call of duty to arrange for a weather change from the rainy overcast day originally forecast for our tour, to a bright sunny one. Not every tour guide has those skills...  Our first stop was Montezuma's Castle. I had been there previously, but it was much more interesting with all of the information and details that Mike brought to the table - most of which I didn't learn on my original visit there. He made sure we gained admission quickly and conveniently, and that we got back on the road in a timely manner.  Arriving at, and leaving Montezuma's Castle, and throughout the trip, Mike made sure we were supplied with cold water, or soda if we preferred.  All along the way from Phoenix, to the Castle, on to the Grand Canyon stops, and back Mike filled in the drive with information about the various areas we were passing through, including changes in vegetation at various elevations. The entire tour was much more interesting than I had anticipated, and I found that the day passed quickly.  We visited overlooks at the Grand Canyon Village, Yavapai Point and Desert View Watchtower, each of which had unique views and attractions. There was plenty of time to grab food and take in the sights as we made the three stops. While not being intrusive, Mike was a wealth of information all along the way. I don't think I would have found the tour so interesting without the points that Mike was making.  We even got to see and photograph several mule dear as we waited in line at a stop sign leaving our initial lookout. They seemed not even to notice the traffic as it passed them.   We left our final stop at the Desert View Watchtower at around 5:15 pm, and headed past the Little Colorado River Gorge, and along the scenic route through the colorful Painted Desert.   The sun set as we reached the vicinity of Flagstaff, and there wasn't much left to see after that point, but it had been a great day. Traffic delays caused us to get back to the Phoenix area a bit later than anticipated, but we were all pleased not to have been part of the Labor Day traffic backed up in the direction from which we had come.   It was a great day, and I am now considering doing the Sedona tour next!

Best Pizza Ever, Hands Down  I had some shopping to do at Town & Country Plaza, but hadn't had a thing to eat all day. I saw the sign for Pizzeria Bianco and decided to see if they were too busy to accommodate me. (I had heard that there was always a line to get in.)  Well, it was apparently my lucky day. When I entered the restaurant, I was promptly shown to a nice seat at the bar and provided with ice water and a lunch menu.   The menu wasn't large, and my eye immediately focused on the pizza selections. There were 6 pizza offerings, 3 with red sauce, and 3 without. I wanted something straightforward, so I settled on the pizza margherita (tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, and basil) and asked them to add garlic. I was assured that the crust would be thin and crisp. I also ordered a glass of the house red wine, and settled in to wait.  While I was waiting, the couple next to me generously offered to share their pizza with me since they had more than they could eat. I let them know I appreciated the offer, but that I was reserving my appetite to be able to finish my own pizza.   It came out moments later, and looked perfect. Biting into my first slice was even better. The crust was super thin, crisp, and tasty. This was not going to be one of those pizzas where part of the crust would be left on the plate. Every bit of each slice demanded to be eaten. the tomato sauce was just acidic enough, and married well with the fresh mozzarella, basil, garlic and the crust. Each mouthful was light and delightful. There was nothing heavy at all about my pizza. I was glad that I had kept it simple rather than ordering a pizza heavy with ingredients.   Pizza devoured, I became curious about the dessert offerings. I hadn't seen any on the menu, and so had to quiz my server about the possibilities. I settled on a pear tart, garnished with a dip of nutmeg Italian ice. The pear tart was nice, but the nutmeg Italian ice was out of this world. Yum!!! It almost tasted perfumed with the nutmeg, and slightly custardy. I didn't even need the pear tart.  I have to go back again for the pizza, but I don't intend to leave without having the nutmeg Italian ice again. My entire lunch was such a treat. This is now at the top of my list for best pizza.   The service, while very friendly, was a little spotty. I wasn't sure at several points, who was supposed to be taking care of me, and about the time I finished my pizza, everyone disappeared. I had to solicit someone to discuss dessert, and again, to pay my check. I enjoyed my meal so much that I really didn't mind too much.  ------------------------------------------------Second Visit 9/8/15------------------------------- OK, I am now still a fan of the pizza, but NOT a fan of the service.  It was worse than spotty this time.  I was able to place my order, but then there was apparently a shift change.  Someone did bring me the piping hot pizza I had ordered - and it was perfect again - but then no check back to see how it was, no service period until someone finally noticed my plate pushed away and came to take it around 10 minutes after I had finished.  It wasn't busy, there were all kinds of staff standing around across the room talking to each other.  I stand by the pizza, but the service was so poor that I cut way back on my tip.

Interesting Atmosphere. Good Burgers     Friends had recommended Rehab Burger Therapy some time ago, but when I reviewed the menu online, it didn't hold much appeal for me.   Finally, the other day when I had a taste for a Plaza Burger (burger with sour cream and chopped onions) Rehab was the only burger place I could identify nearby that definitely had sour cream on the menu.   I walked in for a late lunch, and luckily found a seat at the bar. The place was packed both inside and outside. The staff was really swamped, but my server took the time to flash me a big smile when she came to take my order. I ordered my relapse (small, 5oz) burger medium rare with sour cream and onions. I was about to order sweet potato tots, but the woman to the left of me looked like she was really enjoying her skin on fries, so I decided on them instead.  When my server brought my food, she again smiled, and I noticed that she made a point of smiling at everyone. It was a nice touch. My fries were hot, delicious, crispy and perfectly salted. My burger, unfortunately, was over cooked (well done). I didn't take the time to send it back because I was very hungry, and short of time. I did mention it to the server and she indicated that the kitchen tends to overcook the small burgers. She suggested that the rehab burger (large, 10oz) is more likely to be cooked to the desired level of doneness, but I also might want to order the small burger rare the next time. (I appreciated the information) She offered to have it remade, but I had already nearly finished it. It wasn't bad by any means, just more done than I like. If I could have given an award to her for friendly service, I would have done so.   Overall I liked the place and enjoyed my food enough to go back and take a friend a few days later. We ordered our small burgers rare (with lots of emphasis..) and we received perfectly cooked burgers, although our fries were barely warm. We were short of time and happy with our burgers and let the cool fries slide. She loved the Hatch Burger, and I stuck with my sour cream and onion burger again.

Best Airport Food Time After Time!  As a frequent traveler from Phoenix Sky Harbor Terminal 4, I have found Chelsea's Kitchen to have the most consistently delicious airport food available for several years. When I fly. this is simply part of my routine, and it is far more predictable than what I might find available beyond the security checkpoints.   Granted, Phoenix Sky Harbor has added numerous restaurants, but none as satisfying as Chelsea's.  Generally, I travel in the morning, so their Classic French Omelet is my favorite. I add either applewood smoked bacon or ham. The omelet has always come out perfectly cooked, and with exactly the right balance of spinach and gruyere cheese to the eggs. Although I have had numerous breakfasts at Chelsea's, I can not bring myself to have anything different. It is THAT good.  Traveling later in the day, my fallback is the Tuna Sashimi Salad. The Del Mar salad deserves mention, but I am hooked on the Tuna Sashimi Salad.  Service has always been great. I sit at the bar, and the bar staff is very attentive. I've had excellent Bloody Marys on occasion, and their coffee is always really good.  Chelsea's has simply become how I start my travel. I have not been disappointed yet. It is a bit on the pricey side, but nothing is cheap at the airport...

Wasn't Worth the Drive Across Town  I had heard a lot of hype about Matt's, and had friends who went there who raved about the place, so I made the 30 minute drive to try it out.   The place was packed, and had people waiting for tables, so I took an open spot at the counter. To start with, the stools were completely made of metal, including the seat which was hard, slippery, and shaped like a button mushroom with no contours for comfort. I was uncomfortable and felt like I had to brace my knees against the counter in order not to slide off.  It didn't take very long to place my order, for the "Chop & Chick" and I was brought coffee right away. The server was friendly. The coffee was alright, but the server didn't return to see if I wanted a refill while I was waiting for my breakfast. The wait to receive my food was on the long side, but I can see that being so busy would slow the process. The wait wouldn't have been a big deal, but my stool was so extremely uncomfortable that I almost left.  When I was just about at the end of my patience sitting so uncomfortably, my food came, and the server finally refilled my coffee.   I can't say anything good about it. The portion was average - disappointing given the "Big" in the restaurant's name. My pork chop was way overcooked (dry) and apparently unseasoned, and there is nothing complementary that I can say about the home fries. They didn't mess up the scrambled eggs, but my breakfast overall was so unappealing that I only ate a couple of bites. Since my server hadn't returned to see if my meal was satisfactory, I decided to throw in the towel and just get off of that stool and out of there. I left enough money for the food, headed out the door, and back across town and had a fine breakfast elsewhere.   At Matt's, I didn't get quality, quantity, value, flavor or service. I didn't even get breakfast.

I had been to the Super L Ranch Market next door at the Cofco Chinese Cultural Center, and was craving Chinese food so I headed for Beijing Garden Chinese for a late lunch. As I approached the entrance, a group of 4 diners came out - headed to their car. I asked them how they enjoyed their meal. One of them said he really enjoyed his shrimp dish, but the others didn't want to comment. Since the one gentleman was enthusiastic, I decided to continue inside.   As I entered, I was greeted and led right away to a table near the kitchen entrance. As I took my seat, I could see that the plates on the table in front of me were both chipped. I asked for a plate that wasn't chipped, and it took my server a minute to find one which she switched from another table before she delivered a glass of water, and left me with the menu. Looking around, I noticed that there were very few diners present.  The menu was quite extensive and a bit overwhelming. It helped somewhat that photos of some of the dishes were included, but dishes were less than completely described, providing little sense of flavor profiles, or how one sauce might compare to another. I love vegetables, and wanted to be sure that whatever dish I ordered had plenty of them, in addition to meat or seafood. Understand that by vegetables, I mean nutritious vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, snow peas and the like, not just onions and bell peppers or celery. I also wanted lots of flavor as opposed to a bland dish.  The more I studied the menu, the more questions I had about the various preparations, but for at least 10 minutes, no one came within hailing distance of my table. Finally, with a couple of potential items in mind, and a host of questions, I closed my menu and put it down. Only at that point did my server re-appear.   She wasn't particularly helpful in terms of being able to describe flavors of the dishes, and we appeared to be having some language barrier difficulties. I had been leaning to the Beef with Broccoli, perhaps with garlic sauce instead of brown sauce. After explaining that the garlic sauce was a white sauce that they used with chicken. She indicated that I should just get #82, the Beef with Black Pepper Sauce in Sizzling Plate, which had more spice. I finally convinced her to have Broccoli added to the #82 after clarifying that bell peppers and onions were not sufficient to meet my taste for vegetables. When I asked if they could add a level of spice to the dish, she said no, but she would bring me some hot oil. While not busy at all, she appeared frustrated by my questions, so I left it at that, in addition to some hot tea - hoping for the best.   She brought my tea almost immediately, along with a dish of white rice covered by a bowl, and hot chili oil. I opened my book (dining alone, I always carry one) poured some tea, and settled in to wait for my meal which I thought would be out in short order since the rice had already been brought.  After a good while, a young man set a heated metal plate in a wooden base before me. From a white soup bowl, he poured my beef dish onto the hot plate where the ingredients at the bottom against the plate began to sizzle and give off a delicious aroma. The slivers of beef were in a bit of sauce, and were clearly seasoned with black pepper. The beef apparently had been sautéed with pieces of bell pepper and onions about the size of quarters, and broccoli. Overall it smelled wonderful, and looked appetizing, and the portion size was generous.  I spooned rice, which I realized was now barely warm, and the beef dish onto my plate. After an initial taste, I added Chili Oil to my plate, and to the remainder of the beef dish.   The dish was overly salty overall - although not too salty to eat initially, provided each mouthful included lots of rice. After my first few bites, I realized that not only was the rice not hot, but neither was the beef dish. I found that by digging to the bottom of the metal plate, I could find meat and vegetables that were warmer and almost hot. Each bite tasted overwhelmingly of black pepper. I soon gave up trying to eat it, poured some more tea, and went back to reading my book. No one bothered to approach my table for another 15 minutes - this time I checked my watch...  When someone did return, it was with my check. No one ever asked me how my food was, or if I wanted a take-out container for the large amount of remaining food. They simply removed it. When they saw that I had produced my credit card, they came to collect it right away, and returned in very short order with my card, my receipt, and a fortune cookie, and left my table with no further comment.  Overall, my experience was disappointing. There may be wonderful things on the menu, but they are not helpful at assisting you with finding them.

I stopped here for breakfast, and thoroughly enjoyed the Waffle Cristo. It wasn't a combination I would have thought of, but I was so glad I ordered it! The contrast of sweet and savory was to die for. It was set off nicely by their delicious iced coffee, which has a slight richness to it that I love. It makes me slow down a bit just to savor it.

I finally had an opportunity to stop in at Bei during happy hour on Monday, and I'm glad that I did.  I especially enjoyed my spicy tuna hand roll, and the spider roll was yummy too.  Service was fast and friendly, and my food came out promptly, and portions were large.  The items that I ordered from the happy hour menu were great values.  This is definately my new neighborhood sushi stop!

I hadn't been to Bei for quite some time, but decided to stop by the other day to satisfy my craving for sushi. I got there just in time to order from the lunch menu before the kitchen closed until dinner. (The restaurant closes each day at 2:30, and reopens at 4:30)   It was just a few minutes past 2:00, but my server was helpful enough to let me know that it was last call for lunch orders, and when the kitchen closed, that was it, and she wanted to be sure I got in under the wire.   I made a quick decision to have the Sushi Combo, which was miso soup, tuna, salmon, yellowtail and shrimp nigiri, and a California roll or Spicy Tuna roll - which looked like a good deal at $9.50. For my roll, I wanted to have a spicy tuna hand roll instead of the standard roll. The server said that was no problem. I also asked it she could be sure it was spicy, and she indicated again, no problem.  My miso soup arrived within moments. It was pretty basic, but met my needs. My sushi also arrived quickly. The fish tasted fresh, and even the shrimp, which I am not generally a big fan of, was good. My spicy tuna hand roll started off ok, although I could see, and taste with my first bite that siracha had been used to supply the heat.   I don't have an objection to siracha, but in most spicy tuna I have historically had, the heat has been supplied by chili oil, which adds heat without the tuna flavor being drowned out as it was with the siracha in this case.   By the time I got 1/2 way into my hand roll, all I could taste was siracha. I had to drizzle a bit of soy sauce with wasabi into the roll to offset the overwhelming siracha taste with a different and less sweet element.  I know the next time to request that siracha be kept to a minimum, and that chili oil be used for heat. I believe Bei will be able to accommodate that request.  On this visit, everything happened so fast that I was finished with my lunch in about 15 minutes. My server assured me that I could take my time, and that only the food order was time sensitive, but since I was finished, I requested my check anyway. It was a pretty quick lunch - in and out in 20 minutes!   Still, I will be going back again soon. The service was great, and Bei is accommodating. I'll bet they can prepare me exactly the spicy tuna roll that I want!  Also, my prior meal with them was excellent.  For the money, my lunch was a great deal! Next time, the Sashimi Combo!

Given some of the reviews, I had high expectations for AZ BBQ Shack. I arrived for a late lunch and so didn't think it was remarkable that the restaurant was empty. My server was friendly enough, but not very attentive. At his suggestion I ordered the Tri Tip Sirloin sandwich. My food came fairly quickly, and was hot. It was served plain, just a sandwich on a bun on a plate with no garnish at all. The meat was sauced already and was very salty. The flavor was ok at first, but eventually the salt was just too much and I had to give it up. My server never returned to see how my food tasted, or to see if I wanted anything additional. I finally had to go ask him for my check after sitting there for some time. I'm not tempted to try this again.

An Interesting Experience In A Pleasant Setting  I had noticed the Cornish Pasty Co. when it first opened, and made a mental note to try it sometime. I especially loved the setting, and the bar open to the outside called my name. When I finally visited recently, I really loved just sitting there people watching. The service was friendly and prompt and I had a been in front of me in no time at all.   Because I was completely unfamiliar with Pasties, I wasn't quite sure what to expect in terms of the flavor or texture. I ordered the Oggie (the traditional pasty) with steak, potatoes, onion and rutabaga because it seemed like a good place to start.   When my pasty came, is was golden brown, and piping hot. (a good way to start) I enjoyed my first bite of the crust, but from that point forward was disappointed. I think that I had built my expectations up too much, and that this style of food is just not what I enjoy. It was probably completely authentic and correct. I was left flat in terms of flavor, and wished that I had instead ordered something less traditional and more juicy and savory. I did not find that the gravy really helped much and ended up adding quite a bit of salt and pepper to encourage myself to consume my pasty.   I gave the Cornish Pasty Co 4 stars because I believe that they deliver what they say they will deliver and they deserve the benefit of the doubt. It just didn't suit me. They deserve points as well for the excellent service and marvelous, fun, setting.  I also really enjoyed the beer recommended to me by the bartender.

I just found my sweet spot on the menu!  Crispy Chicken Sammy!!!  My second visit here, and again, I sat inside at the not too busy hour of 2:15.  Service, just as before, was rapid and friendly.  I had done my research, and already had a plan, so I didn't need to figure out the menu options this time.  I also already grasped the concept, and that the prices related to quality, organic, local ingredients.  I even knew what the numbers on the floor were for, although I didn't need to use them. (They are so if you are waiting for a seat, you know the order in which you get to be seated.  Pretty clever.)  I am now hooked on their Crispy Chicken Sammy.  They marinate their chicken breast in buttermilk, and pound it to make it super tender.  Then, it is lightly battered, deep fried, and served up juicy, crispy and tender on a bun with pickles, slices of granny smith apple (it works) and spicy aioli.  This is a sandwich that I intend to have frequently.  It is madly perfect.  Also to die for are the deviled eggs.  I wasn't sure how I would like the beets, but there are just a few pieces diced on top of each egg, and they work perfectly.  The eggs themselves were light, perfectly seasoned and piled high with deliciousness.  My shattered potato chips were perfect, and having the lebni on the side was the right way to go for me.  This trip, I added a Sangria to my meal, and it was just the right touch.  I also ordered a nice little house salad with goat cheese and sunflower seeds that I hadn't noticed on my last visit, and it struck me as a generous portion for the price.  Although I'm curious about other items on the menu, I think that I know what I will be eating here for awhile...Crispy Chicken Sammy, Deviled Eggs and Sangria.  I may eventually get around to trying something else, but I can't imagine a better meal.

Great Sunday Brunch!  Although I didn't really want to wait until 9:30 for breakfast, I wanted to do something different this morning. After passing by Hula's for months, I scanned the reviews and the menu and decided to stop in and give it a try.  I sat at the bar, and the bartender immediately came over, provided me with drink and food menus, and asked what he could bring me to drink. I indicated that I hadn't been in before, needed a few minutes, and wasn't in a hurry. He said just to let him know when I was ready.  A few minutes later I made my decision, and put the menu down. He immediately returned. I asked if they had decaf coffee, and he said he would be glad to brew a fresh pot for me. I asked for half caffeinated half decaf, and ordered the Portuguese Sausage Island Benedict, and explained that I needed my eggs to have completely firm whites. He said that would be no problem at all. He was attentive, friendly, smiled and made good eye contact at all times - hallmarks of great service.  A short while later he brought my coffee. It was WONDERFUL. He explained that it was Kona coffee, and that he would refill it whenever I was ready. I relaxed and opened my book (I always carry one) and settled in to enjoyed reading and sipping my coffee.  My food did take a fair amount of time to be prepared, but I arrived right when they opened and allowed that they were probably just getting going. I also knew that my egg preparation would take extra time and attention. I had a refill on my coffee as I continued to wait. I wasn't in a hurry, and was enjoying the setting.  When my plate arrived, it looked perfect, and when I cut into my eggs they were done exactly the way I had asked for them - a big deal for me since I'm finicky about eggs. The English muffins were still soft enough to absorb the delicious hollandaise sauce, which was generously applied to the dish. The Portuguese Sausage was perfectly cooked and still juicy but not fatty. My hashbrowns were crisp, the way I had ordered them. My plate was perfect, and I took my time enjoying it. The bartender checked back with me soon after I tried my dish to make sure it was to my liking, and to refill my coffee again. The portion was too generous for me to finish, but the dish was so good, I didn't want to stop eating it.  The restaurant wasn't busy yet, so I felt free relaxing, reading, and sipping coffee. When I realized that the morning happy hour had started, I decided to try a cranberry mimosa for the bargain price of $2. Who could pass that up! It was a great way to finish off my meal. Full, refreshed, and ready to go, I couldn't believe that my entire bill was only about $15.   Overall, a great experience. Great service, great food, and a relaxing environment. I will be returning. I want to try the Spam Island Benedict next.

Based on a recommendation from a friend, I've now visited KT's 4 times now, and had 2 pedicures, and 4 manicures.  All were excellent, and I was very pleased with the immediate results, and how well my manicures and pedicures held up.  Both Kimmy and Tim are friendly, professional, give great attention to detail, and are a pleasure to converse with.  I had tried a variety of nail shops over the past several years, but I don't ever have to worry about the quality of service at KT's.    Although they take walk in's, I recommend making an appointment, especially on the weekend when they can get pretty busy.

Healthy, Tasty & Gluten Free!!!  Having gone gluten free and egg free two weeks ago (yes, I'm counting) I've been on a quest for places to dine that meet my dietary restrictions, and provide tasty nutritious food.  I was delighted to discover Grabba Green.    Before visiting them, I spent quite a bit of time on their website.  In addition to giving up glutens and eggs due to sensitivities, I have to balance my carbs and proteins so that each meal I consume has at least as many proteins as carbohydrates. Their website identifies the ingredients in each of their menu items.  Access to  nutritional breakdown information is available as well.  I was able to develop a list of which menu offerings fit my needs whether "as is" or with some tweaking of the ingredients.  This may not be important to most people, but it really was helpful to me.  It was also very cool that their online menu has a feature where if you click on the item, it shows you a picture of the menu item, clearly showing all of the ingredients.  I arrived at around noon on a Monday, and it thankfully wasn't too busy.  The restaurant offered only counter service, but was clean and pleasant with a fair amount of table space.  Their menu includes wraps and paninis, and meals (bowls) with either grains or greens as the foundation to which other combinations of ingredients are added.  They also offer breakfast items, a variety of smoothies, healthy snacks, and prepared and made to order juices.    The young man who waited on me was super friendly, and took time to verify for me that the dressing for the salad I was ordering "On The Border" didn't have eggs or egg products in it.  That information was not on their website, although Vegan salad dressings were identified as such.  He was also happy to help me reason through how to boost the protein in smoothies that were generally too carb heavy for me to consider otherwise.  Once I ordered, my "On the Border" salad (Spinach, Chicken, Avocado, Black Bean, Red Pepper, Tomato, Cilantro, Cheddar Jack, Yogurt Agave BBQ dressing) didn't take long to prepare.  It came in a brown box with enough weight to feel pretty substantial.  10 minutes later, at home, I was delighted with my salad.  The use of ingredients was generous and well balanced, everything was very fresh, it smelled wonderful, and the flavors were very good.    It wasn't cheap, but I thought that the prices were reasonable for the quality of the food.  I absolutely plan to be eating at Grabba Green again soon.  I already know what I'll have next time!

I received a coupon offering their $39 lobster dinner for $25 and decided to take advantage of it this evening. The reception was friendly, and I was quickly seated at the table of my choice.   It only took a few minutes for my server to arrive. I ordered some wine from the happy hour menu, and when I indicated that I was going to have the lobster dinner, he explained my first course options (soup, or a salad of mixed greens and tomatoes) and that the lobster tail was accompanied by sautéed green beans. I ordered the salad as my first course.  The salad came out fairly quickly. The greens were fresh and the tomatoes tasty, but the salad seemed to be dressed only with some sort of oil. Not much for flavor, so added salt had to do. My server didn't come back by and I was hungry so I ate it as it was. I enjoyed the bread and salted butter I had been brought.  When the server noticed that my salad plate had been pushed aside, he came and removed it and indicated that my lobster should only be a few minutes.  Well, the minutes stretched out a bit, but as the restaurant was filling up, I figured that the kitchen must be getting busy.   After more than just a few minutes (although I acknowledge that I didn't note the actual time) I was presented with my lobster and green beans. Of course, it didn't look like the picture on the $25 coupon I had brought with me, and at a glance, it appeared over cooked. I decided I could be wrong. Cutting through the end of the lobster to separate it from its shell confirmed that my initial assessment that it was over cooked was correct. The lobster tail was pretty small, tough, barely warn, and really (really) salty - but since the server never returned to see if I was happy with my food, and I was really hungry, I worked my way through it, aided by my wine and another piece of bread.   I did eat several of the green beans, but they were tough, and also on the salty side so I gave up on them.  My server did not return after delivering my food to me until several minutes after I had pushed my plate full of green beans to the side. At no point had returned to ask how my food was, nor did he ask when he took away my plate. He offered dessert, but I asked for my check, paid, and left with no intention of EVER returning.  OK, could I have made a fuss and requested that the meal be removed from my check, but because I was hungry, I had in fact eaten it. But I left determined that when I got home I would post a review. I don't like making a fuss in restaurants, or send things back to be redone - I just vote with my feet. If, on a Friday evening, Paul Martin's kitchen thought it was ok to send that over cooked lobster tail out to me, and if it didn't appear over cooked to the server, there are other issues.   Perhaps the servers don't come back to see if you are happy with your food, and don't ask at the end of the meal how your dining experience was, for a reason. They don't want you to tell them what they already know. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. It doesn't make for a good dining experience.  After a bad first experience,this is one of those restaurants I won't visit again - with or without a coupon. This was their experience to get someone new in and WOW them. Well, wow, I can't believe it was so bad.

MUCH Improved!!!  I had a pretty unpleasant experience dining at Paul Martin's some time ago. I believe it was not too long after they opened. The only thing that lured me back to try again was their 3 course Sunday Prime Rib Special.  It is a beautiful venue, and since it wasn't very busy, I decided to sit at the bar where service would be pretty much captive. From the moment that I sat down, the Bar Tender, Dustin, took excellent care of my dining experience. He was on top of everything. In addition, this time, my food was excellent.   The Prim Rib started with a salad course, then there was a main course of perfectly cooked prime rib and mashed potatoes, and finally three scoops of their house made ice cream, with a couple of out of this world sugar cookies.   The last time I was at Paul Martin's, the salad was so poorly executed and poorly dressed that, since no one came back to check on me after leaving it, I had to resort to making up for the missing dressing with salt. Not so this time! It was perfectly dressed and delicious! Also, because Dustin continuously checked back with me, if there had been anything amiss, I know it would have been tended to.   When I cautiously asked for my Prime Rib rare, he assured me that they would prepare it any way that I would like - and they did! The Prime Rib was delicious, even if I didn't quite get their take on creamy horseradish sauce. It was a little too adulterated with other ingredients, and I couldn't taste the horseradish. I'm not a purist, but when asked, Dustin brought me a little dish of plain horseradish. Perhaps it was house made in some off beat way. It didn't taste like horseradish either, and had absolutely no bite,. That was OK though, the Prime Rib was just fine on its own. The mashed potatoes with the Prime Rib were delicious!  Finally, full as I was, I gave in to the house made ice cream. It was the creamiest ice cream I have ever tasted. Along with it were served the most wonderful "melt in your mouth" sugar cookies, with coarse sugar around the edges. I wasn't even close to finishing the ice cream when I had to give up, but I wrapped my other cookie up in a cocktail napkin and took it home for later. No way was I going to leave that cookie behind.  So I had a delicious, well orchestrated meal, and Dustin completely made my experience far and away better than my previous visit. I will definitely be eating at the bar from now on.

Delicious Italian Food, Pleasant Atmosphere and Friendly Service  I had a taste for a nice Italian lunch last week, and was specifically longing for Chicken Marsala. I didn't want to go into Old Town because parking can be a problem. I found La Fontana and some ratings on the internet and decided to try it. I stopped not expecting very much, and had my socks knocked completely off!  When I walked in I grew a little concerned that there was only one table of diners (not generally a good sign), but whatever was cooking smelled wonderful. I was seated at a pleasant sunny table by the a window, and immediately brought cold water with lemon.   It only took me a moment to locate Pollo (Chicken) Marsala on the menu. I struggled for a minute not to be distracted by other great dishes on the menu, but then stuck with my original strategy and ordered Chicken Marsala with extra garlic.   After I ordered, Maria (my server) brought me fresh crusty bread, along with butter, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. As I settled in to read my book and enjoy the ambiance of my window seat, I indicated to Maria that a glass of chianti would be nice too.  Now, I am not an expert on Italian food, but I've eaten enough to have a respectable opinion of what's good. The Chicken Marsala, served with rigatoni pasta was to die for! The Marsala sauce with the extra garlic I had requested was spot on, with a bit but not too much richness, and lots of fresh mushrooms. The chicken breast had been nicely seasoned and was flavorful and moist. My pasta was nicely cooked, and everything was piping hot. I ate as much as I could, and then happily took the rest home with me for later.  All in all, my lunch was perfect, and I hope always to get a seat by the windows. I think the Veal Piccata is next, and then I think Linguine Alla Pescatora (Calamari, Clams & Shrimp in red sauce).  Their web site isn't very helpful, but Maria indicated that they will be working on that.  Some other details: As I understand it, pizza isn't always available, so if you are planning to go for pizza I suggest calling ahead. They now have a bar. They do not serve lunch on Monday or Saturday, and they close between lunch and dinner. The parking lot is behind the building, and the entrance is from the rear.

I saw good ratings, mostly, and I heard from a friend that their croissants were to die for, so I drove to Tempe to try them out. I could comment on a number of things, but I'll stay with the arrogance I encountered.   When I ordered the Croissant Benedict, I was very specific that I wanted my eggs poached medium well, even if the yolks got hard. I explained that I am one of those people who can not stomach runny egg whites. I know that makes me strange, but I literally can't put them in my mouth, so I am very clear when I order eggs. When I ordered, I emphasized that point to the extent that the cashier (you order at the counter before being seated) said "yeah, I get you". Whether or not she communicated that to the kitchen, the eggs I got (after waiting 25 minutes) had runny whites.   When I approached one of the chefs and explained it to him, as I watched, he went to one of the other chefs - presumably the one who cooks eggs. The chef he approached rolled his eyes and made a comment to the chef I had talked to and they laughed. I was standing right there - they could at least have had that exchange beyond my line of sight. Not a good customer moment. Bad eggs and arrogance.  Even though I had already paid for my food, and had eaten nothing. I retrieved my belongings from my table and I left. When I observe that kind of behavior, I don't know what they will do to whatever they bring me next. It may not be "the thing" to dislike runny egg whites, but when I have taken care to be very specific with my order, I am the one who should be rolling my eyes that you can't cook to my specifications.  This feels like a rant, and I guess it is. I don't generally write reviews like this, but no matter how good their pastries are, I would never spend money at this establishment again. I thought it was overpriced to begin with, but overpriced with attitude and poor execution is intolerable.

I noticed this in a restaurant search today, took a look at a few of their reviews, and decided to give it a try.  Wanting to sample several meats, I decided on the sliders since I got to try the chicken, the pulled pork, and the brisket. I ordered the sauce on the side so that I could experience the taste of the meats. As my side, I ordered the potato salad, and decided to pay a bit extra to try the corn on the cob since it isn't offered as a standard side dish to the meals/sandwiches.   Brisket is usually my test for a BBQ place, so I had the brisket slider first. The brisket was unfortunately chopped to the point of being hash like, and was oily and nearly crisp. I couldn't get a sense of the real flavor or texture of the brisket, although it was better without the sauce than with it since the sauce was so extremely sweet. I honestly couldn't tell the difference in flavor between the pork and the chicken. The only thing that gave me any indication was the texture. Both the pork and the chicken were pretty unexceptional. None of the meat tasted the least bit smokey. I suppose that the terribly sweet sauce was supposed to carry the day. The sliders were a complete let down, and not a good recommendation for any of the meat.  The potato salad was bland to the extreme. I'm guessing that it was dressed with a combination of sour cream and mayonnaise and nothing else, not even salt. There was not a hint of onion or anything else at all. I set it aside and ignored it. It did nothing to compliment the meat.  The corn, which I paid extra for, was grilled, but was either overcooked or had been sitting for some time. The corn kernels were all puckered up rather than plump and juicy, and it wasn't particularly tasty. It wasn't buttered, nor was butter served with it. I gave up on it after a few bites.  My lunch was disappointing overall, and I see no reason to return. It also turns out that they have dropped the Texas Beef Ribs from the menu. This was pretty disappointing, and not worth revisiting.

Wonderful Cinnamon Roll!  I can't speak to the donuts here, but stopped in late this morning and picked up a delicious unfrosted cinnamon roll. It was perfect, just sweet enough without being too sweet, and lots of cinnamon. The frosted one looked good, but I decided to keep it simple. I warmed it up at home, and enjoyed it with a cup of coffee.  This wasn't a planned stop, I just recalled that there was a donut shop in the strip mall and pulled in to discover that Born & Glazed (I didn't immediately "get" the name) had just opened a few months ago. The donuts looked interesting and I'll probably try them in the future.  My cinnamon roll was reasonably priced, at $1.79.

Lots of options, tasty but a bit pricey, ability to manage calories, nutrients and flavor  I have frankly never been to a place like this, but to enjoy and benefit from it most, I found it very useful to visit their website before going there. I otherwise would have felt overwhelmed by choice when I walked in. They offer a variety of salads, paninis, wraps, juices, soups and other items in an essentially healthy vein as opposed to other fast foods. Their web site allowed me to completely understand all nutritional and caloric elements of what I might order. It also allowed me to clearly understand that salad and health don't automatically add up, although they offer lots of healthy options.  I've been there four times in the past week, once for a freshly made juice (green detox), once to have a dine in salad (the Ty Cobb) and soup (Jalapeno & Tomatillo Gazpacho). and twice to pick up custom salads to consume at home.   First of all, they have very creative standard and seasonal offerings that run the gamut of flavor combinations and include vegan, organic, gluten free and dairy free options. The calorie and nutrient range is broad, and you can order their regular offerings, or create your own to specification.  I loved my initial Ty Cobb salad, but didn't realize that the calories identified on their menu don't appear to include the dressing, since they make a recommendation, but it is a matter of choice. The salad was excellent. They offer salads in regular and big sizes. I found the regular to be a generous meal for me.   To their credit, they allow tastes of items to aid your choice from a flavor perspective. They also allow you to swap certain elements of their standard menu offerings.  I love the element of choice here, and I love their nutrition calculator on the website that fills you in on everything from cholesterol and sodium to fat, protein and other key nutrient elements as you add or remove components of a dish. It's like my pre-dining entertainment. I also like that I can order my selection on line (standard, or as I custom as I could imagine) for pick up with no wait in line in about 15 minutes.   This location just opened this month, and the staff is still learning the ropes to some degree, but they are friendly, helpful and attentive. The focus of mad greens is their commitment to high quality, organic and local ingredients. They are also committed to fair trade  Their Cannellini Beans have become a staple in my salads here, and I love the spicy avocado (avocado and their mad spice). I am hooked on the slow-roasted chicken and the fat free balsamic vinaigrette. Even so, I haven't had the same salad twice.  I think it will be a long time before I get tired of dining here. You should note, it is not inexpensive, but I think the prices are fair for the quality and quantity.
