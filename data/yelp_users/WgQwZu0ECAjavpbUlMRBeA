I had a bid done and after a couple weeks I called back to have the work done, and the person that did the bid wasn't there any more. (should have been a red flag). So I was told to call another person. I called and left a message, I hear back from him a week later... he told me they would honor the bid but would need a faxed copy of it, it being 2010 I asked if I could email him the original bid that was EMAILED TO ME? He said that he didn't have email so no, I would need to fax it like it was 1993. I did that and didn't hear back form him... and didn't hear back from him... finally I called and left a message again, and I didn't hear back from him. FINALLY, after calling twice I cot a hold of him... He said, he would have the installation people give me a call. They did and set an appointment. The day before the appointment, I got a call from a Baker secretary asking for my credit card information... ? I asked why and she explained that they were going to need to have it to pay for the insulation, i asked if we would pay when the work was done? She said, no it works better if they take my credit card... So i agreed BUT stressed the fact that I did not what to be changed for work that was not done yet... as you can probably guess, they went a head a charged my card. I called and asked why they ran my card... she explained that it was company policy. I talked to another sales guy who said there was nothing he could do... I left a message for "Mr. Fax" and still have not heard back.  The next day I get a call 3 hours before the appointment saying that they are at our house ready to do the insulation. I explain that the appointment is in 3 hours and that no one will be there until the allotted time, as it was a APPOINTMENT. He is a little miffed because he was about to get out early for the day but instead has to go and pick his nose for 3 hours...  Over all Banker was a disaster... I would not recommend using them to put insulation in a dog house.

I was pretty dissappointed with my last visit to this location. The service was really slow and inaccurate (ordered a margerita on the rocks and frozen came). I can't really blame it fully on the waiter, the place was obviously under staffed.  I ordered a green chilli chimmy with green sauce... and it was not good. The beef was dry and flavorous and the green sauce was bla... I couldn't finish it.

Yelp should have been originally designed for places like this... because how many times do you struggled over whether you are getting ripped off at an auto place? You want to find that one place that is just honest... well The Brake Shop is it...  Couple of examples:  I took my car is because I was sure that I had brake problems, they took a look at my brakes and said they just needed to be cleaned, cleaned them out the door, NO CHARGE! I was ready and willing to pay to have my breaks replaced... all they had to do is give the word. They didn't and I got another 6 months out of my brakes.  I recently took my car in because I was sure the exhaust was having problems (yes they do more the just brakes). They told me to wait a couple minutes and if I needed an entire exhaust restructure that they would send me somewhere else because I could get it a lot cheaper!   It turned out that it wasn't my exhaust at all and they the engine was actually broken and it would not be worth it to fix it... which leads me to my last example:  After I decided that it was not worth fixing my car I asked them what they thought I should do with it... they recommended just selling it to a scrap company for parts. I have no idea how to do that but no worries, they stored it on their lot until THEY got a hold of a scrap company and THEY bargained with the company to get me $400 for my piece of junk car... cleaned out any personal belongings and held them until I picked them up!   For these guys it is all about building a relationship... I would take my car to them fro anything.

Went to brunchies for breakfast recently and was mildly to largely disappointed. The food was regular, and the service struggled... It wasn't just the waiter that was over our table, but the whole staff just sat around as our friends baby screamed and we waited for 25 minute while our server was MIA. We asked if we could just pay at the front and NO, that just couldn't happen. So the baby got louder, and we waited and were given some excuse that it was the waiters first day on the job...

I had heard about this place for years but never went. Tragic I know! Just recently I discovered that it was literally walking distance from Jester'Z Improv where I work. Oh, how i must now make up for lost time!  Pop the Soda Shop is a true place of brilliants. They have a fantastic selection and a very knowledgeable staff. When you come to pops that is what you are looking for, product. And they have the best selection in town.   A couple of recommendations. Doctor Eli's Blueberry, Jackson Hole Huckelberry, or really any thing in the Birch Beer section!

My 85 year old grandpa is one of the greatest foodies i know... and it is from him that i get my love for food. I have heard this story of his about finding a little Italian place is Vienna a dozen times and every time the story gets better. I promise this all ties into my review.  I took my grandparents to Tia Rosa or Racho De Tia Rosa if you don't live in Mesa, last week, while they were in town on their way to Norway.   There were 9 of us so we dined in the large room and it was loud. However, they were true to their word and had us seated 5 min after we arrived and 30 min after i called in... this on a FRIDAY! If weather and party size permit i recommend sitting outside, less noise and more relaxing.  I had the chicken mole... the flavor was brilliant but it was a little too spicy, which is a bad combo because i couldn't spot eating and kept sweating and getting the hiccups. I recommend the fish tacos and don't waste your time on the salmon, go straight for two shrimp.   My Grandpa's review of Tia Rosa's: It was worth going just of the Mango Lemonade.

I've been going to the Cornish Pasty Co. for years now.  I love the atmosphere of this little place, it is small and cozy. The service is good... i have never had a bad experience with the service and had a couple of really good ones. I actually wrote a poem about one of the waitresses but I'm not going to go into that.   Now with that out of the way I can talk about the food. I love these little Pasties! My personal favorite is the Pilgrim... but the Chicken Rosemary, Stake Rosemary and Cajan are wonderful too, not to mention the Bangers & Mash, and Shepard's Pie.   After all this... one of my families favorite this to do is just order a half dozen pasties to go and bring them home and just smorgasbord!

Fuego Bistro is on the top of my list for Cen Pho dining. After the first time I went, Kevin (the host) has always remembered my name and that I perform improv.  ALWAYS ASK ABOUT THE SPECIAL.  That being said, the pork is unbelievable! As is the apricot chicken. I would recommend getting the cream corn with either the Orzo or the mash potatoes. But honestly, it would be hard to go wrong with about anything on the menu, including deserts. They have an unbelievable banana burrito desert.  I always make reservations, even on a Wednesday... weekends are packed! The best time of year to go is Fall and April. Unless you are one of the first 15 or so you will be sitting out on the patio, which is beautiful and quaint.

I don't know whether there is a trend for Italian restaurants to open up in old bank buildings... but Aiello's is not the first place I have been to that appears to be located where and old bank use to be.   I started hearing about this place a year ago when it opened. I finally got around to going yesterday for a co-workers birthday.  I have been to a couple of really fancy restaurants and I have been to dozens of Italian restaurants. Aiello's is some where in between...   I LOVED the bread arrangement. Two types of very tasty warm bread, with either vinegar and oil or a chili oil mix. Both very tasty.  The Famous Spaghetti and  Meatballs were recommended to me and so I had to partake, mostly because there were a lot of really tasty looking items on the menu and the fact that the meatballs were top recommendation made me raise and eye brow.  I wasn't let down. The meat ball was a mix of pork and beef, cooked to what I would call was perfection. The Spaghetti was not too strong, but had really nice flavor. I ate one of the two fist size meatballs and took the other one home to my wife.  I want to go back and try about 10 other things on the menu, mostly the Gnocchi looked lovely and some of the salads. I am also super interested in the limited pizza orders that they do for take out nightly.

I really tried hard to go to Local Breeze with out thinking of Palette, but failed miserable and resolved that there will never be another Palette. But at least I can now review local breeze knowing that I can separate LB from Palette. That being said:  I actually got about what I expected from LB. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Lavosh, which was tasty and very large, even for a half. My server happened to be the baker as well and she did a very nice job despite telling me that everything was good, when I asked for a recommendation. The atmosphere was nice, although I can't really approve of there sub par music mix (honestly, Rod Stewart?).   The crown on this occasion and probably the main reason I am giving them a 4 our of 5 was for the Key Lime Pie... which is really a lime meringue type thing. Whatever it was, I will dream about it tonight.   I plan on going back and trying the hummus.  And the Bathroom is awesome too!

I actually really liked Smeeks, I can understand a lot of the hype BUT you can't let your expectations get away from you. And when you take Smeeks for what it is, you have to admit that it is a great place. Any thing that it lacks I am certain the owners will change and develop until it is fitting the needs of its customers... after all the owners are the same owners from Frances, just down the way from Smeeks.  Don't go expecting all your wildest dreams to come true, go expecting yo see a brilliantly displayed collection of colors, candying and collectibles.  ps... they have a lot of great soda!

I discovered these pies last September and feel in love with them. The are very tasty and professionally made. Andrea is committed to providing a really homemade, healthy, comfort food.   All the pies are great but I prefer the larger pies because they have crust all the way around them. The Sassy Pie is absolutely amazing...  Check out the website to see what markets they are at and information about ordering pies. I would suggest going down to a local market and meeting Andrea of one of the people she has working for her.
