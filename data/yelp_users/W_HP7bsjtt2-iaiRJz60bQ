The gas at this station is not the problem here. It's the Car Wash!  My car was filthy due to the rainy days we'd had in the Phoenix area. I drove my car to Tumbleweed to get gas as well as get a car wash. After driving through, I noticed several weird streaks on my car. I tried to buff them out with a clean towel only to make it worse. At first I thought maybe my car was so dirty, that it needed a second wash. About a week later, I returned to this same station for gas and a wash. Again with the weird streaks all over my car! I have washed my car at this station over the last few years when it was a Valero, and never had this issue. Now I am absolutely convinced that the new owners do not maintain the chemicals for the Car Wash. I paid for two Car Washes within two weeks $8  each ..... The Ultimate Car Wash. What it was ..... was an Ultimate waste of money! Do not wash your car here unless you want it to look worse than it did before!

I started training here with Tony back in October 2011. I had tried out a couple personal trainers before him but they weren't the right fit for me. Tony is amazing, knowledgeable, professional and just an all-around fun great guy! He will help you with your goals and adapt the workouts to your level of fitness no matter what shape you are currently in. Since I am a very social person, I signed up to do the group sessions. The people I have met are all very nice and Tony is able to mold the class to fit everyone's fitness level. He even works with your nutrition and gives you suggested meal plans.  I can't recommend him enough. Even my friends have noticed the change in my physique which I owe solely to him. Sadly I will be moving to LA soon and I am extremely worried I will not be able to find another trainer as qualified and awesome as Tony.

I purchased a Groupon to get my carpets cleaned .... 3 rooms for $59. I was a little concerned after seeing the reviews on here but am always game for a little adventure. My carpets are a light oatmeal color which I would never get again. After 9 years, they were looking a little dingy and smushed. There were obvious traffic patterns since I'm usually too spacey to remember to take off my shoes before walking on them. I convinced myself Sir Carpet could probably do just as good a job as I could if I rented my own machine for about the same price. When I called, first available appointment was a month out ..... a little disappointing. Athan, the service tech, called the scheduled day and asked if he could come 30 minutes early. He was very professional, friendly, informative and helpful. He did two bedrooms and one large area rug in my media room. After he was finished, the carpets looked 100% better than they did before. I was completley satisfied with the job he did and found it to be a good Groupon experience as well as a good deal!

Am a huge fan of this eatery!!! The owners hit the jackpot when they brought Chef Holly in from Ticoz. My very favorite thing on the menu is the Blackened Tilapia Ceaser ..... amazing! All the Street Tacos are deeelish ......especially the Pernil Pork and Chicken! The chips are not too greasy or salty and the salsa is roasted and exploding with flavor. I am always blown away by the service and love the atmosphere! It's already a good value for dining but you can get promotions if you are on Living Social or Groupon.

The roof on my central phoenix home was destroyed in the hail storm of Oct 5th, 2010. I received three estimates from different roofers in the area. Advance Roofing Systems was several thousands of dollars less than the others. I met with the owner Ken who was very professional and assured me that they would clean up their work area daily during the project. I have yet to find a roofing nail around the yard and the new roof looks fantastic! They not only replaced the attic vents on my roof but painted all vents, exhaust pipes and air conditioning duct to match. Many of my neighbors had their roofs replaced and not one of their contractors had this kind of attention to detail. Love my new "painted desert" roof!

Just had the Super Spicy Green Salad as a quick lunch. Delicious! The staff was friendly and helpful. One of the few restaurants in Sky Harbor with healthy choices.

Spicy Super Greens salad is deelish! I usually grab one when flying through Sky Harbor. The service is always friendly and helpful and am never disappointed with the quality of the food! I wish you guys offered a gluten-free bread option but maybe in the future!
