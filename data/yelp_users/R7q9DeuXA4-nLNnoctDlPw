I found a hair ball in my half bucket of hot wings. Not only is this disgusting and I lost my appetite, but the owner was plain rude. You don't yell at your customers in person or on the phone (even when your busy). It was my sisters idea to go here and the last time either of us will step foot in that place. This place lacks professionalism, customer service, and cleanliness.

I've been a member for more than 6 years now and have never had a complaint. However, my mother went into this store and I helped her purchase new eyebrow powder, a pencil, and nail polish remover. The make-up artist was busy so we had no help. I usually use Clinique products and go to Macy's but I choose to go the Ulta way. The powder broke within 3 days and my mom went back to the store to try and get a new one (exchange it). The Manager Veronica or Vanessa told my mom she had not purchased it at the chandler store and that they didn't carry that product. Which is such a lie because I went with her. She than proceeded since we threw away the receipt that there was nothing she could do for her because the label on the product didn't even match anything they had in stock. Not only was this experience bad for my mother, when we had made the purchase an old man was working the register and was super rude asking for my card when I told him twice I didn't have one and they always find my account through my email. Sorry this is absolutely the worse customer service I've ever heard of! You can guarantee I will not be a customer any longer.

This place takes 25 mins to make one slice of pizza on a Saturday afternoon. If your hungry and want 1 SLICE of pizza don't come here.

Favorite Organic Salon! I got my hair done by Lacey, she is very knowledgeable and passionate about doing hair. Shes been doing my hair for years now! I love that the manager mentors all girls and is always by their side. I also bought make-up and face wash with the assistance of miss Lacey. I love all their products, plus there all Healthy for you :)
