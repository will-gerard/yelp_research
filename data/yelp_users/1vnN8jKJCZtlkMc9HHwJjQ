Terrible service and overrated ramen and dessert.   I am well educated in noodles. The soup of its ramen is good but noodle is "random", which means you have 50% to get not well cooked noodles and rest for cooked ones based on my experience of four noodle dishes. The noodle was hard to bite and u can see the white texture raw part that haven't been boiled throughly. I have tried many different noodles from several countries in various levels of restaurants and I know what is good cooked noodle. Dessert was only good looking but tasted so-so. Tough texture and miss all good things in Japanese pastry( high quality cream, fine and smooth cake, no overdose sugar)  For the service. Cannot believe the male server is still there. I was astonished by his terrible service before and this time I was not disappointed. But by another server. Indifference and impatience are the words to describe them. The server neither explained the menu nor gave me any suggestion directly. I had to ask her several times for suggestion but did not get results.

Decent food. Terrible service, especially the front desk. Check your bill for overcharge.

At the end of Arizona Restaurant weeks, we finally went to Binkley's. 40 minutes drive should make easily make anyone disappointed if foods are not superior. My overall impression will be good, interesting, small portion but not that impressive. Drinks: Strawberry perfection: use liquid nitrogen to freeze the upper layer of this drink. [4]  Amuse bouche: Duck consomme: salty, rich and taste great. [4] Miniature sloppy Joe: tiny bugger with sour vegetable.  [3.5] Frozen peach arnold palmer: freeze juice.[3.5]  The first course: Smoked Sweet Pea Vichyssoise. [forgot] Citrus cured salmon, horseradish salmon caviar, white wine gelee:  Salty and savory with a sour taste from caviar. Green foam filled into the bowl. [4] Blueberry-Midori Bomb: an interesting dish with juicy blueberry juice wrapped in a spoon with lemon and olive oil. [4]  Second course: herb roasted leg, garlic braised shoulder, mustard spaetzle, summer squash: roasted garlic tastes and smells great. Meat are tender.[3.5]  Third course: Lemon glazed donut holes: sour, sweet. [3.5] Freezing strawberry soup: use liquid nitrogen to freeze and dehydrate fruits. Interesting[4] Macaroons: good taste.[3.5]

I tried several dishes with my friends. the number in [] is the star. Highest is 5. Soupe: Roasted red bell pepper soup: sweet, full-bodied, buttery(cream or cheese), savory [4].   Wild mushroom soup: full-bodied, oily, greasy, strong.  Too much for me. [3.5] Plat de r√©sistance: Filet of salmon: crispy fried, salty, good fish. [3.5] Smoked Truffle-Infused Filet Mignon: can feel the truffle, but average taste. good decor. [3] Smoked salmon sandwich: I believed the bread and bacon are too crispy and tough, with a thicker source. Should only include veggie and fish, with light source to emphasize salmon taste. [3] Dessert: Chocolate mousse tower: well design, which its chef learnt from Julia Child. Taste smooth, sweet, crispy chocolate tower crust and rich source. [5] Gateau marjolaine: smooth, with iced mousse, combined with hazelnut, praline, and coffee flavor. [5]

Six of us try Petite Maison during Arizona Restaurant week.  It was nice to sit outside in their patio, some trees with sunshine and view of the moon. For the dishes, we ordered both all tasting menu and other regulars ones.  Definitely try Char sui pork jowls: smooth, salty, fat but not oily. Come with barbecued flavor and sweet taste. [5] Tartare: I kind of like it. A nice combination with raw beef, capers, parsley to give a sour taste to cover beef. Use parsley to mix with beef to bring some juice and make it refreshing. Beef itself is tasty. [5] Foie gras with roasted plum jam: our favorite. Sweet, a little salty, full bodied, fatty tastes. [5] Queue de Boeuf: a well seasoned oxtail. Rich and a little salty to give a balanced favor. [4.5] Hudson valley foie gras torchon: when I had my first bite, I feel I had a high quality chocolate melted in my mouth or a butter melted on a hot iron surface. Taste not strong, with pure torchon flavor, rich and a little too fatty. [4] Moules: the soup is full-bodied, best eat with bread. mussels have their fishy smell. [4]  Escargots: come with a little portion, tender, Q texture. [3.75]  Soft shell crab tempura: a good tempura, the shell is really soft and crab fresh. But not that special. [3.5] Sea bass: bass is good, but not too much taste. [3] Roasted lamb leg: no muttony odour, meat is little tough to eat. [3]  Wine pairing is also very nice, we tried four different wines. I suggest you try dishes over [4].

I have to say this is my best Arizona Restaurant Week experience. The food, design, environment are all really good. Suggest to come in around 6pm and choose the table near window, which have a kind of private small hall for 6 people. I would suggest this restaurant to any friend who like to try Italian food with a nice environment and pleasant experience.   Sides: Crispy pig ears: I will definitely recommend it. Sour from white vinegar. Crispy but not oily from stripped fried pig ears. Spicy from red sliced pepper. The end, add some chopped green onion on the top. A nice starter. 5 Creamy Polenta: creamy taste, not sweet or salty. The cornmeal tastes friendly to Chinese, for we also eat a lot in the north part of China. 3.5  First course: Crudo Albacore with green apples green apples, black garlic and truffle oil: peak color fish with tender texture. You can definitely small the truffle oil, wonderful taste. 4.5 Butterfish with tomato arugula: although some people feel butterfish should not consider to be a fish, but I like its texture - sticky to teethes. Sweet, salty and rich. 4 Local seasonal lettuces and veggies with house made vinaigrette: Fresh feeling, nothing that impressive3 Fresh Mozzarella with olive oil poached tomatoes: first time to try Mozzarella, interesting feeling, soft, tender and light. Nice combination gives different layers of feeling.3.5  Second course: Riotto with Squid Ink, Tomatoes and Tuna: one of my favorites. Dark soup with risotto to absorb all flavors, combining with some chili pepper to give the overall rich and smooth feeling some exciting spikes. 5 Gnocchi A La Testa Pork Rapini: the bitter rapini does taste like a Chinese vegetable Chinese Kai-lan. Gnocchi is also very familiar to me.3.5 Short Rib with crisp potatoes and truffle vinaigrette: the meat on the rib is really tasty. Tender, sticky, sweet and salty. Truffle gives a more pleasant smell.4.5 Butterfish with roasted carrot and Salsa Verde and polenta: the white fish combine with green sauce gives a nice picture. Salsa Verde contains parsley, vinegar, capers, garlic, onion, anchovies and olive oil. Most of its flavor is from parsley. 3.5  Third course: dessert by Tracy Dempsey Olive oil cake with berry compote and ricotta:good but not impressive 3 Salted orange caramel and chocolate Budino: very tasty, smooth, creamy and rich.4

It has good Szechuan flavor food. Try the "pork lungs in chili sauce" and "boiled pork", These are my favorites. Best is to point the Chinese names"",""
