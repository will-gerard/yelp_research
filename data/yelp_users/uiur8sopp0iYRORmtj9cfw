Every time I come in here, I find high-ticket items for cheap that suit my style preference and size...I have found Stacy Adams loafers for $20, Steve Madden shoes for $15, polo dress shirts for $12. Just found a Bugatchi Uomo Italian dress shirt for $14 the other day (I'm sure normally like $80 or so). This is my favorite place to buy clothes, bar none. Much of the stuff is in very good to almost new condition. Oops...now I've let the cat out of the bag, and there's going to be a run on the place. Damn! No, just kidding... I'm happy to share. Hope y'all find the joy in clothes shopping as I have with Well Suited.

I have to add to the chorus of 5-stars...My g/f and I were here a couple of weeks ago, and sat out on the deck of Geordie's sipping happy hour martinis and cosmos the likes of which only "The Mansion" can serve up. Our server was ultra-friendly and helpful as we soaked up one of the best views in the Valley. We had the pomme frites as a shared appetizer with some kind of bleu cheese topping - c'est magnifique! Cost was very doable. We also enjoyed wandering around the place learning the history of this beautifully and authentically preserved gem of Phoenix. Go as soon as you can, and yes - call ahead to make sure they aren't closed for a special event.

I dined here recently with my girlfriend for AZ restaurant week. We had a specially memorable evening, as everything was perfect, or just near. The wines we chose in the wine flights were particularly palatable, as was the food (though they lost points when the server had no idea about a couple of wines we asked about). The appetizers were nice little meals on their own - she had the lobster in lettuce cups, I the Ahi tuna Tartar stack, which was nice, sans the tortilla chips instead of...toast points, maybe? I had the cioppino for entree, which, for a seafood lover like me, was just sheer bliss. My date had the tilapia, which we both thought was a tad on the "swampy" side, though it was still edible enough. We finished with key lime pie for her, and the chocolate s'more souffle pour moi, which we both gobbled with the abandon only dedicated gourmands can know. All in all, a wonderful evening. Our dinner came to close to $90, but I felt it was worth it.   One of the nits we had was the decor, once the lights started to come up at the end of the night. Steamers, you need new chairs and tables. We thought they looked like they belonged at Golden Corral, not in an otherwise opulently decorated space with old world ambience. Luckily, we reserved a booth.

My g/f and I LOVE THIS PLACE. For starters, they are always friendly, smiling and helpful, which is an absolute anomaly these days. At Southern and Dobson, it's semi-close to where we live (and they deliver). Their Massaman Curry must be tried by anyone wanting the best of this stripped-down joint (they now have tables for dine-in). It's Chinese/Thai oriented, for those who want something maybe in both of those worlds, and want it fast, delicious and (relatively) cheap.   We always get the side order of crab puffs (you get like 10 of them! or maybe we do, for ordering them so religiously!), which are just a little slice of heaven on earth in comfort food. The shrimp in lobster sauce is also a scrumptuous choice. Grab a Thai iced tea as well, to round out an outstanding dining experience. Good for run-in and carry out, dine-in, or delivery, Szechuan Express is west Mesa's little gem of Asian cuisine tastiness! Thank you SE staff for your excellence!

Set up what was advertised as $19.99/month internet + phone service, made sure with sales rep that it was indeed that exact deal, then set it up, last November. I have had nothing but headaches, hassles, overcharges, long waits on hold talking to people (now 8 months on a total of about 15 different reps) about fixing my inaccurate bills pricing me way over the coupon rate I initially got. Finally, in like March I got a sympathetic character in the phone (most reps have horrible customer service skills) - Maria is her name, bless her - and she finally did me a solid and got the bill to successively reflect what I originally set up the account as. Perhaps I should give an extra star for that, but the 4 straight months of calling and hassles (averaging about 1-2 long calls/wk.) is time i can't get back in my life. Also, like other reviewers have cited, even though I have a premium package (13 mbps download speed), it loads like dial up much of the time, with lots of page time outs and times where I'm thinking "Hello? I have Internet service, right? What am I paying for?"  Cox, you need to figure it out and do your customers right and quit acting like the communications tyrant that you currently do...Also, your right hand (customer service) needs to know what the left hand (sales) is doing, so you don't waste valued customers' time and money. Thanks!

I work near this Sprouts, and stop in to grab lunch items about twice a week, on average. Like other reviewers have noted, the deli is outstanding, and if you can't wait for a made-to-order sandwich, they have plenty of wrapped deli items ready to go in the cold case. They usually have great sale prices on drinks, too, so you can do pretty well getting sandwich, chips and a drink for around $5-$6 - if you're not in a Subway mood, or want to skip long lines or sit-down lunches (they do have several tables, though, if you want it "for here"). Their staff is always courteous and helpful, as well. Thanks, Sprouts!

This place is right down the street from my new office, and thank goodness! They have a wide range of baked goods, including gourmet breads and pastries, cookies, and other goodies (even fresh hummus!), as well as great iced tea and other drinks. I walked down there today and got a wonderfully delicious sandwich on their fresh 9-grain bread, along with chips and a drink for under $8. The staff and owner are all friendly, the place is charming and has dine-in seating indoors or on the patio, and they make it fast and fresh. Thanks, Bread Basket! You guys are awesome. I'll be coming in more often for sure.

I've got to add to the chorus of one and two-star reviews for this place. Another Scottsdale establishment that's faaaaar too pricey and waaaay too full of itself to justify the median price of $11 for margaritas (mine was served in a small, 10 oz. glass, and was mediocre. And don't even get me started on the food menu - which I gladly passed on, though I could have eaten).   The atmosphere in the daytime is blah to average at best, with a gaggle of servers all congregating and giggling amongst themselves too busily to distract for something called..."service". And, servers? Listen up...never, ever address your valued customers as "buddy," or 'bud". It's plain condescending. That's "sir", or the name on my gold card. And your server's salary is much too jeopardized to be smirking your way through your Tom Cruise in Cocktail trying-to-impress-the-girls-not-the-customers fantasy...okay, bud? That's why you got a 12% tip tonight. Oooooh, I know it hurts, but you need to shape up and read a book called "Customer Service for Beginners", grow up and step into the real world, bud.  Alternative to night out at Douche Factory: grab some Fresh and Easy tortilla chips and awesome restaurant-style salsa, a sixer of Corona, some fajita fixins and a friend, and settle in for an actually ENJOYABLE evening - all for about a fifth of the cost (or less) of this sorry-ass place.

I thought that I've had a pretty good thing going here, up until this summer when noticeably the place has started to slip. Things like not being able to use the BBQs, laundry facilities due to out of order machines, and pool water that's 95 degrees (not much of a cool off!) and non-functioning spas all make me want to write a remonstrative letter to the property mgmt company, in light of their jacking up the rent for, obviously, no reason.  A $30 rate increase/mo. + tax is hardly justified, as there is nothing value-added to go with it.  If anything, the rents should come down! I will probably look elsewhere for lodgings, though I'm not crazy about uprooting yet again. I love this location, but they're fleecing their loyal customers who pay them to have functional facilities, which have deteriorated. Get things back into proper working order, and I'll think about staying.

if you enjoy being inconvenienced for imaginary cockroach problems, unfriendly customer service, unsubstantiated and arbitrary rent increases, hot pools, broken BBQs, faulty A/C (I went 2 hellish nights in June and July w/o it because of mechanical problems), then be their guest. Yes, the location is nice, but they have an overinflated sense of their own chic-ness (probably just because they're technically located in Scottsdale), and act like everyone in the world wants to live here, and that's probably why 2 rent increases in a year and a half. They just want your $$$, they're not interested in giving outstanding service. The maintenance guys and Bob are nice, though. Rent at your own risk.

Yes, they are great at Happy Hour, with their margaritas and taco plates and endless chips and salsa, but I also came in for dinner with a friend, and they were super friendly, prompt, and in my favorite setting for Mexican food in the Valley. Yes, it's about a mile from my house, so love the Civic Center location as well. I trust a place that's been operating continuously for like, 65 years, as well (unheard of nowadays!). Fantastic ambiance, service, and food--thanks, Los Olivos!

I've been here 3 or 4 times before and the service is always spotty to non-existent, with the added insult of unfriendly staff. We came in last Saturday and sat there for at least a full 10-15 mins. before I went up to the bar to politely see about getting some table service. How does the bartender reply to one of his valued patrons? "Oh, yeah, are you at the table with the other guy glaring at me? You're supposed to wait to be seated."  No kidding.   In all the times I've EVER been in there was no hostess service, let alone a "please wait to be seated sign". Plus, it's so dark in there they can't see you anyway! We had to read the table menu by iPhone light.  So, when the waitress finally does show up, is she apologetic, congenial...friendly in any fashion (not that I really expected her to be)? I re-iterate that we'd been waiting quite a while, and she snidely, rudely comes back with, "Well, you should have waited to be seated. Or perhaps you shouldn't be served at all."  Once again, no kidding, folks. We'd had a couple of glasses across the street, but were very much in control of our faculties. Since when does complaining or commenting about being ignored equate to "non-servableness"? And a COMPLETELY rude and uncalled for tone towards the customer???  Is it any wonder in the world that your waitstaff gets told off and your full-of-itself establishment written off, when YOU create these situations through incompetence?   Skip Kazimierz and head to AZ Wine Co., Atlas Bistro, Citizen Public House, and AZ88 where the staff are fun, friendly, competent, and know what great service is all about.

Was just in tonight and sat at their sushi bar and had the Tootsie Roll platter. Very nice for a fast food joint. Chelsea is the manager, and she's really great, as is the rest of the staff. Gonna have to come back and try something else soon. Plus it's right down the street from my house.

Wow, I am surprised at how far this place has gone downhill! I came in here the other night after not being in for a while, and for how dead they were (every time I go in here, the place is dead, so--how are they staying in business?), the service was inexcusably slow. Isn't this supposed to be "fast food"? The manager was unresponsive to my comment to that effect. There was also a cockroach just inside the front door, so maybe the health department should get involved. Also, just yesterday I hit Whole Foods' sushi bar, and for about the same price got a truly fresh product, so I won't be going back into Tokyo anytime soon.

Condescension is never, ever a good or acceptable customer service policy. Ever. Hey, Andy Dick lookin' pimply bastard - you didn't get the clue when I tossed it right back atcha there when I entered your sad, "we're just kind of hanging on and paying to keep the lights on" store, "buddy"??? Your Hispanic co-worker gal is nice. She gets 4 stars.  But people like you who cockily and irritatingly regard every person who comes in the door of your pathetic life as a Schlotsky's schmuck with nothing but mindless contempt shouldn't be anywhere near the front lines of ANY business. Jerks like you are a big reason why people stop going out to eat - you belong out back scrubbing or mopping something - only. The fact that you had to get in that last little desperate, passive-aggressively hostile and poison-to-a-healthy-customer-vendor-relationship - "buddy" sealed your doom as a one star loser.  I'm heading down the street to the newly-opened Paradise Bakery next time I'm in your obnoxious vicinity, guy.   Oh, and your food is overpriced for what it is.  Manager, please take note!

Ate here with a friend tonight, and it was very, very good. Service was friendly and attentive, food was excellent, atmosphere relaxing and stimulating. It's a bit pricier than the rest of the Valley, being in Scottsdale, but it's well worth it. Well situated, next door to the SMOCA in the Civic Center.

This place is WAYYYY too full of itself and substandard to receive anything more than a single star rating. First off, their ID checkers have the arrogance and attitude of New York club bouncers - Hey fellas, don't flatter yourselves, it's a crappy dive bar (just because you get some low-end Scottsdale yuppies as regulars doesn't mean you're big time, K?). Thought they were bouncing at Studio 54 or something...  Next up, the last two times I lowered my standards and entered this place I GOT NO SERVICE. AT ALL. I stood/sat up at the inside bar for a full 5 mins. once, and like a minute the next time, and said "Fuck this place. I'm never coming back here". Then, when I went to leave, I had to go through a phalanx of overly self-important security goons, and basically told them off. It's kind of a shame, too, because this place is like a 10 min. walk from my house. No, on second thought, it's no shame at all. For me. The shame is on them.   Whatever!

Came in today after work and friendly Matt the bartender was spot-on, which had me re-thinking this place. Yes, they are pricey, but damn it all if their pub atmosphere isn't just about perfect. I've tried their grilled cheese sandwich and bread pudding which were remarkable, and they have great beers on tap, so I know I will probably make this place a more regular stop, as it is directly on my way home from work, and I can forgive the initial oversight in my first review.  A great place to chill from the summer heat!

Yeah, I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers here that the lines of communication and general attitude here are pretty awful. I read on some other site about someone experiencing bait-and-switch style tactics here, which I felt these guys tried to do, though I held their feet to the fire and went to their top financing guy, and he worked with me and was very nice, and I ended up getting a better deal, which is the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of one.   One question, Chapman sales staff (and mgmt.): Why hurry to "close deals" (in the guise of a peppy "We really want to get this deal done for you and get you out the door in your brand new car!") and promise a deal that you can't backup until you get the final word from the bank??? Stop giving people the erroneous idea that it's a done deal when you drive away. My experience was, a few days after the sale, I get the "It's gonna be another $2,000 down and blah blah blah at this rate for you to keep this car..." etc. And when I protested nicely, saying, "Can you work with me here?" the salesman walks me to the back lot and shows me a completely different car make and goes, "You can buy this one with your credit (not having any credit cards or open lines of credit in the last 2 years constitutes "bad credit")...or I can give you your old car back and we can say goodnight" kind of rudely, and I was left flabbergasted that he didn't get the facts squared away from the bank before letting me fall in love with the VW Jetta he hurredly put me in (Yes, he picked the right car for me, it is awesome, but still...). Just be honest with people and say, "we need to hear back from the bank till it's a done deal". People appreciate honesty and won't necessarily run away if you are, but unfortunately most understand deception is part of the car salesman game.    And yeah, the VW service dept. people are incredibly condescending. I even got called "buddy" which is plain insulting in that situation. It's "Sir," guys. Wake up and learn some customer service skills, K?  I'm afraid I would not recommend this place to anyone looking to buy a car, obviously (unless you have thick skin, are an experienced car buyer, and have a take-no-shit-from-car-salesman attitude, because they do have some great cars), so...take a look at your Yelp rating, guys. Everyone thinks you suck!  @Scout S.: I too test drove a Jeep Liberty, and it was on empty, too!  @Annemarie L.: I wish I'd checked the reviews online, too. I probably would have gone to Tempe Autoplex instead, where my g/f bought her Honda and has never had a problem.

I gave them 2 stars initially, as Brian their main finance guy worked with me to get me what I thought was a fair deal, so I gave them an extra star.   They put a GPS tracking device on my car - which failed, like a week later, and left me stranded 17 miles from home. I had to wait 3 hours for a tow truck out in Mesa. (The device also allows your car to start - acting, so they say, like a theft-deterrent device. Well, I couldn't steal my own car home that night, which was a ROYAL pain in the ass.)   Also, their finance department told me they have auto-withdraw (so I wouldn't risk an overdue payment) but it turns out they don't have it set up yet. It was a major reason I did the deal. Big thumbs down for that, and the fact that they charge $4.00 for any credit/debit card transactions. I've never, ever heard of anyone charging to charge you (especially for a debit card). What a racket.  Everything down the line with this place has been a snafu. Their in-house finance department, CAG, is rude and unhelpful. Avoid financing with them at all costs. This place reinforces the idea in my head that car sales is a big racket, designed to squeeze buyers for all they can, letting good customer relations slide on by as they get busy counting the money, and "selling the loans" to quote their own rep. (Note to everyone: Check all online reviews first before you buy a car, to get the REAL story...)  Happy motoring, everybody!

I have been coming here since 2008, and I have to say...it's all good, every time! The service is always friendly and outstanding, which goes miles with me...but add to that such a great, unique and tasty menu that non-vegetarians like me are swayed to eat veg. I mean, vegan po' boys, kung pao, coconut curry, garden burgers, meatball sandwiches--all of which are tastier than the so-called "real things". I had the spicy bbq chicken sandwich with a side of curry pasta salad today, which rocked, and with a friend who hadn't been in yet, and who, I'm sure, will be back. May I also suggest the thyme fries, which are a bit of awesome. I don't care about the so-called "scenesters" that one reviewer was complaining about. I like that they replaced the standard soda fountain with a lineup of kombucha, Izze, and other healthy drinks. I just eat happily and enjoy myself here, and notice that everyone else is generally doing exactly the same.  Go Green!

This place is probably the cheapest middle eastern food in town. I love it. If you're on a shoestring (read ASU students), then you can have a meal here for under $5. I suggest the falafel sandwich (about $2.75, and filling) and maybe an order of babaganouj if you're looking for a complementary side. Delicious.

My g/f and I ate here last year and it was, plain and simply,  AWFUL. We got there about an hour before closing and they basically ignored us. The veggies on our plates resembled the kind of stuff you find in those cheap frozen Bird'sEye packages with the square-cut carrots. The sauces were extremely bland. The service? Non-existent. Don't ever go, as I believe closing time or not, the food and place is a terrible waste of money and time. Go to Royal Taj or The Dhaba instead, to experience something closer to the term "satisfaction".

I've been in a handful of times, and last night was also no disappointment. After looking for a place to have a glass of wine late, I ended up here, as 3 or 4 other places in Old Town were either closed (Napoleon's and Tapas Papas Fritas both closed at 11 PM??? Well, Napoleon's closed forever, so I heard, but won't believe...) or dead. Citizen had a multi-course private affair they were finishing up. Kazimierz had some kind of themed jazz party going and was raucous and demanded a cover charge. But good ol' cosmopolitan-cool AZ88 was next on my list, where I had a fantastic Pinot Noir (and Tempranillo), cheese plate (their kitchen stays open till 12:30 every night), and warm and friendly convo with spot-on bartender Steen. Another bartender came in later and was relating his favorite summer drinks in a bon vivant fashion. They do have a killer Moscow Mule which is served in a copper tankard to keep it cool.   I've been coming in here, on average maybe once or twice a year since around 2007, and let me say at AZ88 the good things don't change. They still have a tantalizing food menu (they are a full boar upscale restaurant), and a drink menu that, together, rival anything else, really, in Lower Scottsdale (and in much of the Valley). Not to mention the atmosphere that for me has the perfect combination of sophistication, decor, music (4 more stars for the DJ's mellow-ambient rhythms) service, and vibe that indulges all the senses wonderfully. I'm now making this place my default destination for treating myself or a date like VIPs, as they've shown what it takes to to be among the best at what they do.

On Saturday, Feb. 20, Changing Hands hosted what they probably thought would be a manageable little Ozzy Osbourne book signing. Fat chance! What were they thinking? On the phone early that afternoon I was told only, "Hurry up and reserve a copy, they're going fast". Was I told there would be thousands of people there, and that they'd already sold 2,000 books by 9 A.M., and that they were having supply problems? Was I told the line would be THREE HOURS LONG in cold, rainy weather, and they, most likely, were going to run out of books, even for those who bought a ticket/book? No, every indication they gave, all the way down the queue, mind you, was that there are plenty of books, you'll get one. Ha! What a lie! Changing Hands bit off WAY MORE than it could chew having Ozzy book sign at their store. In short, their staff was a rude bunch of liars, and the way we poor Ozzy disciples were treated was beyond deplorable. It was simply uncalled for treating us like misbehaving schoolchildren, and I hope everyone else who was there and froze their asses off in the rain only to get treated like shit and get a post card for Ozzy to scribble on (Ozzy is great btw, he'll be here long after Changing hands) Yelp their minds here too, and show how Changing Hands' staff gets when the heat gets turned up. For seven years now, I've gone out of my way to patronize them, over the big chain stores, but...why should I? I hope they go under, the jerks. See you at Bookman's.

I love drifting and browsing through this place looking for great book, CD, and DVD titles. It's one of the standout things that makes me really enjoy living in this neighborhood. Like other reviewers have cited - you can grab a comfy easy chair by the windows and read and gaze out onto the plaza, or a private meeting room if you need to really concentrate. And their bookstore is well worth mentioning: small as it is, they get in some real gems from time to time, at a fraction of the price compared to typical discount/used bookstores.     My one nit to pick with the place is in regard to the people who seem to have no care or concern that they are in a library and need to keep quiet. This includes loud groups of kids who sometimes bustle through, and these loud cell phone talkers. Hey people, take it outside! The only reason I've cited this in my review is that the library staff seems to have no care to quieten these people. Please, library staff, take note (your service to us courteous customers overall is outstanding, btw - thank you)!

This place has a great selection, plus you can sit at their bar and drink for half the price you would at the typical Scottsdale wine bar. This is the place for those dedicated winos who sometimes want to sidestep the chain stores and buy completely locally.  There are wines here which aren't available anywhere else. The Atlas Bistro next door allows BYOB and the menu is simply fabulous. 4.5 stars.

So, I initially gave these guys (officially) a 4-star review. That was before I had dinner here, made to gastronomic perfection at Atlas Bistro next door. So far I've had the spectacular Caraway Rye Sausage with homemade gnocchi, and last night the Lobster mushrooms with sourdough crostini, and the most divine aioli sauce known to man. These guys are unique, and a gift to Epicurean delights. Where else can you buy anything in the shop, sit down and drink it at the bar, and order (quite affordable) 5-star offerings? Nowhere I know of. I've been all over the U.S. and Europe, and this place sits in a class all it's own.

I agree that this place has gotten a thrifty store feel to it. I'd much rather go to a library bookstore, or better yet Half Price Books, which is made more for the frugal bibliophile. I've gotten some okay selections here over the years, but it's starting to get a desperate bus stop vibe. The new coffeeshop, though, is a good addition.

TM is a handy one-stop shop for all manner of household, clothing, foodstuffs, garden and patio, even games, travel items, and handy gadgets like you would find at Sharper Image. The store is indeed a cross between Sharper Image, Bed, Bath and Beyond, and say, like a Big Lots, only on a much smaller scale. I like ducking in here when I want to pick up a new pair of discount dress socks, and maybe a high-end discounted condiment, cooking utensil, stemware, bedding, cookbook, etc. You get the idea...a very eclectic, tasteful selection of goods, usually discounted from what you would buy it for at the aforementioned stores.

Just rode in there the other day, as my trail bike needed a tune-up, and Tribe came highly recommended. Without hesitation, one guy picks my bike up, sprays some lubricant on the chain, adjusts some screws, test rides it, and within 5-10 mins. I was back on and riding again like brand new. Damage? Free of charge (I fully expected to pay, believe me). These guys are friendly, obviously knowledgeable, fast, and more than fair. They know good PR, and have a great lineup of bikes, from what I saw. They get my future business for sure, as I'm looking to buy a good street bike in the near future. Thank you, Tribe staff!

This last June I took my car here to get front brake pads and rotors, as well as a new fuel pump. They quoted me over $1,000 at first, and I had them try to come down off that price. He - this guy Van - got back quickly and brought that quote down by nearly 300, saying "I can shop around for a cheaper distributor". Wow! I thought. These guys are great. Fast forward to the day after getting all that work done and my now squeaky brake problem. Never have my brakes squeaked before - I've always kept the brakes in good condition. So, I call and relate my new problem. Cheaper distributor apparently means faulty product. He says bring it in next Tues. and we'll look at it. I come in Tues. "We can't fit you in." I drove from Mesa, mind you, as my car had broken down in N. Phoenix. Okay, we make an appt. for Thurs. I come in Thurs. They finally drive the car after 45 min.  Long story short, he basically calls me a liar, that my brakes aren't squeaking. I say, "Are new brakes supposed to squeak? Are you calling me a liar? They squeak. I want them replaced, or my money back." So the jerk disappears for 2 or 3 hours, says nothing to me, then hands me my keys and says, "There you go." "What did you guys do?" "You got new pads and rotors, isn't that what you wanted?" he says, all snide. "Yeah, you could tell me what's going on. Thanks." I've never had such poor auto service in my life. I only give them a star for actually doing what they needed to do to make good (even though he was a complete jackass about it) and not totally shirking me. Awful. I'll never go back there.

Been in a few times, because it's close to my house. Service is spotty. Food is mediocre, and probably designed to be more enjoyable the drunker you are. My friend and I won the trivia game thing one night (the trivial girl totally came up and interrupted our conversation to tell us about it - we weren't ostensibly there for that). So, t-girl comes up and hands us the big $25 gift card for the brainiac winners, and I say, "Looks like we're the smartest guys in the joint," like...not-so-serious, but in a playful way, to which she gives the most condescending look, and replies, "I don't know about that," all straight-faced, turning away robotically. Wow. Creepy. Yeah, you don't know me, or the art of conversation, girlfriend. I could clean up on Jeopardy, but since you interrupted...okay, I'll play your little game. And get comped food and drinks for me and my friend in the process. Boo-yah!  Anyway, my buddy gets the beef tacos and swears by them. I guess they have a couple of okay appetizers not designed for Epicurean appreciation, but for wolfing down while you're watching the Suns game.  There's your Max Sports Grille trivia in a nutshell!

Gotta give this store a major FAIL. Starting yesterday, when I purchased 4 of their 5 oz. party packs of wine goblets, and the girl mistakenly didn't see my Bev Mo card sitting atop them, then proceeded to ask me if I had a phone number for the account, my confusion began, I'm going "Um, why do you need that?" She said something vague, like "Just in case." So, give her my current number. Nope. So, I go to make the purchase, and say, "So, my card didn't go through, or something?" And she goes, "Oh...what? Oh, I thought that was just some card..." Really??? Are your employees really this incompetent? Then, I take my wine goblets to my wine tasting event, where I would say only 20% of the bases actually fit and stayed on the cups. So, most of the time, they are loose and unable to attach, or flying off, then I eventually just poured the wine saying, "Sorry I bought these from Bev Mo, and the bases don't stay on" and hand them a baseless cup. So unprofessional and bad looking for us both, don't you think, Bev? Really sucked.  Fast forward to today, when I call and Jennifer answers and I explain to her my problem. Do I get an "Oh, we're awfully sorry for your inconvenience, sir"? No. Yes, she explained that I would be able to get my money back if I brought them back, but since I have another wine tasting event in Chandler in about 2 hours, and this Bev Mo is way the hell north of me, and I don't have time to run them 10 mi. N. to get my money back then go buy some somewhere else, and that I will have to spend another 3 hour event pouring samples into glasses without a base on them, and how bad this looks for Bev Mo, as yes, I am telling them all where I bought them and that they are faulty - do I get an apology then? No, just an "Oh, okay...". Silence.  Jesus, I am so sick of explaining good customer service to you people! Ever heard of a simple (real) apology, or a "make good"? Really, I should get all of my $43 or so back so you can keep a customer (for other products).  I will now be ordering my wine cups in bulk off of Amazon or find another place locally to buy them. Learn customer service and retention, please. I just hope "Jennifer" is not your store manager, or that place is in serious jeopardy!

Yes, they are a tad on the pricey side, and they do seem to be hit and miss, judging by the reviews, but for me, last night it was all hit: Samosas  not quite flaky enough but very tasty; superb mushroom mattar cooked to perfection; and garlic naan bread that was oh so fresh, warm, and delicious. I only had to wait 10 mins. for a to-go order, and I sat at their bar, which was a good place to chill in itself. I'd been in once before w/ my g/f about 2 yrs. ago, and I would have given it 3 stars then, plus maybe a bonus half star for the atmosphere. Very dark, woodsy and well decorated. A nice spot to bring a date or grab scrumptious Indian cuisine to go (on one of their good days)!

Yeah, this place is one of the kickinest joints in the 'dale. I've always had a great time here with my buddies the Ryans, and even came here solo one night and had fun doing a couple of sakebombers, a little sushi, a few legendary rockers adorning the walls...this place has that right mix of hipness, cool waitstaff, reasonable prices, and great ambiance. This really is the perfect place to get your group on and have some laughs while chillin' Japanese-style.

Pattie's is ok, for an Old Town, neighborhood dive bar, but...$4 for a bottle of Sam Adams? Really?? I know, I know...it's Scottsdale. But still. Get over yourselves. The night I paid that for my Sam's (yes, I went through with it and paid that much), I think there was one other person there - an old man in the corner. Seriously. No music, or entertainment. The place was dead. I thought, "get over yourselves," chugged my Sam's and left to go find civilization - after contemplating telling the bartender where to stick his Sam's (he's actually a really nice guy, so I let it go, but he actually asked if I wanted change from a 5. Uh, yeah, dude). $2.50 tops for that, Pattie's. The fooseball tables and fireplace can't save this one.

Came here tonight to The Living Room and ordered an Irish Coffee. Gal behind the bar seemed unsure...had to go get some other guy to go in the back to get the coffee. Okay, whatever, but that took 5 minutes, she presents me with a to-go coffee cup, takes off the lid and proceeds to pour less than half a shot of Bailey's in it..."there you go". Really? An Irish Coffee, my dear, is Bailey's, Whiskey, and coffee. What she brought me was hours-old coffee with no discernible Bailey's at all. I tell her what's in an Irish Coffee. "Oh, I put some Bailey's in it." "Could you throw a shot of Jameson's in that for me, please? And, I've never seen it served this way before." "Oh, how do you get it?" "Usually in a glass mug. I'd like that for here." That took another few minutes while coffee guy searched for a mug. Sheesh!   She was nice, but...really? I was just surprised, as that is an all-too-common drink. $10! 2 points for bartendership. I like the chillax atmosphere, though.

Wow! This tour really scared the pants off of us. If you like REAL scares, and not some hoodoo voodoo made up "horror" rubbish, then by all means, do the Auld Reekie tour. They take you down to the Edinburgh underground, where it's dark and dank and full of malevolent ghosts (supposedly), and where hundreds died as a result of homelessness, indifference, fires, genocides and all kinds of evils. Even the hardiest soul will flinch when they get you in the cold dungeon-like atmosphere and tell you wicked stories of murder and pernicious hauntings. There was a crescendoing moment there when I was sure people were going to faint dead away or have heart attacks. After the scares, you're ushered into a neighboring pub which completes the spooky atmosphere...all in all, a pretty incredible piece of Edinburgh history, and well worth the price of admission.

Fantastic ambiance, with low lighting in classic Spanish architectural-style building. Had the Green Chile Duck Confit paired with an Argentine Pinot Noir (both utterly delectable). I finished with the incredible Pumpkin Bread Pudding! Unparalleled service from Hannah. 5 stars all the way.

This is just about as good as it gets. Friendly, attentive staff, chic-but-not-snotty upscale atmosphere; great menu...and about a mile from my house, so I can walk there. Stopped in Saturday afternoon for some take-away chow. Syrina exemplifies outstanding service. Loved the Mahi Club. Very nice, Daily Dose!

My favorite place to recreate in the Valley. This truly is the Central Park of Phoenix/Scottsdale, with its 22 miles of trails reaching from Shea down to (and around) Tempe Town Lake (if you include the Tempe trails the Greenbelt is attached to). My one nit to pick is with those who don't know the proper usage of a multi-use trail: stay to the right unless passing, people! I can't count the number of times people jump as if affrighted by a ghost when I call out "passing on your left" and who yank doggies out of the way and freak out...take it easy folks! Just know that on days without inclement or burning-hot weather, there are going to be hundreds of people enjoying the trail - by all sorts of modes of transportation.  See you out soaking up the sun and beauty on the Greenbelt!

Yeah, i pretty much have to concur with Patrick that Scottsdale road crews and administration of road repair funds seems like a random bunch of irrational nonsense. Totally with you on the whole "finish one project before starting another", and it's 3PM and lanes are blocked off but workers and any sign of work are seemingly non-existent. It's funny how the same roads get torn up about every year or two, only to leave shoddy workmanship and ugly patchwork scars. At least, if you're going to inconvenience us for weeks and months at a time, have the work ethic and common courtesy to leave the roadway surface in as good (or, preferably better) shape than before you started digging. Please. Oh, and Scottsdale police? I reserve the right to swerve around shoddy, crappy roadwork that the city either ignores or patched up and left worse, and not have it called "negligent driving." We the people cite YOU the city for negligent, mismanaged chaos which not only inconveniences, but in some cases damages vehicle alignments and front-ends as we dodge and amble through this urban miasma of ineptitude.   Here's an idea: How about making road surfaces out of materials that don't break down every couple of years? Oh, I forgot - we're spending our trillions on unnecessary warfare and waste. Remember, Rome fell partly because it couldn't build viable roads.

Was in last night and Mary - who's like the sun shining at night - warmed the room with her smile, attentiveness and sweet demeanor, making my list of favorite servers anywhere. Had 2 Stellas and their oh so unique Reuben egg rolls with 1,000 Island dip. Uh...yum? Good place to watch the game - or variety of games, that is - and mingle with locals. Lots of "regular Joes" and friendly people. I like.

Gotta love this place if you're a wine or beer connoisseur, as the selection surpasses everything else out there. Where else can you find very enjoyable Cotes du Rhone and Burgundy wines (as well as great CA wines) for well under $20??? Costco may undercut them price-wise on a few things, and yes they do have the incredible Kirkland and Cameron Hughes brands, but TW&M has consistency and variety (as well as available, knowledgeable staff) on their side. Great selections on all varietals and all viticultural regions of the world. Their free wine tastings (and occasional liquor samplings) also make it the go-to place for libation aficionados. I always get a warm and fuzzy feeling coming in here. They also have a not too shabby liquor and mixing beverage section, every kind of beer or ale you can think of, and all kinds of miscellanious beverage paraphernalia/implements and other goods. Plus, they have like 5 or 6 locations now all over the Valley, so you don't have to travel too far across town to get to one anymore!

I've been coming here for about a year now for discount literature, and great reference and textbooks. Their staff is eminently friendly and helpful, they have rare editions of classics, a great used music and DVD section, and even free gourmet coffee. It's definitely worth the drive into Central Phoenix - all the more because it's within a few blocks of Trader Joe's, Total Wine & More, Duck and Decanter, and about 2 dozen other great stores where I can make a beautiful little shopping spree out of it if need be! The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I have been able to find a few selections in more pristine condition and at a much better discount at the Scottsdale Civic Center Library's bookstore (but they don't have near the selection that Half Price does).

I have to say, in the 9 years or so that I have continued, for some reason, to use Verizon as my wireless phone company, that their overall report card would be about a C- or D. I can't count the number of dropped calls, missed calls (many of them important personal and business calls), and now bait and switch tactics that I find to be the nail in the coffin for me continuing to employ Verizon at all. I was promised a "free upgrade" to the iPhone 4S back in Jan. 2011, effective Sept. 2012, a fact which was made clear by Verizon reps, and embedded in clear language on the My Verizon part of my online account. Now, as I go to verify the details of that "free upgrade", I am told in no uncertain terms by a rep that "No, we've never offered that, you'll have to pay for that phone and the upgrade fee of $30".   Case in point, Verizon are a bunch of racketeering charlatans who deserve a massive class action lawsuit due to their shoddy phone service, poor customer service, empty bait-and-switch promises (lies), litany of missed and dropped calls, and more. I hate that I pay $97 per month to hope and wonder if I will get that important business call tomorrow instead of today, or that the call will suddenly be dropped in the middle of important conversations.   I am not singling out this particular location, btw, but the company at large.

Isn't it just typical of Verizon to have sent me this reply to this review last week, only to not reply to me like they said they would. And since customer service is one of major nits with these people, for me, the ball is in their court, which they have failed to return:  "I am very concerned about your experience with our company Chris! I apologize for the inconvenience you had with your upgrade as well as the service! Allow me the opportunity to restore your confidence in Verizon Wireless. You deserve the best customer service and I am here to give that to you! I would like to address your concerns with the dropped calls and provide you information about your upgrade. Please reply back with your full name and mobile number. I will contact you to better assist!"  I gave them my name and number last week, and have not heard back from them. And, I'm not going to go chasing a lame duck. And, now that I read that Verizon donates millions of our dollars to political special interests (which don't have OUR best interests at heart), it just keeps nailing the coffin shut for me. Yes, other big name mobile communications companies use their huge profits for political influence, but almost everything about the way Verizon does business, and fails in its service approach puts them at the bottom of the list behind AT&T , T-Mobile, etc. These companies are dominating our lives because they know, or figure upon the fact that we can't do without our mobile devices. But, what if we all took that power back, and formed a union, and jumped ship en masse? We would bring them to their knees. Who's with me?  And hey, Verizon, how about no more mandatory software "upgrades" that actually slow my phone down and mess it up, with lost settings, that simply pisses me off! And, when will my phone ring when the ringer is turned on? Should I ask for a rebate check for the myriad of lost and deferred calls--some which have cost me a potential client? And, are you going to make good on your promise of a free upgrade to iPhone4S, or was that all golden carrot-dangling mularkey?  Update: 8/19 -The customer service rep who responded below, just like the last person, asked for my info to get right back to me with, and of course, never did. Or, maybe she tried, and the phone never rang, being Verizon. I think I am going to sue Verizon for all my money back + damages. $97 x 20 months = $1,940. Anyone want to start a class action suit with me?

I have to give this establishment a major FAIL tonight. Didn't wanna do it, but their completely amateurish, mindless faux pas tonight behind the bar forced me to do it.  Okay, so...what bartender would toss out an almost-full champagne flute of high-end sparkling sake - wait for it - with a receipt covering the top of it (universal barspeak for "do not touch"!)??? Apparently "Doug" would. So, I return from a quick trip to the restroom and find my receipts, water glass and champagne flute mostly full of my Zipang disposed of by the man who was just seconds earlier being so kind and accommodating.  Well, something's very wrong with this picture, folks. And, did they apologize, when I expressed my dismay, saying "That's why I put the receipt on top of the glass...it was an almost-full flute..."? No. Just a "get him another one" directive from the manager to good ol' Dougie...nothing from the barkeep in question like "Oh, sorry, man. Thought you'd split and left most your drink, covered by your receipt" (Apparently a quite common occurrence in "Doug World")...Nah, just an uncomfortable vibe due to their (his) glaringly poor bartending decision. I sipped my replacement drink and was treated as if I should have cleared out already - or was it the painful embarrassment of a ridiculous bartending mistake hovering over us at that point? I should think the latter. Both are uncomfortable and should be avoided at all costs.  Uh, bottom line (and covered in Bartending Basics 101), Stingray staff: Any object covering a mostly-full drink is probably an indicator from the patron that they are coming back, and wish to consume the rest of said drink.

This is one of my regular shopping destinations for multiple reasons: think spare and progressive; think hip and tasty proprietary products no other stores carry. Think great savings whenever you can pick up one of their $5 off $25 or $10 off $50 coupons.  Their name brand food items are what shine, for me. Their hummus and salsas are hard to beat. They also have great, unique selections on chips, crackers, drinks, cheeses, dinner items (they make a great pizza), nuts and meats. They also have this jalepeno sourdough loaf that I'm just plain addicted to. Their juices are good, but $4.99? Yipes! Pricier than Sunflower. I did notice on my last trip here a couple of days ago that the prices have gone up (!?) And, their produce selection is kind of mediocre. Sprouts, Sunflower, Fry's, and Safeway all beat them.  Another great thing is that they have a discount shelf where you can find all sorts of yummy things for slashed prices. Self-checkout is good...Thanks, F&E!

Uh, when did this place become all Studio 54 on us? Last couple of times I was in here - no big deal, just a good smattering of casual, low-key good-timers hanging out, sipping a few brews, playing ping pong...Fast forward to last night and...oh, how trendy we've become, when the self-important gatekeepers let people in the 50 foot long queue, apparently, whenever they feel the need to (read, 20 min. wait in line while they banter with 16-year old looking ASU barbie dolls and women who feel they need to be well over 6 feet tall, so wear stilleto heels when they are 5'10" plus already...what is this neurosis about being a fucking giraffe, anyhow?) Couldn't get anywhere near the main bar. It was a ridiculous pile of alpha-male moronic mojo. I will say the chick at the "drink tub" was totally chill and the cost of a tall can of PBR and shot of Fireball was only $5. But, bottom line - this is yet another Snottsdale club so full of itself that its patrons walk around in a crowded-out "we're so Hollywood...right?" daze that makes me nauseous and want to pound my drink and go back to Lowkeyland, way out beyond the fake plastic eyes and personalities.

Dropped in spontaneously last Saturday when I was shopping in the Quarter just to see what it was all about. Since it was like 2 PM, the place was pretty dead, but the bartender and hostess were friendly - I had the "health conscious panini" (not sure about the actual name) and I have to say, the quality sucked ass. It tasted like they used wonder bread, and it was wayyyy too cheesy (it had tomato, avocado and goat cheese - the avocado was a teeny tiny slice on each half). When asked by the attentive bartender how the food was, I said "Well...the fries are okay". He didn't inquire further, though he had a great personality.  I like the nouveau Belle Epoch interior. Most likely, though, I won't be back.

I've been in 3 or 4 times now, and I've only sat at the bar for drinks, so mine can't be a complete assessment of all of Citizen's attributes, but from what I've experienced so far, i would give it 4.5 stars if I could. I know they do private 6-course affairs, and reportedly (and believably) have the top mixmaster in the Valley. This place is in my opinion, along with AZ88, the top place to chill upscale in S. Scottsdale with a classy drink and fellow clientele. The service is outstanding as well. When I dropped by last night, a super-friendly fellow met me at the door and apologized, saying they are usually open till 1:30 on Thursdays, but "we'd love to have you back" and handed me their 6-course private dinner menu with a REAL smile. Almost unheard of in douchebaggy Scottsdale. This is a class joint.

Attentive staff, succulent offerings, incredible mixologic concoctions...Citizen continues to inspire with it's near-perfect...okay, PERFECT menu of entrees, cocktails, and starters that plow new ground of satisfaction. I went to AZ88 after this place tonight, and I'm convinced this IS the best place in Lower Scottsdale - -and perhaps the Valley entire, to enjoy...everything!

Wow! I've never been a huge froyo fan...UNTIL NOW. This place truly has it all: it's inviting, has a fantastic selection of tasty, healthy flavors, it's clean, they're friendly and helpful, and the prices are just right, at 39 cents/oz. I will definitely be back, and bring a date, friends, family, etc. I have been to Mojo, Yogurtini, and some others in the Phoenix area, and I have to say Zoyo takes the cake...batter, that is. Thanks, Zoyo!

Met up with friends and did the 6-course beer and food pairing (all for only around $30) last night. I even won the raffle! And yes, I think the maroon Moose Drool golf towel was the appropriate choice in gift - especially when put next to the beer glass with paper placemat and camouflage cap. But anyway, we had a gregarious, rollicking Epicurean evening of beer samplings and not-too-shabby food courses. Loved the bleu cheese crumbles w/  vinagrette salad and the sausage meatball...thing. I like the coffee porter, and the banana-y tasting lager. Ladies, thanks for the extras! Service was top notch - 5 stars for that alone. What a night...I will be back for sure - hopefully with my posse!

Came in here tonight after The W Hotel/Living Room drove me away for a number of reasons. This place is across Buckboard from the W. Had never been in before. It's a hookah lounge/Mediterranean restaurant/pub. Ashley was my server, and she was very nice for taking care of the whole place on a somewhat slow Sunday night. I had the falafel wrap with the fries. Very tasty. Prices are very affordable, by Old Town standards. I will definitely be back!

I stopped in the other day while I was running around and decided to try this relatively new brewery/eatery in my neighborhood I keep driving by...I had a nice hoppy IPA and got the garden burger with it - both extremely enjoyable (I don't know how they got the garden burger patty to resemble an authentic backyard BBQ beef patty!). It was about 2 PM on a Thursday, so it was a totally casual atmosphere, hardly anyone in the joint...bartender friendly, service good...a pretty chill hang, all in all. I think that's what I liked most - the chill factor.

Stopped in here this evening right when they called last call, and Keith the bartender was nice enough to pour me a good red wine and even a complementary shot of flavored whiskey. The ambiance is simply seductive. Shades of Belle Epoch Paris, with chandelier lighting, and a great drink list...I will have to come back with a date and do dinner and the whole works.

Dropped in last night by chance, just walking by. I was thirsty - ordered an unsweetened iced (green) tea. Girl behind the counter was super-friendly and even refilled my already venti-sized cup gratis when I went to leave. Great coffee shop ambiance, location, service, prices...they've got it all going on!

Dined here last night with a friend and received stellar, one-of--a-kind service from another good friend and master sommelier, Darren Lutz, who makes any dining experience unparalleled! Knowing Mr. Lutz' expertise in all things culinary and oenological, I left it up to him to make the food and wine choices for us. Starting with a gorgeous Nebbiolo coupled with a nice olive and onion tapenade and crostini, then on to a beautiful Caesar salad prepared tableside; then, finishing with a very nice Amarone along with the Pappardelle - made of a hearty veal stew, battuto, tomatoes, Porcini mushrooms, white wine, handmade pasta, and Asiago cheese - this was an outstanding gastronomic event. Add to all that sophisticated, cosmopolitan ambiance, attentive, friendly staff (all), and very reasonable prices, Andiamo is a sensuous feast that shouldn't be missed if you want to do Vegas in style!

I finally discovered the best bike shop in the Valley! These guys are fast, courteous, knowledgeable, and best of all - not full of themselves or just plain unfriendly like some of the other bike shops are (especially in Scottsdale). I brought my mountain bike in last month to be fixed, and it promptly was (within 2-3 days). While it was being fixed, I purchased a Trek hybrid for under $500 (to my astonishment). Fast forward to this last weekend, when I brought my tire in to have its tube replaced. They immediately replaced it, and I was in and out of there in about 10-15 mins.   The store itself is small, yet packed with great bikes and gear - at very reasonable prices!
