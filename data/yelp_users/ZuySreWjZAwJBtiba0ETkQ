I think I've found Boba heaven.  One night I was seriously craving Boba and a friend recommended this place.  The girl was really nice, I didn't have to wait longer than a minute, and she didn't have a problem giving me extra Boba.  Did I mention they offer it in a 32 oz. cup?  So many options, this place is great.

I had been to this location once before, liked the concept, and decided to bring a friend to try it out yesterday.  Let's start off with what I liked: The Honeydew seasonal soda was refreshing and not too sweet.   The Shiitake and Tofu Lettuce cups had good flavor and texture, despite being extremely messy.  Now for the rest of our experience: Firstly I should make it clear that I am not picky.  If I am hungry, I will eat anything. We ordered the Sea Bass Fish Tacos and the "TLT"(tempeh bacon BLT) sandwich to split.  The tacos were not good.  The fish was soggy and had almost no texture or flavor.  So much so that myself and my friend, though we arrived very hungry, didn't even attempt to finish them.  The sandwich was ok, and the sweet potato mash that came on the side was completely undercooked, still crunchy.  Overall, a "meh" meal. I'm not one to penny pinch when it comes to a meal.  But to pay $15 for an entree that I didn't even want to finish sucked.  Now on to the service.  I get it, TFK is a busy place.  Being in the service industry myself, I am generally very understanding and patient.  Our server never even refilled our waters, or asked if we might want another soda (I did).  She was also way too touchy-feely.  After we finally received our check, I requested that she take my part out of  two 20s, and put the other half on my friends card.  Ten minutes later, she arrived to tell me that she was very busy and it " wasn't worth it to her to give me change for the second twenty", and that I could just keep the tip.    Now I don't know if she made the assumption that my tip wouldn't be worth her time because of my age, apparel, what have you.  But it felt like a huge slap in the face, considering that I was going to tip her my normal 40% despite getting shoddy service and not enjoying my meal.  I've never been treated like that, and I would never treat someone that way.   It's been made very clear to me by that server that True Foods Kitchen doesn't need my business.  So guys, you got your wish.  I won't ever be back and I'll make sure to let my friends know why.

I love La Condesa!  I've been here a million times and never been disappointed.   The veggie tacos have so much flavor,  some of the best I've ever had.  The Puebla Quesa is amazing with the cashew salsa from their crazy huge salsa bar.  Their homemade jamaica and horchata are great.  Honestly there's not a bad thing I can say about this place.

The BEST veggie burger I've ever had in the last 15 years of being vegetarian!   Ooh and the french fries come with this seasoning not unlike bbq potato chips, which ruled.  Staff was very friendly, love the neighborhood and the building.

Service was so slow!  We felt like we were on an island.  Three different servers for a 6 person table.  We visited on a Thursday night and it wasn't very busy.   Then at the end we had to tell the server what we got so she could ring it up.  Good thing we're honest....  Won't be back.
