We were craving good Mexican and luckily stumbled on to this place.  All we got were the breakfast burritos, but they were amazing!  I can't wait to go back and try everything thing else on the menu cause everything looked great!  The owner was really nice, service was amazing, he even gave us a free lemonade cause we had a little bit of a wait.  I would highly recommend this place!

We eat here almost once a month with my wife's family.  The service is impeccable, If you ever get Jill she is the best!  The food never disappoints.  The ravioli is always a favorite.  If they are serving osso buco you have to get it!  My favorite is the clams linguini in the white wine sauce.  Love this place!

Great sandwiches, amazing cannoli but the lady at the front where you get your cookies and pay isn't very friendly. Almost seems like she hates being there, oh well.

This place needs some yelp love! I think they get jipped cause none of these old folks in Sun City use smart phones. Definitely a top Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Great food, good salsa and cheap.

The food was decent other than the brown/rotting avocados they served and said "that's how they always are".  I grew up in so cal with two huge avocado trees that produce 2000+ avocados a year and avocados aren't supposed to be brown.  It's also very cramped inside, almost no seating available, I think it maybe had seating for like 20 or so people at the most.

This place is sooooo good! I've been here twice now, the first time I got the torta norteña de pollo and this last time I got the norteña con carne asada.  I like the chicken a little better.  The chocolate flan is pretty darn good as well.  Great authentic mexican food!!

By far the best mexican food I've found in Phoenix, and trust me, I've eaten at almost all of them :)  I tend to get their street tacos with either pastor or carne asada, but everything is good here.  They have an awesome little salsa bar with like 10 different kinds of salsa.  I live in Anthem and we drive out of our way 30+ minutes to eat here it's that good!

Some of the best ground beef I've ever had.  I will definitely return.

Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars?? We ordered the house salad which was mediocre at best, boring and bland, the ranch wasn't very good either. It came with 3 garlic knots that practically had no flavor at all, weird. We also had 2 cheese slices, 1 Hawaiian and 1 pepperoni, the pizza was ok but definitely not 4.5 stars. I give this place 2.5 stars on a good day. Times Square Pizzeria on Deer Valley is a thousand times better than this place.

Review update!  Caution!  Caution!! This place has new owners and I guess they don't like good food and service cause they got rid of everything that was great about this place before.  It took FOREVER to get our food, the salsa was horrible, it tasted like burnt gasoline, the food pretty much sucked, and the dining area was hot and stuffy.   DO NOT EAT HERE, SAVE YIUR MONEY. I would seriously rather eat Mcdonalds than eat here again.

Worst Mexican food I've had in awhile.  Who puts nacho cheese in a carnitas burrito?  No good Mexican restaurant will use nacho cheese on anything!  The empanadas were cold, they tasted like they were frozen.

Organic, locally grown, no chemicals or hormones!! This place is really good!  My wife got the French Toast and More and I got the Biscuits an Gravy. You can tell everything is made fresh with high quality ingredients and food.  Definitely one of the best places to eat in Anthem AZ!    This place is on a completely different level then almost all the other restaurants in Anthem.  The owner seemed really nice and the service was great. If you have good taste and like "Real" food you definitely need to eat here.

They have the best chocolate malt I've ever had.  Wasn't impressed with the italian sausage or the tamale bowl.  But, the malt was amazing!

Best Sushi I've had in AZ!  It actually reminded me of the quality of sushi I'm used to from Hawaii.  High quality, fresh, thick cuts of sushi.  Get the sweet shrimp, I always love the fried shrimp heads.

Finally! Hands down, the best mexican food I've had in a long long time.  We had the Ribeye tacos and some homemade flan.  Everything on the menu looked great.

The salsa here is the best I've had in Phoenix. You can ask them to make it as spicy as you like.  They make the chips and salsa fresh when you sit.
