I had a gift certificate for a free meal for two here and finally got around to using it right before it expired, and I'm sure glad I did! I didn't have very high expectations to be honest. And when we walked in we were the only ones there except for an elderly business man on his laptop...not a good sign I thought (even for a downtown restaurant in a downtown that clears out after business hours during the week).   Anyway, everything we had to eat was delicious. We got the chicken tenders for an appetizer and it was very good quality meat, and not too greasy. The girlfriend got the chili, which was really good in no small part due to the fact that the meat used is brisket. Genius. I had the steak and rib combo. Steak was cooked to order and tasty. But the ribs are where it's at. Tender baby back ribs with thick, sweet bbq sauce. The meal also came with 2 rolls, mashed potatoes, and steamed veggies. You're not going home hungry that's for sure.  And the service was excellent. Granted, we were the only ones there. But still, our waiter went above and beyond and was so nice. I was worried he would mail it in when I showed our gift certificate but not at all.

My favorite lunch place downtown! Stick to any of the pastrami or corn beef sandwiches. My personal favorite is the New Yorker. Pastrami (or corned beef if you prefer) with cole slaw and russian dressing..mmm. Their other sandwiches are pretty good too (I've gotten a turkey sandwich that was good and the deli chix sandwich was ok).   Now, you have to be on your toes when ordering as they move pretty fast, which is understandable considering the big lunch line. Fries are the default and you have to speak up if you want something else. Mac and cheese is good. Salad and fruit are good options if you're trying to mitigate the damage done to your diet from the sandwich.    I also like all the historical photos of downtown Phoenix and the owners' story. Mix of all different business types, lawyers, etc.. Makes downtown Phoenix feel like a real downtown.

Pros: cool atmosphere, good service, good location, quality ingredients  Cons: limited menu (3 salads, only 4 sandwiches at a place called bread), very frufru  More pros than cons on the list, but I didn't like my chicken salad sandwich even though the ingredients were of good quality. There wasn't much chicken but a lot of arugula and apples. I'm okay with some diced apple as a garnishment but there were so many that it overpowered the sandwich and made it too sweet. Not the savory taste I'm looking for with a chicken salad sandwich. Cool atmposhere, but not cool enough to go to and not be satisfied with the food.

My favorite pizza in town! I love the thin crust. Sweet sauce, thin crunchy crust, gooey cheese. Great combination of flavors. Man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I tried the spaghetti calzone: so many carbs, so delicious. And for good measure, they make some really good chocolate chip cookies.

I've been here several times and have never been disappointed with my coffees and lattes. All expertly made with quality beans, and not super caffeinated with a side of jitters like you get at Starbucks. Nice enough patio, but something about the layout of the inside is not feng shui, could be a little cozier. I wish that they had a drive through, because then I'd be there all the time!

First the cons: Yes, the decor is dated. With full on Italian music playing. And it was a little pricey for a neighborhood Italian place.  But it gets 4 stars because the food was really good and the service. Everyone there was very friendly and warm, and they really seemed to care that you enjoy your meal.

I've been coming here since high school and this is THE spot in Phoenix for Chicken & Waffles. You have to go to the one downtown. I went to the Scottsdale location and it just wasn't the same. The original downtown location is in this old house, which is very cozy and inviting whereas the Scottsdale location is a huge space in a strip mall (though I heard they're moving locations?) where they are pumping out meals so I don't think the food is quite as good (it does comes out faster).  The fried chicken is crispy and delicious and the waffles are large thin but still have that crunch. The sides are also pretty good, especially the mac n cheese, but I usually don't have room for much more than the chicken and waffles. I go with the Lo-Lo's- 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. Great sugary drinks in mason jars--sweet tea, lemonade, kool aid. Mmmm haven't been to Lo-Los in a while, just writing this makes me want to go back.

This is one of the classic burger joints in Phoenix. Just walk up to the grill and place your order. The Big One is the standard but get the The Great Big One if you're really hungry. Slide on over to the left and grab a drink. Then just be patient and they'll have your burger ready in a minute. Slide over to the left again and you can grab a fry. Then time to pay--cash only, mind you. Now the beauty of the process is the condiments bar. You can make as simple or complex of a burger as you want. Nothin fancy, just a burger done exceptionally well.  I miss the second location they had in Scottsdale on Scottsdale and Shea. An Oreganos replaced it years ago and I still hold an irrational grudge against that establishment.

Great place to catch a game. Stay cool in the summer when the roof is closed and the A/C is on. Also, some of the most reasonable concession prices in baseball--it's a fact, google it.

Solid Chinese place good for either takeout or nice dine-in experience. The staff were all very nice and they seemed to know and take care of their return customers. The food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced. We had kung pao chicken and hot and sour soup. It's a great neighborhood spot and I will definitely return.

This is my favorite place for my morning latte.  It has a hip interior to hang out and some patio seating as well.  But usually, I go through the drive thru.  Yup, this independent coffee shop has a drive thru. The staff are always friendly as they walk up to your car and take your order.  When I "forget" to eat breakfast at home, I order a breakfast sandwich here-  your choice of bagel, ham, egg and cheese.  They also have an assortment of baked goods.  The coffee is way better than any chain, especially ones with weird mermaid logos, and in my top tier of independent coffee spots in Phoenix as well.

Dick's really is hidden away. I had been to Luci's next door several times and hadn't noticed it. DH has a bar right as you walk in and a small dining area in a separate room to the right. The menu is very similar to its sister restaurants, the Rokerij and Richardson's. Great happy hour with a solid margarita and really tasty appetizers; I like the carne adovada sliders, chipotle ribs, and the quesadilla. DH, like its sister restaurants, is on the pricier side but very well worth it.

This location gets 1 extra star because the staff were pleasant enough. It gets low marks for two reasons. First, it doesn't accept einstein gift cards. Look, I understand you're a franchise location but you're still an Einstein's. As a customer I shouldn't have to figure out which Einstein's to go to if I have gift cards. If you hold yourself out as an Einstein's to get the benefits of that brand, you should take the burdens too, including taking gift cards. This is something headquarters and franchises need to work out rather than putting the onus on customers.  Corporate rant over.  Second, they forgot to toast my bagel. Still a decent bagel but I was really craving the toastiness. All I ordered was a bagel and a coffee. I'd be more forgiving if it was busy but I was the only person there. The employees outnumbered me 3 to 1. I had a small, simple order. Not as much leeway for mistakes in my book.

First, the couple good parts: the docs have always been nice and fairly competent. unfortunately, i've had a different one every single time i've been there so I don't have any loyalty to them. the technicians have been fine as well.  But the rest of the staff...yikes! They are incompetent and downright rude (they were talking crap about me, other customers, other employees in earshot of everyone). I tried explaining that the doctor told me I could go home, call them and tell them the brand, features, etc I was already wearing, and then they would finalize my prescription. The "lady" I was passed off to then 1) pressured me to buy contacts from them rather than online and 2) when I refused, proceeded to make it as difficult as possible for me to get contacts from anywhere else. Despite what the doc said, she said that I had to come back for a trial pair because they didn't have any in stock (great!) then I'd have to come back a third time for a follow up. Ridiculous.   They didn't get the trials in for over a week. I finally made it back in two weeks after that. After more arguing, I convinced them to let me have a follow up right there and then because I was already wearing the contacts I wanted and this time I brought the actual box and contact case with all the information, so I didn't need the trial pair. Doc approved, I grabbed my contacts lens Rx and bounced.  I also needed new glasses but I wasn't giving Nationwide any more business so I went to a Lenscrafters. At Lenscrafters, they needed my eyeglass Rx (Nationwide had only given me a copy of the contact Rx) so they called Nationwide. Nationwide refused to turn over the prescription unless I faxed a release, which of course took them a half hour. The lady at Lenscrafters was stunned. She had never had to do that and didn't even have a release form because most places will just fax the prescription over no problem.   By the way, you're not a nationwide chain so your name is stupid. Never again, never again.

This is one of my favorite restaurants!  Everything on the menu is great.  My favorites include the baguette and baked goat cheese to start, the french onion burger, and pork chile verde.    The ambiance is second to none.  Modern landscaping invites you in.  There's an inside/outside bar with seats on the inside on one side and on the other side on the outside patio.  The patio wraps around and provides an intimate, relaxed dining experience.  The inside is more vibrant, with loud music playing (but not so loud that you can't have a conversation).  I also hear they have a great Sunday brunch with a jazz trio for entertainment.  It's a great spot if you're in Central Phoenix.

Recently moved to the Slope and glad that Los Reyes reigns supreme here. The tortas (Mexican sandwiches) are huge, they are delicious, and they will, they will, rock you. But what else would you expect from Los Reyes de la Torta? What you might not know is that their non-torta items are at least as good. Whatever the cheese they use (a white cheese, cotija maybe?) is delicious, not like the cheese used typically at the more Americanized places (which are also good, not trying to knock those). And the aguas frescas are very tasty as well; it's like drinking fruit! This place lives up to the hype so go check it out, but be prepared to wait because it's usually busy even during the week.

My dad's (the "Mayor of Scottsdale") favorite place! haha We always have celebrations here so I think it's good for groups. The service is top notch and the food is even better. I always made fun of my dad that this is the only place he'll go for a steak, but I've come to believe that City Hall does indeed have the best steaks in town.

I've had a lot of good food here: breakfast burritos, sandwiches, salads, pasta. Never had a bad meal and everything is reasonably priced, especially for downtown. I recommend a half sandwich with side (pasta or salad). The half sandwich is really the size of a whole, plus you get variety with the pasta or salad. Best of both worlds.

Indian Paradise has a solid lunch buffet. At $11.95 maybe a little more expensive than usual for a buffet but it's in North Scottsdale so not completely unexpected either. Nice interior and even looks like the patio could be a pleasant dining experience when there's nice weather, surprising considering that the restaurant is located in a fairly bland, out of the way strip mall.  The food was very tasty and will certainly sate your desire for Indian. Comparatively, it was middle of the road as far as the Indian food I've had--not the best but not the worst. But if you love Indian food like I do, you won't be disappointed. The lunch buffet has a lot of the standard dishes: chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, aloo matter, palak paneer, tandoori chicken, etc. Tikka masala is usually my favorite but theirs was just ok. I really liked their chicken curry and aloo matar.  Service was good; everyone was friendly and attentive.  Also, don't panic when you don't see the naan at the buffet like I did. They bring you your own basket. :)

Yes, not your traditional Indian food because they don't use butter, fry things, etc. For some things that makes a big difference. The samosas for instance aren't nearly as good as real fried samosas. Frying makes everything better (and less healthy obviously). But other dishes were very close approximations and much healthier. Was the tikka masala as good as if it was loaded with butter? No, of course not. But I thought it was still quite tasty and was happy knowing that I could enjoy a healthy version of one of my favorite Indian dishes.   The service was pretty good, no complaints there. Looked like they had a huge wine selection for such a small restaurant.  If you want traditional Indian that's fine, just go to a traditional Indian restaurant. So come to Bombay Spice knowing what you're in for and you'll be satisfied.

The food is pretty good, definitely above the average and has some different choices. I've had the eggs benedict and costa breakfast burrito (chorizo) and both hit the spot. Very fresh and tasty and the coffee is quite good.   But what really sets this place apart is the dining experience. I really enjoy the fast casual set up--order, take a number, get your coffee, juice, etc., and wait for your food. There are plenty of tables and the system runs smoothly and efficiently. This process makes me want to go here more than other breakfast places, even ones that may have slightly better food. At the end of the day I don't want to wait an hour no matter how good your frittata is.

Kinda pricey, apparently because it's organic and gluten free because it's not for taste or portion size. Service was just ok. I don't know, I know people that like it so maybe I'll give it another try. But I know of plenty of really good pizza places so I don't know when.

A great place to either grab a beer and/or enjoy some comfort food. The set up is a little awkward; when you walk in the dining area and kids play area(?) with video games is on the left and the bar and patio are to the right so choose accordingly. It has a long bar with big tvs and all the standard beers. The burgers are really good--"juicey lucy" style with cheese on the inside of the burger-- and they serve tater tots as sides.

What a hidden gem! I just moved back to Scottsdale after several years away for college and grad school and have been excited to explore new places. I saw the reviews for the Cider Mill and was not disappointed.  Went there on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't very crowded, only a few other parties there. It's a cozy little place, very homey. Very friendly and helpful service, but not overbearing.  I had a hard cider that was really good--not too sweet, just right--and my friend had a homemade root beer that looked really good too. Per the suggestion of other Yelpers, I tried the reuben for my first time and man did that hit the spot. I don't even like Reubens that much (got light sauerkraut) but this one was awesome. Great rye bread and corned beef. The thousand island dressing was a bit sweet for my tastes but still good overall. My friend got the Nay's Milly Philly which also looked tasty.   Can't wait to come back for lunch sometime and try some more homemade sodas and sandwiches!

The coolest part of this place has to be the wall of the sodas. Bottled sodas that you've never heard of; I want to go back just to try more. I got two to take home: a Moxie for myself and this Japanese soda for my wife. The former was very old fashioned (I should have known by the Ted Williams poster they have displayed by the case) and not very good, at least to my taste. My wife's soda was a strawberry-flavored beverage with a really interesting bottle design and mechanism to open. It looked like a baby bottle and you use part of the top to open it...hard to explain.  As for the food, I had a chili cheese burger that was quite tasty. The burgers are served on large, soft buns perfect for their hefty burger creations. The chili was pretty sold, a firm B+ (nowhere can come close to the best chili cheeseburger in the world, which fyi, is at Tommy Burger in Los Angeles). The fries were just so so, not quite crispy enough.  I'll definitely be back and I'll come with an even bigger appetite, probably for the Philly Burger :)

Jambalya= Cajun stew, usually good but not very accessible or common (at least not in AZ) Burrito= kinda good, some people love them, I think they're usually too big and unwieldy...just give me some tacos or an enchilda  Jamburrito=....Out.of.this.World!   Tried it at Food Truck Fridays and man was it worth the wait and $. It was $9 for a chicken Jamburrito, hushpuppies and a soda. Not bad, and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I only finished half and am still full 3 hours later. At the same time, it wasn't as overwhelming to me as a Chipotle burrito. Maybe because they cut it in half so I can easily save the other half for later.  Anyway, this is one of those fusions that just works. It's a great tortilla and good jambalya, and together they combine for a really tasty and unique meal.

Churn is designed as a classic ice cream shop (and has the accompanying candy to prove it) but also features some different flavors and interesting sundaes. I've gotten the S'mores sundae before, and though pretty good, was a little too much for me. I'd stick to a regular sundae. Usually I get the ice cream cookie sandwich. Pick two freshly baked cookies and an ice cream that they scoop right in there.   Once you get your treat, head to the back patio, which adjoins the back patio for Windsor, the restaurant next door. They're open late and they're always peppy, so be prepared to reciprocate with at least a smile.

Healthy, tasty and quick. The Trifecta. Hard to find. I didn't even really know what kind of food it was before I went. I guess it's contemporary Mediterranean?  I got the chicken kabobs per the recommendation of the friendly cashier. Chicken was very good, nicely spiced. Comes with rice pilaf and greek salad, both were done well. Overall a healthy, tasty meal and a great alternative to fast food.

I bought in on the whole gourmet food truck trend and had been to Food Truck Fridays a few times, but I gotta be honest that I was skeptical of pizza from a truck. I'm also not afraid to admit when I'm wrong, and I was very wrong in this case. The pizza wasn't just good for a truck. It was just damn good. Great thin crispy crust and lots of different, fresh toppings. Will definitely be back

My biggest gripe is the value and variety. The two v's, very important. The sandwiches are 7/8 dollars but don't come with anything. And all they have are salad and chips. Also, the sandwiches aren't that big. Tasty enough, but nothing all that special. I also had breakfast here one time, and, again, not bad but nothing special. So, I wouldn't be against going here if someone suggests it, but not my choice.  Maybe I'll try the coffee bar and pastries.

It's more like a 3.5.  Pros: good chicken tikka masala, pretty good naan, yummy samosas, spicy but not too spicy, very reasonably priced and good for takeout, friendly service  Cons: The dal curry had a strange consistency. Echoing some of the earlier comments the restaurant isn't that clean. Also not a germaphobe and have lower expectations for hole-in-the-wall/mom and pop shops, but still seemed like it wasn't clean enough.

I was excited to come here after seeing the good reviews but was disappointed. I got the patty melt and it was nothing special. I felt I could have made something reasonably equivalent at home. Maybe I should have gotten a burger with a bun but still, on a patty melt i would expect thicker slices of sandwich bread than what they serve. Fries were slightly undercooked and didn't taste really fresh.

Solid neighborhood restaurant in a great location--right on the bridle path on central and off the canal. They have a nice patio wedged right in between the bridle path and canal. Ride your bike here for happy hour all day! I like that they have small pitchers of beer; its just the right amount for two people (if you just want a beer each) or one person (if you want a couple beers for yourself) There are small tvs on the walls behind the booths; not the greatest to watch a game but ok if don't care about the game and are more focused on food.   Just about everything I've had here has been good. The pretzel and sausage plate is a really good app. The crispy chicken sandwich and chicken and biscuits are my favorite. The burger was, surprisingly, just okay.

It's hard for me to give a breakfast place more than 4 stars, because breakfast is breakfast right? Well, Snooze earns the 5th star because it didn't miss on anything. The wait was an hour long on Sunday morning, but it's a popular place so can't ding them for that. The coffee was really good--you can read the long story about how it's from their partner farm in Guatemala or you can just drink and enjoy. Our group got a variety of breakfast items--French Toast, Corned Beef Hash, traditional Eggs Benedict, Chilaquiles Benedict, Scrambled Eggs. Our kind server also brought us out a complimentary speciality pancake, which was tasty. Everything was on point. The table was silent; everyone was enjoying their meal. I had the traditional eggs benedict (Ham Benedict III). The ham was shaved, which I surprisingly liked. The hollandaise was also light and not overpowering and not too thick. It's a long wait, but worth it.

I really wanted to like this place because I have a soft spot for diners and dives (not so much drive ins). And this place has the traditional diner set up on the inside located in an area of town (the Melrose) that I'm really rooting for to turn into something truly special (it's already pretty cool). But, I just didn't like the food. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which was eggs, sausage and cheese on a croissant. The croissant was ehhh ok. The eggs/sausage/cheese was greasy and not very flavorful. It came with a side of potatoes which were also pretty m'eh. I'll give this one another shot at some point.

What a cool concept and perfect complement to the 16th street/bethany area. A tiny bar with interesting decor, lots of really great beer and wine, reasonable prices, and a friendly and enthusiastic bartender/owner.   The place was packed when we arrived on a Saturday night but managed to find a table by the door. Eventually some other people left so we were able to snag a couple more seats for our friends. The WP manages to balance the small quarters so that even when it's full it felt cozy, not cramped or uncomfortable. It felt like you were in somebody's really cool private home bar and Greg (the owner) and other patrons made it a very welcoming atmosphere. We had a couple drinks and were able to talk amongst ourselves when we wanted and chat with the other patrons at other points. All that to say that the WP has a natural, comfortable feel.  The chalkboard displays a huge variety of beer and wine. Don't be intimidated. Just pick a random one if you're adventurous. Or ask Greg, he's happy to make suggestions. Also, the snacks and desserts are really good. Our friends had a brownie and I had a bite, very tasty. And then we got a couple ham and cheese sandwiches with this really great ham from Schreiner's. You probably wouldn't want to go here for dinner because it's really just finger foods (and there are lots of good restaurants nearby), but it's all so good it wouldn't be the worst thing if you pigged out (see what I did there?!) on some ham&cheese sandwiches, cheese plates and baked goods.   In sum, it's a great little place to come have a drink with friends. And you can easily stay here and enjoy all night, but at the same time you have lots of great restaurant and bar options within easy walking distance. Look forward to coming back!

I came here for the first time during Restaurant Week and this was the best meal I've had in a while. My wife and I sat at the bar overlooking the open kitchen. I had the roasted corn dumplings and kung pao fried chicken. I didn't take a photo but I should have because the presentation was very appealing, and they tasted even better.   The dumplings were a small pond of a tomato ginger broth which had the perfect amount of spice. The kung pao chicken was the same idea as you'd find in an American Chinese restaurant except everything was fresh and cooked perfectly, not greasy at all. My wife had the caesar salad and mongolian beef. The salad was a fairly typical caesar but with szechuan croutons and a poached egg on top. The mongolian beef was, like the chicken, the same idea as  what is offered at American Chinese restaurants but more sophisticated and executed to perfection (the roasted cashews were a nice touch).   And then they went ahead and nailed dessert. The fritters were fried and they were delicious. And the tea-a-misiu was a great tiramisu but with a hint of tea, I think I liked it even better than regular tiramisu.   Well done, Koi, we will be back.

I'm very glad my wife and I finally got around to trying El Chullo, a little hole in the wall off 7th street.  I got the escabeche de pollo.  The chicken is described as pan fried but it didn't taste fried, and I mean that in a good way, and the sauce was very tasty.  My wife loved the tallarines verdes-- pesto spaghettis (yes, spaghetti with an s) and steak.  And for dessert: a giant alfajor, cookies with dulce de leche filling. Overall, a great first Peruvian food experience

Where to begin. Walking in is almost overwhelming (in a good way)- very cool! Anime playing on the wall behind bar running the length of the restaurant, a huge mural painting on the back wall, buddha statue at the entrance. Who knew such a hip restaurant could be in our neighborhood in this little strip mall?!  The food lived up to how awesome the restaurant looks. We had the egg rolls, spring rolls, chicken lollipops and the pad thai. Everything was on point. The egg rolls are mini which makes them very crisp and tasty. The shrimp spring rolls were very fresh and the pad thai was done very well without being greasy at all. My favorite, though, were the chicken lollipops. They are what I would call sophisticated chicken wings. Sweet but not too sweet, some spice, really good quality chicken, and just a little messy.  We will be back and I hope everyone in the neighborhood supports this place because it's a true gem.

There are some great Mexican restaurants in Sunnyslope but Paquime serves a good niche.  It's a great take out place but also a great place to dine in, with very modern and clean interior. It also serves up some high quality Mexican food: tortas, tacos, oh and the super nachos! Just too much good stuff to name in one review.  You really can't go wrong.  To finish it off, try one of the paletas or pan dulce for dessert.

What a nice addition to the neighborhood, located right next to the French Grocery, Mucho Macho is the product of one of the founders of the now-defunct Tacos Atoyac. I stopped in for some takeout and got a carne asada burrito, the chicken quesadilla, chips and salsa, and an horchata. Everything was very fresh and tasty, and at a reasonable price (around $20 total). Will definitely be coming back here, especially for take out.

If you are looking for a fun bar in North Central, Linger Longer is your place.  It's basically like the Vig (same owners) but with more inside games (darts, skiball, shuffle board) rather than a giant patio.  The game room is separate from the bar--you just walk across a small courtyard to get there.  The bar itself has plenty of tables as well as a small dance floor with a DJ.  I see Linger Longer as North Central's answer to Arcadia's Little Woody (again, same owners).  It's a nice hidden gem of a bar and a good alternative to the Yard if you're looking for a smaller, more chill spot but still want to play some games with your drinking.

I was really excited for Shake Shack to open its Phoenix location, literally just a few minutes' walk from my house.  I had it when I lived in Washington, D.C. about 4 years ago and have been craving it ever since.  Honestly, this led to unfair expectations, but the food was still really good.  The burger practically melts in your mouth because of the buttery bun and good quality cheese.  I have to say that the patty itself isn't anything special.  I like the crinkle cut fries and (can't believe I'm actually saying this) but they are a little too crispy for my taste.  This may be because it's a new location and the employees haven't nailed the art of fry-making.  Also, it's awesome that they have beer and wine, including some local selections.    My biggest gripe is that it is pricey.  People compare Shake Shack and In N Out, which is a hard comparison because they're just different.  But In N Out is clearly the better bang for your buck.  Nonetheless, I will still find myself at Shake Shack happily eating a Shack Burger and crinkle cut fries.
