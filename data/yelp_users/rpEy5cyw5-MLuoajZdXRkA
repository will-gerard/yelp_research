This is sub par to the other frozen custard places that have pooped up like weeds as of late. The place smelled and was dirty. The food was over priced and tasted bland. The concrete was okay, nothing special. This is place will close down before to long.

Great little place. The hamburgers are Juicy, the fries are crisp. the shakes are made with real ice cream and are huge portions. The staff is super friendly and easy to talk to. The make the food right there behind the counter where you can see. Sadly i have not tried anything but the Hamburgers here cause they are so good. I am surprised this place has not moved to a bigger location. I deserves was more attention then it gets.

Stopped in here today and figured I would give it a try as I pass it all the time. First thing is the smoking section is right in front of the place so you have to walk through it to get inside. I get splitting migraines from cigarette smoke so I had to hold my breath. once in side there was a sign saying please seat your self.  so we did and figured they did not see us come in because it took for ever to get service. the booth was dirty, and the window sill had a inch layer of dust, with some old fries and about five dead flies on it. it took forever for the food to come, which is odd because there was only five people in the place and three outside smoking. the food was nothing to brag about just plain bleh. Not sure how they stay in business must have cheap drink on the lounge side and if you are wasted you don't care about the rest. place should shut down.

Took my mom, for a nice Sunday morning meal. The place was dirty, and the wait staff was not very attentive to our needs. There was a group of people in booth behind my mom, and the way they where speaking was just sad. F bombs every other word, and one of the woman in the girl was going  into detail about her sexual experiences. If this is the type of clientele they want to attract because the waitress was right there talking with them while ignoring us. Then they can keep them and we will find a better place. The only saving grace so to speak was the food was decent, but not good enough to over come all the negatives.

By far for me, this is the best Pizza around. I love the sweet sauce, for some it might be to much but for me it is perfect. I would recommend sticking with the thin crust as the tradition is a little to much dough. I have had salads, spaghetti and meatballs, pretty much everything on the menu and not once was anything bad. the only complaint I have is there is not one by me.

Went here a Buddy on mine. It was our first time going so did not know what to expect. We were greeted by Tony who introduced himself shook out hand and was just a great guy. Since it was our first time there Tony gave us an order of Garlic Knots free of charge. They where great Nice and doughy the way I like em. We ended up ordering the Deluxe pizza, it came out pipping hot and looking great. Had to wait a little for it to cool off, but it tasted great. The staff there are nice and helpful, Food was delicious. Now for the cons, We had to wait approximately 30 min for food. They where busy and did order a large pizza, but was still a long wait. They also do not have pizza smaller then 14" unless you want just a single slice. For the wait I would suggest just call ahead and let them know what time you will be arriving if dinning in, as for the one just be prepared for left overs.

Moe, Josh, Kevin, and the whole gang over at tires2go are the best you will find. I have been sending people to them for years. I have been unemployed for over a year and they took my situation in to account and was very helpful in getting me the best Tires in my budget. Can not say enough about them, stop in and talk to them and you will see for your self how great they are.

Got the Amazon Local deal and took my friend, as we always see this place and have talked about trying it...First thing I noticed was the hours on the door written in dry erase open till when ever no other information, that is not way to list your hours... The place was clean but the manager was behind the counter in a tank top, sorry for me if you are serving me food at least put on a proper shirt (very minor compliant)...we had the three meat trio( brisket, pulled pork, and Hot links) and two sides (coleslaw, and beans) The meat had no flavor what so ever, we had to drown it in BBQ sauce to get any flavor, the sauce was good. Hot links tasted link frozen grocery story brand. The coleslaw was just horrid no other to describe it, the beans where bland, the Soda where flat and the lemonade ran out and was never refilled. If they want to survive in this area which is known for being a business killer, they need to change and change fast...I am willing to give them another shot but only if I hear they have changed this place is ran...

My friend and I went here Saturday night as he had some coupons. He went there before and figured I would enjoy it. He was right, this place has great food, Great customer service, and was clean. The only complaint I have is I ordered the Po boy Oyster and it was in the 2 item side order area but only came with on side. I asked the lady behind the counter and she said that she was sorry but it was printed in the wrong area of the menu. I will be going back again to try out other items.

After hearing about this place when it opened up in Scottsdale. I was happy to hear one had opened up in Tempe. When we first got there the parking lot was packed, which usually happens when something new opens up. People love to be trendy and hip, why going to a new fast food place is that I don't know. I ordered the bacon burger, fries, and a chocolate malt My friend had the Italian beef (claims to be Chicago #1). Had to wait in a huddled group of people all carefully listening for the number to be called. you could hear after every time the girl said a number everyone asking what did she say? The Burger tasted fine, just like you would get any where else. For $10 meal I felt ripped off. When I took the top bun off and looked at it. the first thing that came to my mind was an old lady saying wheres the beef! The patty was so small. The fries where okay, the malt tasted like powder. My friends meal was bland and tasteless, he had to pull the peppers out and throw them away as they where tough and chewy. If this is the number one restaurant in Chicago then I know the reason the all move here now, to get away from this crap.  If you want a good fast Chicago restaurant go to Luke's on Indian school in Phoenix, you won't be disappointed.
