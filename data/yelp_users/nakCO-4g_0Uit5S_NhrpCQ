People are absolutely rude and disrespectful to complain about children at a library or people having conversations. If you want quiet, go home or put headphones in.   This PUBLIC library was wonderful when I visited last week. It was small and the staff was super helpful. Not to mention the location is great. I'm glad people that don't like children prefer other locations, that just means the great book selection here and overly friendly staff that answered all my questions and engaged me will be able to help those that appreciate this public service.  Two thumbs way up. I'll be back.

Tried to call several minutes ago to find out if they have a book in stock and ask the price. Phone recording says they are open right now (Tuesday, 9am open time, which was over an hour ago). I guess they don't need my business.  Mesa community college has really tried to up their bookstore experience since remodeling, I guess I'll give them my money from now on even if it's a bit more for my textbooks....

I was so frustrated after leaving this place yesterday, and today the more I think about my experience with Desert Title Service, I realized I had to write a review.  The DMV is not fun. 3rd party DMV companies aren't fun either... We all understand this. However, because we all have precious little time in our day, many of us opt to pay EXTRA for the convenience of companies like this one. Mind you, I said we PAY MORE.  I've been dealing with the frustration of trying to transfer the title of my vehicle I just paid off to the person who purchased my car. I understood before coming to this location that I am waiting for the system to show the dealership and bank had transferred the title to me. I brought all my necessary paperwork with me and I was more than kind, patient, and polite.  The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because there was no waiting time for me, and a woman behind a desk assisted me right away. This is the only reason I didn't give Desert Title 1 Star.  From the moment that I explained to the woman that I wanted to check to see if the title was in my name yet, she was frustrated and told me it's likely that it's not in my name yet, and "Oh well, we can check anyways". I asked questions because I was given different time frames by another 3rd party DMV company on how long this process takes in the Arizona Department of Transportation system. She got rude with me from this point out.  If I remember correctly, she all but insulted me because I didn't know how HER system worked, she rolled her eyes because of my concerns about the car still being registered to me, and she basically gave me wrong information about the servicearizona.com website also. I literally walked out of this place mid sentence because she also decided to tell me if I was concerned about selling my vehicle to someone I didn't know, it would be my fault if something happened to the vehicle.   I will never go back here. I was at another 3rd party company a few days ago in the middle of phoenix off of 19th Ave and Camelback and got better service. I'll drive elsewhere from now on, which is a shame because of how close this place is to my home. Don't let the pretty office design fool you. The women there working would rather talk about the "delicious salads" they all ate for lunch rather than help you with your DMV needs.     ****EDIT: I decided to actually change this from 2 stars to 1 star. I called back to the first 3rd party company that tried to help me 3 days ago, Gonzalez Motor Vehicle Service off of 19th ave and Indian School Road. The Ladies there REMEMBERED me, were so NICE and sweet, she actually offered to check my license plate over the phone again, and guess what? It was completed. So not only was the lady at Desert Title RUDE and INSULTING, but she was wrong to refer me to the servicearizona website (they wanted to charge me $3 just to check every time) and also the lady at Desert Title said this process would take usually up to 2 weeks. It wasn't even 3 full days and I will now drive ALL THE WAY across town instead to get better customer service. Whatever, It will be desert title's loss....   I do seriously hope they hire better employees in the future.

Sunday morning, the boyfriend and I wanted to get breakfast at our favorite spot, Chompies. I knew it was Late Sunday morning, so we didn't mind a bit of a wait after riding our bikes down and asking for a table inside. Hosts were great as always, quick to seat us. They have people that make sure you get ice water right away...  Here is where I started to have a problem. Two waiters zipped around the tables behind us, in front of us, next to us. A table sat AFTER us got coffee, orders placed, etc. We waited patiently, still, not even drink orders. (Let me also say, I'm a waitress and I know servers can get busy) So we thought they didn't realize who's section we were in, the guy or the girl. We waited some more. I watched and flagged someone down, letting her know we hadn't been helped yet and just wanted some coffee. She said she'd let our waitress know. 5 minutes, she gets our food order, I asked for a cup of coffee. 5 minutes later, still no coffee. I got up and went to the front, nicely asked if we could sit somewhere else because our server might be new or too overwhelmed but I just really, really wanted a cup of coffee.   They moved us, I still had to wait another 5 minutes for someone to bring a coffee cup and creamer. Here's the part that angered me.... They Still had the same waitress bring our food and bill over 20 minutes later. I really should have asked for a manager, but we love their food and I understand people can be new/make mistakes/etc.  Food was good, so we left happy after the whole ordeal. What made me decide to log on and write this review was that same night, I ended up getting pretty sick, guessing it was the food. I don't think I'll be going back to Chompies anytime soon.... Which makes me sad, because I loved their Gluten Free Bagels...

I called Cactus Jack's after being turned down last week by another "Buy here pay here" dealership in Phoenix. They had the SAME car, yet it had LESS MILES and was at a BETTER PRICE then the other dealership.  Patrick, the sales manager, stayed open late for me to get to the dealership and test drive the car I was interested. He gave me the paperwork that night to fill out, told me what I needed, and the next morning I was driving away with the car....  It was that simple. They are fantastic.......

I drove up around 9/10 am a few days ago and was bummed to realize how many cars were in line ahead of me.  I was pleasantly surprised. I was in and out within less than 30 mins? Friendly and helpful staff. I'll be back. Got me smog approved in the old car and back to the rest of my day.
