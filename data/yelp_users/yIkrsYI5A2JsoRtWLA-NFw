Their bruschetta is good and the wine flows. Servers are nice but sometimes slow. I wouldn't recommend big dinner put here, but great for small groups. Kids are OK but will he bored.

I have been going to this place for years. While I have tried numerous other salons closer to my job in South Chandler, closer to my hair salon in Scottsdale, or even in the same neighborhood as this place & my home, I keep coming back, hence my 5 star rating. Even Dolce's pedis & gel manis don't amount to Nails 8000 in quality (& 2x the price). Keep in mind - while very nice, Ti the mgr is a stickler for cash tips. She's also the best for fake nails (not pedis). I wouldn't regularly see them for my waxing, but Ti is good in a pinch. The gel man is last a strong 3 weeks. The $28 pedi includes hot stone massage. Do it and tip these lovely Vietnamese women well!

Been coming here a long time. Hit & miss with the instructors but 90% of the time you get a goodie. They handle special needs kids well and reward for good behavior and milestones small & large.

Mia is amazing! I was really impressed by her serious expertise and will definitely be back to see her specifically. D-Stress Zone has never let me down. Although I'm not a regular due to the distance from my home and work, I know I can call them and get a great therapist, aesthetician, whatever. :)

Brought my girls here this summer for one week of camp.  each week they had a different theme and this week was the Sound of Music. The staff ensures everyone is included and having fun. At the end of the week on Friday they have a dance they're doing puppetry with marionettes and they're doing a skit in which all the parents are invited.  they take kids going into 1st grade up two kids going into 7th grade. The kids and I are both excited to come back here again for one week in July.

5 stars to Jesse Collman for her hair skills and the salon layout. Its all chair rental, so I can't speak to the other stylists' skills or consistency. There is a shop with jewelry, fun gifts & clothes. There is a cafe. There is skin care, waxing, bronzing, nails. And of course, amazing hair! Jesse is the 3rd stylist I've seen here (others moved) and I have been with her for years.

We got there in the knick of time on a Tuesday night. The location could use a major facelift, but it's friendly, prompt and has the nice student working the counter. And it's ice cream. 31 Flavors and all.

Hands down one of the best studios I've ever been to. The studio, instructors, yogis are friendly, welcoming and come in all varieties. They know what they are doing and have fun while practicing to be well. I heart them.

This used to be where the students went before Tempe Marketplace opened. The staff here are always friendly and the crowd is older Tempe. They could use an update but they are way better than the one on Longmore. This Target has everything I need!

Kalbi is very good. My kids love the Kim bap but they only have it available half the time. The panjan never disappoints. Service isn't the friendliest, but I challenge anyone to find me a friendly Korean joint.

Breakfast burritos are the shiz.  We eat here as a treat when we have time whilst working from home together.  Southwest  is our usual. Salsa IS hot.

The service is super friendly! The general menu items are above average, but the pozole is my favorite. My co-worker orders and loves their nachos. Their service with smiles from the guys helps bring people back.

This was not good. Service was poor, pho Tai was very bland. Spring roll "starter" came out while we were halfway done with our pho. Even though they close at 8:30pm, by 8:15pm they had chairs up, music off and, oh, US EATING. Our server was absent and no one said thank you as we uncomfortably walked out at 8:23pm. With all the other pho restaurants in the vicinity, they don't even come close to competing. Surprised at all the positive reviews.

Amazing guacamole - get it with ghost pepper. Pork belly app - ask for it with tortillas for mini tacos. Drink tequila from the calacas bottle. She's worth it.

One of the best pho and other delights around. The service and owners are so sweet and awesome. They have lots of regulars, Asian and otherwise, which says a lot in my book. My kids' favorite place, and they don't even have crayons.

We had a group of at least 30. Most of us (couples) had resort credit. First they told us they couldn't accommodate the separate bills until we complained. Two patrons NEVER got their meal. Crap. Py.. Some people paid before others got their food. L.A.M.E.

Holy crap! I just witnessed the lady scold a customer using a Groupon! The customer said she had an appt yesterday and left a message to change it, but no one answered or called her back. So LaVie wouldn't take her, saying that she is still considered canceled under 48 hours, which voids her Groupon. Then the lady told the customer how her no-show impedes business and makes other customers wait. She wouldn't stop scolding the customer, and agreed with the customer that yes, she should call Groupon to get her money back if she wants. Whoa, I will never come here again.

This place is so great! The staff, like Albert, are amazing with kids. They inform the kiddo about every step they take as they go about the cleaning & checkup process. Dr. Griff is friendly and brings both the parent and child into the conversation. The movies don't hurt, either. :) Highly recommend!

I love them. I fired SBux for their sweet nectar. Iced nf sugar-free Carmelizer is my summer go-to. In the off months their crazy-hot black coffee or nf Dirty Chai are my orders. The staff has some of the best customer service I have experienced across many industries. They have a huge fan in me. I even drive 2 miles out of the way for mg morning love.

We like them so much! We paid $6 for their club and get a bag with our preferences every time. They are inexpensive, recycle their plastic and recycle their hangers. Plus they are nice, which you don't get every where. We had to go through a few places to find this winner. Very happy!

Isaiah is very knowledgeable and friendly. The hubs ordered chicken enchiladas that were amazing. I had old school pork tenderloin sandwich because it reminds me of Iowa. :) Apple slaw rocked and the space/atmosphere is lovely and full of various potential.

Its a hit and miss at times, but the shop is the nicest in the area. They have a nail bar vs stations with integrated lights for gel curing. A bit pricier, but 10% off with cash. 3 flat screen TVs with a movie selection you can pick from when they are slow. I am surprised they opened next to XO Nails, which has a large and loyal customer base. They get the overflow (like me), but they are never very busy.

Update: 90 mins for a #2 for Claude and 45 minutes for me. They were so inconsistent. Two women had to paint Claude's toes because the first girl (who took forever) COULDN'T PAINT or speak a lick of English; WTF? My time was too short. The owner doesn't pay attention or offer apologies. We are unlikely to return, despite the pretty toes.

Go socialize at their Social Hour from 7 -10pm! They hosted the Junior League Provisional Social and totally hooked us up with their awesome space. Korean bars are VERY rare here and I loved it. Will be back.

We waited a little longer than comfortable to be seated this Sunday morning. However the food is really really good. We had the hash (warning: super spicy delish dish), quiche (yum, needed hot sauce, perfect crust), half order of excellent cheddar biscuits/gravy, and side of tender belly sausage. Cameron our server apparently thought we only needed one cup of coffee, even though we asked for refills twice. Still waiting as I write this in fact. Waiting. Oh! Here he is and now I am taking my refill of coffee to go. Great food, service needs work.
