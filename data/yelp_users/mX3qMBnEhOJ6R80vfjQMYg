Thank you Cheuvront for challenging me. I have grown weary of all the so called wine bars around that boast more college students and second rate wines than actual good ones. I've been meaning to try this place for awhile. It feels super fancy but you can show up casual. When I walked in I felt overwhelmed ( in a good way ) about the great selection of cheeses and wines. You can also get champagne by the glass! Real champagne from France. I felt silly trying to pronounce all the names of the different cheeses and such. Good for them. It's about time my know it all butt was put in her place. I ordered a glass of sparkling white wine called Gruet Brut from New Mexico. Light, airy, refreshing and paired really well with the Abbaye de bellocq. This is a french cheese that was creamy and practically melted in my mouth. To top it off I had one of the best martinis of my life. A chocolate martini. Just imagine: Godiva liqueur, FRESH mint and actual little rounds of chocolate in the glass so you had a reward for finishing. Two complaints: first is what is up with the bathroom? I found it slightly confusing and hot as cuss in there. That should definitely be fixed. Second: according to yelp happy hour started at 9pm but when I arrived i was told that it didn't start til 10pm! I even showed them the yelp announcement. Oh well didn't get happy hour prices but still a good deal in my book. I will definitely return for dinner and their happy hour.

I had been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time, seeing as though they have options for vegetarians like me. We get there and there are only about six people in the restaurant. Our waiter is attentive at first but things slowly grew worse and worse. This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I ordered the veggieball parmigiana , now here's the tricky part apparently. All I asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese. I wanted the  whole sandwich to be meat free and just have non vegan cheese. Simple enough right? Wrong, I thought the server's head was about to pop off. He simply could not grasp this simple order, the sandwich comes with a side so I ordered the salad. So time goes on and he brings out my order, ya not so much. He brings out veggieballs I will give him that, but it's an appetizer not the sandwich I ordered. So he takes it back and brings out my salad. Then he proceeds to bring out my actual sandwich with a side of fries. I didn't ask for fries I asked for the salad side. So now I'll be charged for a salad and fries. I'm with my boyfriend, who is not a vegetarian, and the server says that his order will be out in thirty seconds. TEN minutes go by and my food is getting cold because I would like to eat at the same time as my boyfriend. The server finally comes over and says it's going to be a little while because they made two veggie sandwiches. Why did they do this?! My boyfriend ordered a sausage sandwich! So now that's two food orders they have to throw out because the server is incompetent. Enough was enough. I gulped down my wine and asked for the check. I paid for my salad and my wine because that's all I ate. Nothing was comped and I spent ten bucks on a wilted salad and a glass of wine. Grossly inadequate and unacceptable. It wasn't a busy night and I was not being unreasonable. I will never be back here again.

Um this place is amazing. As my never-ending love affair with outdated technology continues, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find anyone that can repair them. I've had my typewriter for about seven years and finally decided to get a new ribbon. I called in and the owner was very helpful. The replacement was only about $9 and he changed it out for me. He even fixed a key that hadn't worked for who knows how long. The owner definitely loves his job and it shows. He showed me about five typewriters and had me test each one out and I could feel his enthusiasm. Apparently he's been doing this for about forty years. Truly amazing, this is what local business is about. Even though it's a bit of a drive from downtown, I will gladly make the trip.

Love this place! Its super affordable and in a great location. I have always been happy with my hair cuts. But then again I am not a picky person. I'm only paying 12 bucks! If you want a professional hair cut then go to a professional salon. Everyone is really friendly except for the front desk girls. Major attitude from them. Only four stars because of that and the wait times. I had to wait 30 minutes before my stylist was ready. Also they only have weird appointment times available like Wednesdays at 9 am. I'm not working at the moment so it fits my schedule. It probably won't work with others though so you're looking at waiting a week or so to get a decent appointment. Well to the hair. I have come in before with some crazy requests and my hair comes out looking exactly how I want. I have had the side of head shaved and steps cut, had my hair done like Zooey Deschanels' , AND had my hair dyed red. All came out wonderful! I will continue to come here even when I can afford to go to high priced salon.

What has happened to this place?? I booked this appointment with no issues. I was given a nine o clock appointment. Around 8:30 am I get two frantic phone calls saying that they need to reschedule. I'm already at the place at this point since I was driving from downtown. The front desk lady said they would work something out. Alright fine with me. She takes me downstairs where one of the teachers was going to perform the wax. Nope not so much. She keeps mentioning how she didn't know there was an appointment and why did they schedule me? Blah blah blah. As if it was somehow my fault. She also said I needed to wait an additional undetermined amount of time since the wax wasn't heated yet. I gently asked about how long that would take and she didn't know! You're a teacher at a cosmetology school and you don't know when the wax will be heated? The level of incompetence is astounding. As I was left alone I simply walked out of the place, no need to really tell them since they didn't even know I had an appointment anyways right? I'll be paying full price somewhere else. Plus they haven't carried actual Aveda products for quite some time.

So this review is not in regards to the actual food but it involves a completely bizarre and scary incident I had with the owner of this establishment. My boyfriend works in the same building that Lunch Express is located. There are a few parking spots right at the front of the office that are designated for Lunch Express. I parked in one of these spots to sit and wait for my boyfriend to get out of work. Mind you, this was after business hours and Lunch Express was closed.   I'm there not two minutes when this man pulls up next to me in his car and starts laying on his horn. Of course I don't pay attention because I don't make it a habit of engaging with obnoxious people. So he finally stops honking and then proceeds to pull out of the spot, gets behind me and blares on his horn again. Then he backs up, pulls to the right of me and honks that horn again. It's obviously directed at me so when pulls to the left of me, I roll down my window to see what's up.   He then starts screaming at me that I have no right to park here and that I didn't pay for it. Before I could even respond he rolls up his window and starts honking his horn at me. Then he circles my parking spot again! Constantly laying on his horn the whole time, causing a huge scene. At this point I am legitimately terrified so I called my boyfriend out to help me. At this point the man is pulled up again next to me screaming from his car. He couldn't be bothered to get his fatass out I suppose. My boyfriend finally comes to my rescue and the man almost runs him over!! I'm not exaggerating, he was mere centimeters from running over my boyfriend.   What kind of person treats people like this?!  So meanwhile he's screaming and threatening me, saying that he's going to block me in and blasting that god forsaken horn. My boyfriend looked at me surprised and said, "That guy is the owner of Lunch Express." You know how he knows this? My boyfriend has been a paying customer for 8 freaking years. That's how he knows. He sees the owner a few times a week. The man didn't even recognize my boyfriend, or if he did he simply didn't care.   All of this took place over the course of about 5-7 minutes. So we established that he was the owner of Lunch Express and that's why he was upset. Instead of getting out of his car, tapping on my window and politely asking me to move my car, he decides to do a complete 180 and literally terrorize me. This is unacceptable and disgusting behavior. I know these spots are dedicated to the business but that does not give you the right to harass and scare me. I would have gladly moved my car if you hadn't been psychotic. Again, I will reiterate that this was AFTER business hours. Nobody was going to be going to his establishment anyways. I was only planning on being there for about 5 minutes.   Needless to say my boyfriend will not be visiting this place any further and I urge anyone else to be very wary of this very violent, deranged man. Seeing a couple of other reviews here this isn't the first time he's had a horrible attitude. My boyfriend did go to his business this morning to talk it out with him and he denied the whole thing! We both saw you and actually everyone in the whole office building saw what you did. I honestly should have gotten the police involved, that's how scary he was acting. Purposefully trying to run over my boyfriend to threatening me. All of this over a precious car spot??! You're a garbage person who doesn't have the decency to act like a normal human being. You're a pathetic turd who probably gets off on terrorizing women and other people. Please choke on one of your overpriced sandwiches for the good of humanity. Peace!

5 stars? Hell yeah! Why? I have found myself many times wandering the streets with boredom and end up inside Ash and I leave feeling completely satisfied. I always always buy something. I love how there is such a wide selection. Not just Super hero or anime. Lot's of local comics and Drew is super nice! If something isn't there he will order it for me if he can. Knowledgeable and friendly. The location is where it's at man. You can grab a coffee at Cartel and bring it into Ash without having to worry about someone getting all pissy about having liquids too close to the comics. I have literally spent hundreds of dollars here and never regretted it. Sure I can't eat for a week but who needs food when you have all the issues of Optic Nerve to feed your soul? I know it's weird to ask a building to be my boyfriend, but will you? I already have one but he won't mind. I can have two can't I?? Please???

These are my people. After getting lost looking for that damned Neon Museum, we stumbled upon this place. The bartender was amazingly friendly and honored the yelp check-in. The drinks are stiff and the people are friendly. I never want to leave!

Imagine if House of Tricks and La Bocca fell in love and had a baby. Cibo would be their love child. Classy, great vibe and delicious food are some of the highlights to this charming little restaurant. We had a big group and even two that arrived late and the staff was able to accommodate everyone. We ordered at least 5 pizzas and everything was fresh and flavorful. They have a good selection of drinks as well. I wanted a white wine spritzer and they didn't have club soda so I was offered sprite instead to mix with my wine and it actually tasted great! For dessert we all shared one that had nutella AND bananas. Mmmm. I would definitely come here and again and recommend it to all my friends.

Me: Hey can you help me with a piercing I got here a month ago? It seems to be irritated. Maybe the ring needs to be changed. Piercer: You should stop picking it.. Me: I'm not picking it Piercer: Just keep using the salt soaks Me: I have been for a month and it's not working. Piercer: Just keep doing it and come back once it's not so irritated.  I will be the bad guy here and say that in my TEN years of piercings I have never had an experience like this. My friend and I went for the Valentines Day special which was two for one piercings. Everything went well, the place was clean. About a week after the piercings my friend said that hers was becoming really irritated so she changed the ring out and it healed fine. Mine was really irritated and a bubble formed on the side of my nose around the piercing. After a month I went back for help because I had been using the salt soaks everyday and not picking it ( because I'm not 12). Nothing was helping. So in typical hipster fashion the piercer seemed to be placing the blame on me and offered no alternatives to help my situation. He must have thought I was younger and didn't know what I was talking about. I had it pierced in Feb and finally took it out a couple of weeks ago and it healed nicely after I googled what to do and found Lot's of different remedies. I just couldn't believe I paid $80 for this piercing. Next time I get a piercing I will go to Club Tattoo. Corporate chain but at least I get treated like a human being.

Being from California I certainly miss these old hamburger restaurants. Also being vegetarian doesn't help things either. Lenny's fills that void perfectly. They have one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. Prepared in the old fashioned style that I've become used to. Big white bun, shredded iceberg lettuce and tons of thousand Island dressing. The fries are amazing too. This place is a gem. Not all vegetarian food is bad!

I woke up one day and had a huge craving to bake donuts. I checked everywhere for donut pans and could not find them anywhere. I looked up baking supplies on Yelp and found this place. I was like a kid in a candy store. This place had TWO different types of donut pans! It was affordable too. About $10 bucks each. First of all it's easy to get to. Take one bus from downtown Tempe and you're there. When I walked in it was sensory overload. $1 ramekins, Eiffel tower napkins oh my! The clearance section is incredible. I bought a mini pie maker for $4. This place has everything you could ever want. Some things are a little pricey but it seems worth it to me. I also found a container to keep my home made ice cream in. I dropped about $50 overall and it was totally worth it.

ATTENTION HIPSTER DOUCHE BAGS: THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR YOU!! Yea that's right go to Mill ave or whatever place you go to that we've never heard of. This is my type of bar. I'm in my mid twenties and I hate Mill ave. I also dislike all the "hip" bars around town. My idea of a good time is hanging out at a chill place where there are cheap food and drinks and where the pretension is left at the door. I recently went to a Tempe bar where the service was abysmal. I had to interrupt the bartenders conversation TWO times. If I'm paying you money I don't want to have to wave my hands up and down for you to serve me. Especially when it's a slow night. I won't name names but suffice it to say that this bar is not the 'TOPS' at customer service. Back to Draw 10, I came in and used my Yelp check in which is a $5 pitcher of alcohol. $5! Normally they have this special on Tuesdays only but if you check in using your Yelp app you can have it any day of the week. So we got a pitcher of Vodka Tonic. Really good. We also came during happy hour. The best happy hour. Well drinks are $1.50! The happy hour food menu is great too. Another note here if you're a hipster foodie snob this place is also not for you. Typical bar food like $2 french fries and jalapeno tater tots. The biggest reason I will be back is the service. A lot of bars that are popular with the "young" crowd feel they have to have a young mentality towards customer service. For example acting bothered whenever putting in an order. Waiting around forever while they finish talking about where their stupid meaningless band is playing this week. Let me just say I went to Draw 10 on a Friday night and NEVER had to wait to put an order in. It was pretty busy and as soon as I walked up to the bar I was served. Incredible. The staff was very friendly as well. I do admit I live in downtown Tempe which makes riding to Draw 10 really easy. It's about  a 10-15 minute bike ride from Mill ave. I'm giving Draw 10 5 stars but I wish I could give it ten. It's nice to know there are still quality bars around that treat their customer's right.

intr.v. whored, whoring, whores   1. To compromise one's principles for personal gain.   I came here a year ago for Karaoke. They treated me like dirt and acted as if they had never heard of such a thing.Tonight some of my friends decided to go and said it was awesome. I decided to give it another chance. BIG mistake. The host of Karaoke night fits the above definition to a T.  I am not one to make personal attacks but this guy kept promising me I would be next and NEVER played my song. I was a paying customer. Let me sing my damn song. Oh but the guy that slipped his tongue in his mouth got to sing before me even though he didn't show up until an hour after I did. I even was able to guess the song he played between each song: April March, Chick Habit. No one else knew that! He let fat pigs and sluts sing before me and I was there when there were only like 5 people in the bar. They paid him off to sing their crappy songs. Granted I'm not the best singer in the world but at least I can follow the lyrics and carry a tune! I will never, ever come here again. Three words: KISS MY ASS!!

I purchased a Groupon and chose the Phoenix pub crawl route. It was pretty miserable that night and raining but the bus pulled through. They had hot chocolate waiting which went really well with the peppermint schnapps my fellow bus mate had. I chose to sit on the upper deck which was a mistake. Only because it was filled with about a dozen loud slutty females screaming at the top of their lungs. After the first stop I escaped to the lower level which was extremely chill. The bus was a little late so the first stop felt rushed so I didn't get a drink but the next ones we went to I drank my heart out. I love that I can drink on this bus legally. I normally sneak a nip or two on the bus or light rail so it was nice to be able to do so without having to worry about being arrested! We went to Irish themed pubs and ended the night at the Copper Blues. I wound up ditching the bus at the last stop and taking a cab home after I heard about a couple having loud sex in the bathroom. I would go for another ride and maybe explore the Scottsdale pub crawl. It is really cold on the bus so dress warm. I don't think the heater works. Also beware of loud drunk females. It is a very interesting way to spend an evening that's for sure!

This place rocks. Dirt cheap produce and very vegetarian friendly. Tofu galore! There's so much to choose from here that I always leave with more than I intended to buy. It's right by the last stop on the lightrail so it's really easy to get to. I do a lot of my shopping here and I would definitely recommend!

I love love love that there is place close to where I live off Mill Ave that's not a haven for douche bags. The Center Bistro is charming and elegant and the food is above par. I always crave a nice fancy drink that doesn't put me out $12 or $15 dollars and this place satisfies my craving. I ordered a drink that was made with blood Orange vodka and champagne! So good. The waitress was really friendly and even topped off our glasses with some more champagne for no extra charge. My friend and I split a salad that had walnuts and a creamy nut crusted cheese that didn't stand a chance between the two of us. We also ordered the mac and cheese which is one of the best options on the menu. My boyfriend ordered the tacos with their homemade salsa. They were a little small but what they lacked in size they made up for in flavor. The salsa is some of the best salsa I have ever had in my life. We went on a Friday night and an awesome band was playing that took requests. They played Fleetwood Mac for me! I can't remember the name of the band and that makes me sad. They played a lot of 90s too which is always great in my book. It wasn't crowded at all so if you get out of work and want a nice chill place to eat and drink in peace without some bros hooting and hollering or having to listen to some 21 year old female talk about her hair, this is the place for you. I would give it 5 stars if it was open on weekends. Hopefully that will change with time. Check it out if you want something off the beaten path and are tired of dealing with all the weirdos on Mill Ave.

Canteen. My home away from home. I am here almost every Friday. One of the first times I ever came here the night started innocently enough. Me and a couple of friends decided to hit up the happy hour we heard so much about. It did not disappoint. Next thing I knew I had 4 margaritas and about three house shots. I wake up the next day and there are about 3 or 4 bottles of Champagne and about a dozen beer bottles. My throat was hurting from all the Rock band that I played and I had the worst hangover of my life. From then on I was hooked! If you start your night at Canteen you're bound to have an interesting evening. I usually stick with the regular Margaritas and house shots. I normally don't use the well Tequila though because you can substitute any other Tequila for I think an extra $2. The tacos are delicious and I want to just rub their Guacamole all over my body because it's so good. I prefer sitting inside but you have to know where to sit. By the bar is your best bet. One of my complaints is that the music is WAY too loud. I overhead one of the servers asking the owner if she could turn up the music and I almost screamed Nooooo!! I like to be able to have some sort of conversation with the person I'm with without screaming at the top of my lungs. All in all Canteen is a great way to start your night but once happy hour is over and the Mill ave crowd starts coming in it's a whole other story. But it's a must for one of the best happy hours in Tempe!

Ahh I would walk over hot coals to eat here! They have a new item everyday. Also some mainstay items like the veggie burger that's to die for. There's even a little garden that you can walk through to see some of the produce that they use. So inexpensive as well. You can take advantage of the frequent buyer card. 6 punches and your meal is free! I've sampled a lot of items here like the bleu cheese pizza, fresh baked brownies, couscous and an Asian salad that I have tried to replicate but cannot for the life of me get the spices right. I ride a bike so it's a little out of the way for me but I have been known to take hour lunches just to take advantage of their savory meals. Everyone there is so friendly too and I have never had a bad experience. And right next to this cafe is a yummy coffee bar where they serve Italian soda. I don't know how a place like this exists but I am so glad I have had a chance to experience it. Thanks to Bonnie G. for pushing me in the right direction!  P.S. Try their iced tea located next to the soda fountain. You will thank me later..

So I stumbled in here last night at 1 am on a Tuesday completely starving. I needed something to soak up the alcohol so I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza. All they had were slices which was perfect because that's all I wanted. Plus it was reverse happy hour so it kinda defeated the purpose of the pizza but it was totally worth it. I have been here several times and I have to say that I would only recommend coming here on Tuesdays after midnight because it was really chill. You can't get a whole pizza at that time but you can get several slices to plug your gut. The bartender was a little weird. Or I could have just been really tipsy. Either way it was really empty and there was plenty of seating outside. Definitely recommend if you're wasted on Mill ave on a week night.

OMG. This is the Palo Verde lounge but clean!! I came here tonight and the gin and tonics were only $2.50 each and it's a Friday night!! They also have bar food which is decent ( we got the french fries,served with ketchup and mayonnaise). There's also a veggie burger. I didn't try it but I will the next time I come. When I first walked up they were playing Alanis Morissette. Nothing but 90s throughout the night. I also met a nice dog named Molly which should be the mascot for the bar.The only complaint I have is that there is only one stall in the ladies room. There needs to be at least 2 people come on.. I also just want to point out that they had bubblegum vodka. BUBBLEGUM. Enough said. The service was great and there so many seating options. I moved three times because I wanted to take advantage of every seat. There's no stupid college kids in town so it was really enjoyable. There's also Modern World next door so if you meet some guy for a one night stand, you can gear up next door to make sure it's a pleasurable night. The bar is DIRECTLY across the street from the lightrail so there's no excuse for you not to go.. Go now...What are you waiting for???

Of course I was a huge fan of Madcap so naturally I love the Royale. I saw Kidnapped here, very intense movie where one guy actually left because he couldn't take it! The space is cute and cozy. They sell DVDs of interesting movies which is a nice addition. I really wish they had a liquor license but what are you going to do it's Mesa? Which brings up another point. The location. So silly. Such a silly location. It's too out of the way so I will never go there. Maybe when the light rail expands I will be there more often. They do show great movies and have an awesome vibe.

Wonderful wonderful!! Finally a place in downtown Tempe where I can get breakfast. I am an early riser ( 7:30 am on weekends!) and nothing is ever open that early. NCounter answered my prayers. I ordered the eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon. So delicious! It's really easy to make the hollandaise sauce too tart. So not the case here. It was very filling and I had the potatoes on the side. My boyfriend got the Pear omelette and it was sweet and salty, the perfect combination. For a drink I ordered an iced chai tea. Perfect! I have tasted iced chais that have tasted like soap before so I was pleasantly surprised when this didn't taste like it. Did you know they also serve breakfast cocktails?? That's right for only $5 bucks you can get a mimosa, Bellini, or bloody Mary. Most places charge like $7. It's within walking distance from my house and steps away from the light rail. Whether you are a meat eater or non meat eater there is bound to be an item that will satisfy your palette.

This place is great. It's in a really convenient location and the staff is really friendly. It was incredibly easy to make an appointment online. I was even five minutes late and I was seen right away no problem. I didn't feel as if they were trying to sell me anything either. I went in for a brow wax and it was free! My brows came out looking amazing. I'll definitely be back!

I walked here in the heat and was immediately greeted with an ice cold beer. For free! It was a delicious IPA and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. There were even snacks. I also had another sample of their Camelback ale. Both were heaping samples, almost a full cup. The tour was fun and informative. The co owner George even gave me and my boyfriend a ride to the lightrail stop!! We didn't bring our bikes. So awesome.  Definitely recommend. Lovely way to spend a Saturday afternoon.

I love you I love you I love you Barrio Queen! I just ate here about an hour ago and couldn't wait to write a review. First of all the location is great, if you don't drive like me the bus will drop you off about 5 minutes away or its just a short bicycle ride from downtown Tempe. Couple of drawbacks but I know this is because they just opened. They didn't have a Tequila list so I had to rely on the waitress to pick something for me. It worked out great because it was delicious. The second is that the portions are a little small but the prices are more than affordable so I can fill up on other things that are on the menu. I started with the vasito. Delicious and tangy! I had two tacos, one was the barrio pollo and the cochinita pibil. Both were very spicy. I like this but others may not. Both were beyond perfection for me. My boyfriend ordered the huitlacoche quesadilla, the "Mexican truffle" and the al pastor taco. The 'dilla had just the right amount of wonderful cheese. I ended with the flan. It was very tiny and not enough for two people so you might want to get more than one if you're planning on sharing. I left very satisfied and extremely happy that I finally found a restaurant that can satisfy my craving for delicious, affordable Mexican food.

I'm glad there is a new addition to Mill ave that I can get down with. This little shop just opened so there wasn't a lot to choose from especially for the bigger gal. The four star review is for what they will hopefully become. There were some cute items and also a large section for men which is rare for vintage clothing stores. The staff was friendly especially Cory. There's an extensive collection of vintage shirts that range from $10 to $18. Dresses about $24 each. Some items weren't priced though since it just had a soft opening today. I hope this business does well and can't wait to come back once they have worked out the kinks.

My sisyphean ordeal successfully ended here today. I spent a full Saturday searching all of phoenix for a stereo receiver that would work with my equipment. Pretty much everyone I encountered was indifferent and unhelpful. As I sat on my bed utterly defeated, a glimmer of hope emerged. Enter the Record Room. I had been here a couple of years ago and remembered it being a pretty cool place. So I called and spoke with the owner who seemed genuinely concerned and extremely helpful. He had one receiver and it was only twenty bucks. Could it be?? I was worried it wouldn't work but he assured me if it didn't I could return it. Sold! I purchase the beast, my boyfriend hooks it up and out comes pure joy. My dreams came true! Super affordable and it works with my antiquated record player and tape deck. Now I sit back while the soothing sounds of Morrissey, Cat Stevens and Lou Reed float dreamily around my weary head...

There was a time when I would smoke a bowl or two and trot down to Melt for a couple of scoops of ice cream and get in and get out. Those days are long over. I went last night and the line was out the door! That's not necessarily a bad thing mind you. I'm just a lazy bastard who'd rather walk over in my slippers and grab some ice cream and bounce back to my house. Their selection is amazing and the Cap'n Crunch Berries ice cream I had yesterday solidified my deep love for this place. They're open extremely late which works out for this late night stoner. Service is usually pretty good too, occasionally I'll get an indifferent hipster but that's to be expected. The ice cream prices are reasonable and the flavor is always on point. I deducted one star because the Dude cannot abide the fact that they charge about $4 for a bag of Takis. We all know you can get a giant bag from food city for like a $1 fool.

Called in for delivery and the guy taking the order was so obnoxious. He couldn't write down a simple phone number. Yea and 27 dollars for a large pizza with garlic?? No. Just so much no. This isn't Los Angeles, it's downtown phoenix so don't kid yourself. Way too expensive for a pizza. It's good but not that good. Also, $3 per topping?! Tessio's charges 50 cents per topping. Are these limited edition or endangered toppings? The audacity.

This center offers a variety of educational and social services. HIV testing, counseling and even yoga classes. The volunteer staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The vast library contains Queer  subjects such as 'And The Band Played On' and 'Dykes To Watch Out For.' There is a membership fee but it's easily affordable. Five dollars a month for students and ten dollars for non students. This is a wonderful center that I'm glad it's part of the community.

I've been passing by this place for awhile and I finally stopped in today. The inside is really neat and organized. There's a lot to choose from too. I spotted a New Order album behind the counter but *sigh* it was $65. I did see some affordable gems though like Santo and Johnny and old favorites like Led Zeppelin. They also offer turntables and other accessories. I wasn't expecting too much until I strolled over to The Smiths section... I spied with my little eye an import copy of The Queen is Dead. It set me back $35 bucks but it's in amazing shape and sounds beautiful. I feel that it's rare to find a real life non reissue Smiths album (yes I know I sound like a pretentious twat) and I was pleasantly surprised. That's an understatement, I was jumping up and down squealing with delight. You've won my heart In groove, don't ever change.

I live about five minutes from here and I'm so glad to see more businesses opening here in downtown instead of those dreaded condos. I've never been to the old location so I don't have a way to compare the two. In any case, it's a nice wide open space with a huge selection. The only thing wrong are the prices. Egads.  I saw a cute little hat and come to find out it's $35. Seems a little steep to me. Now if this hat belonged to Jackie O then you could justify the price. They have a pretty good men's selection too. I understand this is vintage but come on. Well if you have a little extra money to burn then this is your place. I suppose I'm just an old cheapskate who'd rather hunt for scraps at Goodwill.

An amazing new place where zines are bought and sold. There are many different ones to chose from that hail from locally and beyond. Part art, gallery, library and community space. Soon they'll have meet-ups and workshops. This is a great little place that supports writers and artists. Check it out!

Tucked away in a slightly sketchy, industrial area. Works for me so I finally decided to check out this spot. I've driven by dozens of times but today was the day. If you blink you might miss it, but they usually have signs outside.   It is way bigger inside than it looks so that was a pleasant surprise. There's a pretty good selection too. One room is dedicated to jazz and another room is dedicated to rock, rap and classical music. There's a good mix of new releases and not so new releases. It's very well organized and each record is sleeved which I appreciate. They also sell record players and other audio equipment, like cassette players and receivers.   Prices are reasonable enough, I imagine the location enables them to offer good deals on records. It's always a good time when you can find a good condition copy of The Mary Jane Girls, natch.
