Fabulous restaurant. Went with my girlfriends for Sunday brunch and it was fantastic from the moment we walked in. Our waitress was incredibly friendly (and even commented on how pretty I was - MAJOR tip for her obviously). The atmosphere was relaxed with a dim setting and apparently very popular for Sunday brunch (it even has its own menu). If you get to stop by, order the chicken tortilla soup or the egg benedict. DELICIOUS!

This is a really neat place to have lunch. You place your order inside and then take a seat outside in the patio. It looks like a small Trader Joe's when you're inside with an antique feel to it.   You really can't go wrong with anything you order. Everything is fresh. The bread is amazing. The sandwiches are huge. The soup is full of flavor.   We found another new go-to-spot for lunch!

Yesterday was my first time trying Indian food (don't judge meeeee!) and I'm now HOOKED! Anyone who hasn't tried Indian food, or is curious and wants to sample - go here.   This review is based on the lunch buffet, which beats out Chinese buffets any day of the week. You have a selection of 9-10 choices, plus dessert. The neatest part is the variety of food switches every day, so you're never eating the same thing over and over. Yesterday's buffet consisted of chicken masala (chicken, spices, tomato sauce cooked), daal makhani (lentil soup), bhindi (bombbbb okra!), chicken curry... and a ton of other goodies (dessert was shahi kheer - basmati rice pudding with almond and pistachios).   My only complaint was the bread, as it felt like it was covered in oil. However, for $11.99 and all you can eat - I don't really care.  Side note: they play this channel on their TV that's an Indian version of MTV - so freaking entertaining.

Groupon is running a package deal - $25 for three car washes. I was hesitant to purchase based on the reviews, but my curiosity got the best of me.  Upon completion: - my car came back in one piece - no one stole anything - the car came back clean - got a free oil change - smells like fresh pine breeze (mmmm!) - service guys didn't have an attitude or try to upsell  So, I don't know if I just got lucky... or if everyone is a bit dramatic when it comes to their car washes. 4 stars and a repeat customer.

My co-worker took me here and I'll forever love her for it.   Best. Gumbo. EVER.  And the garlic bread. And the shrimp cocktail. And the crawfish.   I think I know what I'll be eating for lunch tomorrow. You should too!

This place is a complete joke. My cousin is getting married in June and we decided to check this place out to see if they knew how to add custom alterations to a wedding dress for a reasonable price. It was a waste of time.  The lady who greeted us was friendly. She had my cousin try on her wedding dress and went to the back room. The owner came out and I had to bite my tongue the entire time we were there.   She criticized my cousin's choice in the bra she was wearing. I'm sorry, it's not her wedding day and she's not wearing the bra made for the dress. It's just a damn fitting and none of your business. My cousin explained what she wants for alterations and that was beyond her mental capacity, apparently. "Honey, that's just a jacket." No, it's obviously not a jacket if we specifically described everything BUT a jacket. She was incredibly rude and I had to stay on my phone the entire time to not flip out on her. How do you own a bridal alterations business and not know how to speak to customers?   On top of the attitude problem and inexperience, she tried to quote my cousin at $550. Such a waste of time. I would hope she can read these Yelp reviews and adjust herself and business accordingly.

I couldn't wait to get home so I can write my review for this David's Bridal location. My baby cousin is getting married in eight months (tear, tear) and we booked an appointment to try on wedding dresses last night. We had suuuuch an amazing experience and I'd love to share the details!  Our sales lady, Samantha, was eager to help us as soon as we got there. She asked the regular questions (what size are you? what color are you looking for? what's your budget?) and after getting a feel for what we were looking for, let us run wild in the store (yay!) Well, here's the kicker: my cousin wears the head scarf (we're Muslim) and that makes picking a wedding dress much harder than it already is. Surprisingly, it didn't bother or worry Samantha at all.   So, wedding dresses started piling on in the fitting room. My cousin is sooooo picky as it is, so everything she tried on wasn't what she wanted. On top of that, she made me take 10 pictures for each dress at every angle possible. We didn't agree on any of the dresses (my taste is much better than hers, ha!) so by 8:00pm, I was OVER IT. Samantha kept a smile on her face the entire time and continued to go above and beyond to satisfy my cousin. There's a small stage (where you try on dresses) and they were playing AWESOME music, so I jumped on the stage and started singing/dancing. Another sales rep would have tried to say something such as, "Company policy says you need to have a seat," but Samantha was just laughing and enjoying everything. She definitely deserves praise just for dealing with me.   To top it all off, we found the perfect dress! My cousin actually went with a dress Samantha picked out! When we were leaving, she said we were the most fun group she has had in a long time. Wedding dress shopping is usually catastrophic (especially with a Bridezilla) but this was truly a memorable experience my baby cousin and I shared. Thank you Samantha and I hope your manager sees this! 10 stars if I could!

I know, I know... another salon review from me, but I can't help it. I was meeting a girlfriend at Native New Yorker next door and spotted this very classy salon. Well, I broke a nail over the weekend and I HAD to fix it since I'm super OCD about my nails. I walked in and met SUCH a friendly group of ladies. Judy was my nail tech and worked with my fussiness with no problem. She has been doing nails since the 1970's! Even though it was only one nail, she made it look just as natural as the rest of them and I had a great time conversing with her. They also do hair and waxing here! I highly recommend this salon.

Came here for the first time today and I'll definitely be back! Service is amazing... my waitress was so sweet and made sure everything was perfect. The food is great - make sure you order the cinnamon french toast or one of their benedicts. They serve coffee and water in large jugs so you don't have to ask for refills, which I thought was wonderful and convenient. They also have the calories listed on all their menu items, so don't come here if you're trying to stick to a diet. Mine went out the window today!

This is by far the best animal hospital in Phoenix. They took care of my teacup chihuahua when she had a terrible ear infection; the veterinarian is a sweetheart. She speaks in a very soft, calm voice and it's so easy to see how much she cares for and adores these animals.   Also, I found a stray Labrador a few weeks ago. This beautiful, HUGE dog just showed up at my garage and I had no idea what to do. I grabbed bowls of water and food and let him sit in my house for awhile. I called Arrow Hospital, told them I found a stray and they told me to bring him in immediately.   They took such good care of him. The lady at the front counter (I wish I could remember her name) found a microchip, but it wasn't registered within Maricopa County. She went the extra mile and contacted several people before deciding to keep him overnight. They found him a foster home a couple days later and they NEVER even considered contacting the Humane Society (which I am eternally grateful for that). Before going to Arrow, I went to Petsmart and had a terrible experience. The veterinarian was way too rough with my teacup and everything was overly priced. I'm so glad I found this clinic. I would give this place 10 stars if I could!

I feel like I'm constantly on the hunt for new salons... it's like an unhealthy obsession of mine (kind of like Rand H. and his buffet chase, haha). Anyway, I hit gold today! Like Julie says, it's a one stop shop for EVERYTHING! Nails - check. Waxing - check. Hair - check. Clothes/accessories - check.   Joy and Becky are dolls. They're very hospitable. I was probably whining about hungry I was (like always) and they brought me PIZZA AND WINE. Who does that at a salon? I was sold after that.   I found them through DealChicken... the special was a hot stone pedicure (that feels amazing, by the way) and a shellac manicure... only $29. Then, I find out a shellac manicure is only $15 at this place! For all you female yelpers, you know you can't find a shellac manicure for anywhere under $25. It's also really nice to be able to speak to your nail tech in English, and she replies in perfect English... no  "$5.00 dollar more's" here!   My nails and toes look absolutely fab, too. Repeat customer foreverrrrrrrrr.

Based on the other reviews, it seems my girlfriends and I have been lucky whenever we stop in for dinner/happy hour. Our waitresses (especially today - I wish I got her name) are very sweet and accommodating. I don't eat pork, and they always substitute and replace menu items to make sure I can order what I want. This location's set-up is better than the one on 61st (larger and with music) so we always come here.   To be honest, I'm a Yen junkie (their happy hour sucked me in)...  but whenever me and the girls want to switch it up, we always drop by Ah-So and enjoy ourselves.

The view from our room. The Compass. Cleaning staff all day long. The jacuzzi and pools. Stellar customer service. The gym. Spacious, beautifully decorated rooms. The cafe and lounges. The area and all it has to offer.  Not to mention, we nabbed it at a killer price via Priceline.  The reason for four stars instead of five: valet parking = $27 a day, ouch. Wifi = $10 a day, yikes.   Nevertheless, I'm pretty sure many babies will be born from staying at this lovely hotel.

So my new obsession lately has been soul food and I knew I had to check this place out. I have never had chicken and waffles (something about sweet and sour mixing altogether just threw me off) but my girlfriends told me I'd be a simple minded b**** not to try it out. Okay, fine, bring it out.  ... along with the soul food platter, which consists of one HUGE piece of catfish, one piece of chicken (your choice on which part you want) smothered with gravy and onions, two sides (get the mac & cheese/beans over rice) AND CORNBREAD!   After several of my arteries clogged and I couldn't breathe, we paid our bill and swore this would be our new Sunday spot. It will be yours too!

This place is the best auto shop I've ever been to in ALL of Phoenix! I took my car in not even knowing what was wrong with it... all I knew is all the engine lights were on and that bothered me (I know, typical female not taking care of her car) so I took it to to Simon's. Being a woman, I'm always hesitant to visit a mechanic because they mostly try to scam you or have you pay way more than necessary. Simon's was the complete opposite... they were unbelievably honest. He fixed the engine lights, did an oil change, fixed the tires and countless other things. I wasn't even there for 30 minutes and they were done with the car. The staff is super friendly and I can't stress how HONEST they are. It was ridiculously inexpensive too! 5 stars, best mechanic!

Okay, so I'm realllyyyyy freaking picky when it comes to my wings. I don't do Hooters wings. I don't do Buffalo Wild Wings. I don't do Pizza Hut wings. I think I've only had one dozen wings that I went kind of nuts over... and that was yesterday at Long Wong's.  Luckily, one of my girlfriends knew how ridiculous I am when it comes to wings but insisted we check this place out. Ghetto area. The girl at the counter wore black lipliner. The customers looked like they just got out of prison...  HOWEVER! The wings were out of this world. Saucy, full of flavor, and cheap. Extra veggies, extra ranch... no charge. We ate so many wings + chili cheese fries, and I felt like a heffer when we were done. SUCCESS!

I never thought I'd be leaving a review for a grocery store, but last night's experience at the deli was so God-awful.   I had to pick up a few items for the house and suddenly craved fried chicken. Rather than going to nasty KFC, I decided to pick some up from their deli.  The lady who takes your order is rude. She was talking to a co-worker while I was waiting to place my order, and didn't stop talking to said co-worker until I said, "excuse me - should I come back?"  Then I ordered the 8 piece (for me and the family) with two sides. The sides aren't listed on the menu, so I asked her what the sides were. She proceeded to (without even looking at me) point to the right and said "there."  The sides were terrible. The mac n cheese was almost gone. No mashed potatoes. I was left with seafood salad and coleslaw. I take everything home and was so livid when I took the first bite of chicken. There was NO CHICKEN on the inside. How is that even possible? It was just burnt skin.   I would have been better off at KFC.

Not to sound like a broken record... but everyone here is right. I would honestly give this place ZERO stars if I could.   My best friend and I came here today to enjoy a nice lunch and walked out five minutes later. There was a man in glasses who greeted us and started getting our menus. My girlfriend said, "we'd like to sit outside." He didn't hear her or stopped paying attention because another server showed up (I believer her name is Samantha) and started ARGUING with him... right in front of us! Then he tried to seat us in the dining area and I repeated what my friend said: we want to sit outside. Apparently he couldn't seat us outside, so we had to wait for Samantha to come back. Then, another server showed up and asked if we had been helped, and we told her we were still waiting to be seated. Samantha shows up and starts arguing with BOTH of the servers, and then the guy decides to walk us out to the patio instead of her. She rolls her eyes and says, "well I guess I don't know what the hell is going on so yeah..." as we walked past her.  We were seated at a dirty table. Our waiter told us he would get a busboy to clean off the table before taking our order. We waited... and waited... and waited... until finally a new server (what the hell?) shows up. His name is Tito. "Yo, my name is Tito and I'll be ya'll server today." You're kidding, right? I snapped at that point. First of all, don't talk to me like we're in the hood. Second of all, where's the busboy?! So, I told him we're still waiting for a busboy to clean off the table. "Oh, my bad. I'll go get that for ya'll real quick." No. We walked out.   I know I write this in most of my reviews, but I am so sympathetic to servers and busboys. My family owns a restaurant and I know exactly what they go through... but as busy as it gets and as irritated as we are, we NEVER show it to the customers. Our servers also speak English, not ebonics.  So, ended up going to a place called Scramble. Amazing... about to write a 5 star review for them instead.

It's just not worth it to go here. The service is a hit or miss - some waitresses are helpful; some are bimbos. The food isn't that great... you can definitely find better. The inside setup... well, we had to sit outside because of it. I wouldn't go back.

This is by the far the best bakery in Phoenix! I've been going to Baker Wee for years and my crazy cake ideas have been over-the-top year after year. They always have so much patience with my tedious details, and everything comes out perfect in the end. I've put in orders for baby shower cakes, birthday cakes, and wedding cakes... and not just your normal cakes, either! I wish I could post pictures of how the cakes turn out in the end... absolutely fabulous. Well, for example, it was my best friend's birthday and I wanted a Christian Louboutin shoebox cake, with a doll-like figure on top that looks exactly like my best friend, with shoe boxes and tiny vodka bottles (lol) and my God, it was incredible when they brought it out. I absolutely love this place - 10 stars if I could!

5 cakes and a year later... this is still, hands down, the most amazing bakery in Phoenix. They have surprised me every single time - each cake has been absolutely flawless. I always receive compliments on how beautiful they look and how delicious they are. I'm pretty sure my entire family and group of friends all order their cakes from Baker Wee now. Check out the pictures! :D

I don't know what else to say about this place that hasn't already been said... but it is honestly the BEST Mediterranean spot in the valley. Gyros, shawarma, hummus, french fries, kabob... and get this: they also make homemade pasta! Absolutely delicious. It's a family owned restaurant and I had such a nice conversation with the owner; she's a sweetheart and is hands on with everything about the business. ALWAYS order the tzatziki sauce with everything you get!

Hi Health vs. GNC? I'd definitely choose Hi Health. There's not much to say for this particular location except for the customer service. The lady who assisted in my selection was extremely friendly and so patient. She gave me the pros and cons on so many items and I ended up purchasing a few things. Everything I bought worked out perfectly and I have her to thank for that. 5 stars for excellent customer service!

If you're ever looking for the perfect date-night-spot... you just found it.   Dim lights, sexy music, amazing decor... and lots of delicious alcohol. Wine and champagne selection is FABULOUS. They let you sample the wine before ordering the glass... which is a foolproof way of getting more tipsy than you anticipated... OH WELL.   No judging, but honestly, I ordered their Tuscany pizza, lol. I WAS HUNGRY! Surprisingly, pizza and wine are perfect together. They are very light on the sauce, so if you prefer heavy sauce... let them know ahead of time.   Not to mention, the bartenders are very easy on the eyes. I was on a date, though, so I had to keep myself in check. If you're not, enjoy the eye candy! ;)

We found our new Sunday night spot! This place is perfect for any type of crowd... rock and metal (downstairs) while hip hop heads and sha sha shake it girls (upstairs). Cheaper drinks than most of Old Town. Bouncers aren't dicks. Aaaaand there's a big panda that walks around and dances with everyone. DOPE.

This resort is beautiful - plenty of trees and greens everywhere to make it feel like you're somewhat out of a desert setting.   Rooms are much more spacious than you'd expect - a lack of toiletries in the bathroom but I always bring my own anyway.  Five stars for the fabulous mini-bar in the room and very friendly staff. I'd definitely stay here again. Priceline offers this as a great deal if you bid your own price - we nabbed it at $60 a night after having a terrible experience at a different "resort" in Scottsdale.

Anyone who is looking for authentic, Persian cuisine - stop looking! Tasty Kabob is by far the best establishment I've been to across the country. My fiancé ordered a dinner entree of lamb kabob skewers, basmati rice and salad. I ordered a chicken kabob and kufta kabob (koobideh in Farsi, minced ground beef in English) with basmati rice and salad. There is a nice lady who greets you and takes care of your order when you first arrive; I found out later she is the owner. So when I asked for the regular kufta kabob plate (2 skewers) - she recommended I try a mixed plate instead. She was right! The mix of chicken and kufta gave it such a better taste than kufta by itself. There is a short wait time (thank God) because we had just left the gym and we were famished. Happy as hell that we didn't have to wait a long time, we devoured our plates. It was absolutely delicious, and I cannot forget to mention how huge the portion is. I just wish I took my usual pictures for my fellow Elites and Yelpers so you all can run over here tomorrow.   And whomever ends up coming here, send me notes and post the pictures! You won't regret it.

There is absolutely no reason to go to any other hookah lounge in Vegas. I honestly wish the hookah lounges were like this in Scottsdale. You walk in and immediately feel the Mediterranean ambiance... the decor is unreal. The hookahs last more than two hours and you get a box of samples to choose from. The drinks are strong. The food is SO good. We can't wait to go back.

Whyyyy did I come here on a Monday? Well, it was *supposed* to be to study so I can kick ass at finals... that didn't happen.  I drank way too much of their delicious coffee... and the fabulous bartender convinced me to add Baileys - bad idea.  So, study session goes out the window. Music + drinks =  a social gathering with fellow lushes, such as myself... and now I'm posting tipsy Yelp reviews. Thanks Lux Cafe!

Short summary of Part Two of our Vegas weekend, since I don't remember half of the details anyway:  Saturday night of girlfriend's birthday weekend. Six BEAUTIFUL women on my arm. Upper level table at Pure in the White Room. So many shots. Crazy live DJ. The drinks are INSANE here. And, *if* you happen to get bored - you can shimmy your way over to the Red Room to bump 'n' grind the rest of the night away (strictly hip-hop and R&B) or take the elevator to the rooftop and keep dancing there.

Short summary of Part One of our Vegas weekend, since I don't remember half of the details anyway:  Girlfriend's birthday weekend. Friday night - upstairs table at the Bank. Total view of the club. Fabulous bottle service. Live crowd. Insane DJ. So many beautiful people. Way too much dancing. I still can't feel my legs. LOVE this place.

The view alone deserves an excellent review. This restaurant is located inside the Hyatt Regency hotel... a circular shaped building that spins (yes, spins) to give you a rotating view of the entire city. It's absolutely beautiful and the ambiance is incredibly romantic.   I ordered the Double Cut Lamb Rack and he ordered the Angus Ribeye. The meat was cooked exactly the way we requested... we both prefer medium and the chef figured out the perfect balance of not to bring it out bloody - but not overcooked either. We finished off with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake, some fancy chocolate cake and a red wine our server recommended. I definitely LOVED the dessert more... SO much so that he had to remind me how many hours we would be in the gym tomorrow. Talk about a sugar buzz kill...  The wait staff are friendly and consistently check on you. We didn't have to wait for water refills or the bill to come out. I was definitely impressed.  It is, however, a pricey restaurant (prepare to spend about $150 for two people) but I think it was well worth it.

We came to Olive & Ivy on the last day of my boyfriend's vacation and it made for the perfect ending. I can't compliment our server, Tim, enough for his excellent customer service. We went with lamb meatballs, hummus, and the fritto mizzo (sp) appetizers and were blown away! My boyfriend owns restaurants in California and it takes excellent flavors, textures and quality of food to make him happy. He was so impressed with everything (especially their beer) and we couldn't thank Tim enough for his wonderful attitude and lovely approach. We would have stayed to thank his manager but his flight was leaving in an hour (we got way too caught up with enjoying our dinner). I'm hoping the manager will see this review and thank Tim for his selection in food, beer and being the best waiter we had this weekend!

My husband took me here for our one-year wedding anniversary and I am hooked! I even asked him, "how are we ever going to eat rib eye steak at home again?!"   5 star food. It's an unbelievable experience. Get the rib eye steak (it's 22 oz though so come huuuungry) and get the lobster mashed potatoes. The steak literally melts off your fork and into your mouth. The baked mac and cheese is also out of this world. I couldn't finish my plate because I had a skin tight outfit on and didn't want a belly, but next time I am coming in a big sweater and pigging out.   5 star service. Our wait staff was exceptional. Every time they arrived to or left the table, they told us "happy anniversary!" and even brought out a chocolate cake to celebrate.   I can't waaaaait to go back.

Spare yourself. There are so many places to eat in this area and Village Inn should not be on your list.  Ordered a to-go breakfast (first mistake) and the waitress who took the order apparently wasn't used to questions. "Can you replace pork with turkey?" "Ummmm I don't know." Uh, what?  I ordered the steak (medium) and eggs and my order was a pile of blob, with well done steak, which couldn't be torn apart because it was made of rubber. BFF orders french toast... turns out to be bread with generic strawberry jam.   It was so bad, we returned the order and went somewhere else. Don't lower your breakfast standards!

This has to be the NICEST group of people I've ever dealt with at Chase. Mind you, this location is inside a Fry's grocery store, but they still provide all the services a normal Chase has... without the wait, long lines and ditzy tellers filing their nails.   I always come here no matter what. It's convenient because it's in the area, and I love that I can get groceries/bath products all in one trip. If you're in this neighborhood, check this branch out.

My best friend and I are sushi junkies. She introduced me to Koi (isn't this how you really spell it?) about a year ago. We loved it the first time we went and because it's near our homes, we figured it would be our go-to-place for sushi and happy hour.  We were wrong. The second time we went, we had brought another girlfriend along. All of a sudden, the sushi went from amazing to bleh. The servers didn't pay attention to anyone in the restaurant, and there's an older lady who appears to be miserable to work there.   Then, our bill came. I tip generously everywhere I go, so I don't need a restaurant to add an automatic 18% gratuity to my tab. If it was great service, I would understand... but since it's lousy service, why would I tip 18%? That isn't even realistic.   Honestly, reading this over, I should give them one star.

First time eating soul food... my fabulous boss brought me here for a lunch meeting. Needless to say, the "meeting" went out the window and we just chowed down for a good hour. Red beans over rice, mac n cheese, cornbread, catfish... I felt like I was in the movie, Soul Food (can I be Nia Long for a day?)   Five stars based on food only. Service wasn't great... girl at the counter had an attitude problem, or maybe just had a bad day - but no excuses for trying to mess up my experience! Go here anyway!

This is the first gym and staff in all of my years that has actually led me to stay and LOVE what I'm doing for myself. I can't stress that enough. I've tried so many other gyms but quit or felt too much pressure by douchebag personal trainers. As soon as I talked to Will, I felt SO comfortable and was ready to take the plunge. Surprisingly, the membership was extremely affordable. I signed up with a personal trainer, Kaitlyn, and even THAT was affordable. I know, personal training, affordable? Unheard of... but I swear, they broke it up into monthly payments and worked with my financial situation until I was 100% comfortable. No pressure, no gimmicks, no bullsh*t. They greet you by name and treat you like family. I love and would recommend this gym to anyone who wants to lose weight and get healthy!  Side note:  Kaitlyn is absolutely AMAZING if you're looking for a personal trainer. She is honest and sweet... not something you usually expect from a personal trainer, at least in my experience.   This gym is ridiculously clean, too. People say it's a "ghetto area" and maybe it is... but it's immaculate on the inside. 5 stars any day!

Unfortunately, I have to update my review and take back my previous one. The personal training program is a sham... and way too expensive to risk finding out for yourself.   I was with my personal trainer for a month with a strict low-calorie diet and exercising 5x a week (strength training and cardio)... but saw no results. I tried to cancel it, but they had already charged me for two months instead of one (plus the sign up fee and regular gym fees). I spoke to the membership manager who would not refund my money even though my report showed NO weight loss and NO loss of inches.   That's fine - keep your money if that's what makes you feel better, rather than understanding a customer who is not satisfied with your program. Very sad to see gyms still operating on the value of a dollar instead of customer satisfaction.  I went to a different gym (and signed up with a different trainer) - saw results immediately.

Looooove this place! Went here for the first time a few days ago and ordered the lamb kabob pita - addicting. The wait was a little long, which was annoying because I was starving, but when I had that first bite... oh my! Worth every minute of a wait. The tsaziki sauce is served as a side so the sandwich isn't messy. The lamb is cooked exactly the way lamb should be cooked - not too chewy, not burnt, not raw - seasoned, soft and delicious.  My co-worker ordered the Iskandar plate, which she raved about as well. It's located on Mill Avenue but it's tricky to find - you have to park and then walk into a small plaza, then make your way to the back until you see it tucked in the left-hand corner. Go here and enjoy real Mediterranean food!

I've been here a few times already and just now realized I haven't left a review!  Sunday is the best day to come here. Half off sushi and drinks... fabulous all day happy hour. If you're not into sushi (and therefore, you're crazy) just get the rock shrimp bowl... amazing. They also have different flavors of sake (pomegranate is a fav) and sake bombers as well (Sapporo is in large bottles; Kierin is in small bottles).   There's a DJ, and karaoke, and lots of beautiful people. Go here.

Ehhh, I think I used to like this place when I was young and before discovering Scottsdale. There was an event last night with a radio station and a R&B singer - we thought it would be a good idea to check it out... and we were wrong.   The crowd was full of ratchet females and wannabe rappers. The drinks did nothing for my buzz - I think I was drinking pure red bull because there was no taste of vodka. There's a designated dance floor, which is nice, but not when the DJ only plays 2 Chainz.   Maaaaybe I'm spoiled by Scottsdale nightlife, but I would never come back here.

This is the best local sushi spot I've ever been to... and I have been to ALL of them. There is nothing like this place... such a fresh, authentic, flavorful taste to every roll and all of my girlfriends agree. It's such a hidden gem, surprisingly. When we found this place, we didn't know what to expect. After one happy hour session and tons of rolls later, we were ECSTATIC. It's so close to home, too. I love love LOVE this place!

I loooove this place! I'm surprised it has mediocre reviews - I've never had a bad dining experience here. Well, if you decide to go, order the Mediterranean Wrap... all you need to know is that it's made with HUMMUS! You also get a trip to the salad bar (which consists of tons of goodies) when you order the lunch special. The girl at the counter is sweet, too... she helped me with my mess of an order (as usual) and substituted everything I wanted. Repeat customer, most def.

The sushi is absolutely fantastic. Some of the top choices: smoked philly, vegas and baked dynamite. VERY fresh and full of flavor. Sake bombers were ON POINT. Kirin beer bottles are HUGE and the sake is served hot (I can't stand cold sake).  The service, however, made them lose a star. We really didn't know who our server was because not one particular person checked on us. Granted, the place was slammed and I'm sure they were running around like headless chickens... but still. It's not acceptable when the chefs are more attentive than the wait staff.   I'll be returning but I'll sit at the bar next time.

Ahhh, I wish I didn't have to leave a less than fabulous review for this place. I so wanted to love it, buttttt I can't.  Let's start with customer service: It was awful. The hostess seemed annoyed. Our waitress seemed annoyed. No recommendations, no smile, no checking in... to the point where we had to ask her if she was having a bad day because it was so noticeable - to which she replied, "Nope." Lol, oh okay....  Next up, food: I ordered the chicken curry salad. He ordered the mediterranean chicken sandwich. What came out was a chicken salad, and grilled chicken wrapped in bread. We might have went wrong with our choices, but our food was absolutely bland and neither of us finished our plates. The tomato basil soup was awesome, though!  In conclusion, we both realized we are Middle Eastern and have probably been spoiled by Arabic spices and seasonings... and therefore, this place just didn't stand a chance. It is very healthy food, though - so, if you're not Middle Eastern, you might enjoy this place :)

Just like the name says! Very professional group of guys who don't try to swindle you or up-sell their services. They did my oil change, replaced my windshield wipers and took extra precaution with checking my fluids and brakes because I was going out of town. They go the extra mile and deserve great ratings - I started referring them to friends and family immediately.

I just remember coming here when the girls and I were super hungry and ready to go on a carb binge. Eggplant Parm is phenomenal. They have a salad here call the Louie Salad which is a mix of seafood (lobster and shrimp) served over greens and vinaigrette topping. One of the best salads I have ever had. Drinks are served in slightly smaller glasses here, but don't let that fool you... way more alcohol than anticipated, and that creeped up on us after about an hour. Sneeeeeaky bartender!

I feel like I'm one of the many to stop by this place after leaving Best Buy, but thankfully I did because I just loooove this place!   I ordered the chicken shawarma combo (chicken shawarma sandwich, fries and a drink) and out of all the Mediterranean restaurants I've been to - this place definitely serves the largest portion. I mean, HUGE portions of meat and a basket of fries - so because of that, I can understand why their prices are a tad bit more than your usual gyro shop. Side note: they charge you for the sides as well ($.50 each). The food is great and it's unfortunate this place is tucked in a corner behind Best Buy.  The best part of the whole restaurant is the lovely girl who takes your orders. She's not just nice to you... she's nice to EVERYONE who walks in - just a very bubbly, energetic, sweet girl.   All in all, I wish this place was more popular because they deserve it.

Sunday Funday started out fabulously thanks to this amazing restaurant!  We started with an appetizer of chicken nachos... and MY GOD. The "appetizer" was a plate big enough to feed three hungry females and STILL have leftovers.   I'm super picky when I order anything and all of my orders end up being a complicated mess (Can you substitute this? Can I have this on the side? I need dipping sauce.) Our waitress - I'm so bummed I can't remember her name - was the sweetest lady. She was so patient with me and brought out the food exactly how I wanted to see it. Everything was incredibly delicious, too.  Then, to top it all off, apparently they were closing early for their company holiday party. We started noticing people disappearing from the restaurant and we asked the manager if they were closing, to which he replied, "yes, we closed at 2pm." It was 3:30 when we looked at the clock and I couldn't believe it! They let us sit and enjoy our meal without making us feel rushed or even mentioning their early closing time. That was stellar customer service and I would give them 10 stars for that if I could.  Try this place - you will LOVE it.

This place is much too overrated. Unlimited food doesn't really matter when the food isn't great. All of their different selections of meat have little to no flavor... it just tastes like they sprinkle salt and pepper on everything. The salad bar was like any other salad bar... nothing special. The service is great and that's why I'll give them two stars instead of one. I just don't understand what the hype is all about.   A family member of mine was thinking of having her wedding reception here and after sampling the food - she changed her mind. They also said the waiters wouldn't serve the salad in the private room; everyone has to leave the room and serve their own salad... including her, in her big, fluffy wedding dress. Tacky.

I should have walked away from this place as soon as I started the check-in process. The guy at the front desk wasn't helpful... apparently no one was available to assist in carrying bags to the room and there were no baggage carts to help you make one trip to the room.   The room was the size of a bathroom. The walls are paper-thin and you're SOL if staying downstairs because everything creaks upstairs.   You'd be lucky if you receive more than a bar when connecting to wifi.  The only reason I'd give one star is because I forgot a couple personal items in the room and the head of housekeeping, Maria, was prompt in returning my call. She is putting my items to the side until I'm able to go back and pick them up, which is very sweet of her to do.  There are so many nice places to stay in Scottsdale... pick one and spare yourself.

My best friend and I found this place via yelp after a horrendous experience at Mimi's Cafe... so happy we did! Food is great and everyone is so friendly. You can eat out on the patio with shaded tables, or you can eat inside while they play great music (we were dancing to James Brown while ordering our food). It'll be our new breakfast spot from now on!

Last night, I went on a date and was taken to Postino Central. I think I'm going to marry him just for his taste in food and wine :)  To begin, the hostess let us know it would be a 30 minute wait. She took our name down and obviously heard me whining to him about how hungry I was... so she came back about 10 minutes later and seated us. That was incredibly sweet of her and I knew the customer service would be awesome.  So, the waitress tells us the special was bruschetta and a bottle of wine... for $20. I couldn't believe what she was saying. $20... for an entire bottle of wine AND four different selections of bruschetta? Is this real life?   Yes, yes it was... and I was in heaven. We ordered salmon, tomato & mozzarella, artichoke, and white bean (which turned out to be hummus, yay!) and I feel those are the top four in my book. We also ordered the Pinot Grigio and it was a perfect combination. For dessert, he ordered an espresso ice cream and I ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream... both to die for.   Then the bill came, and it was less than $35 altogether. So, I was a cheap date and happy to be so for this place! I can't wait to go back - 10 stars if I could!

$.49 cent per wing on Tuesdays and Thursdays - that's what brought me here when I had a HUGE craving for wings. Well, the place didn't do anything for me. The service was very mediocre. I even made a comment to my girlfriend about how lousy the waitress was. The loaded potato skins were delicious, though. They only brought out one tinyyyyy thing of sour cream, which irritated me. How do you only use one spoon of sour cream for SIX half potatoes? Fat girl annoyances!  I guess that's what you get when your bill only comes out to $8.00. I wouldn't recommend this place at all.

We tried this restaurant for the first time over the weekend and I'm so happy we did. My boyfriend said the carne asada tacos were the best tacos he ever had in his life and I died over everything I ate. The fresh guacamole is to die for and they also bring out complementary salsas that add to the flavor of the entire meal (which I love). We could never find an open table because the place is constantly packed. After trying their food, we definitely know why.

We usually come to Brio for dinner and drinks, and this time we decided to stop in for brunch (and drinks, haha!)... so glad we did!  I ordered Berries & Cream French Toast and he ordered Eggs Oscar... um, well, I ended up eating half of his plate.   The waiter was so friendly and incredibly patient with me, as I could not make up my mind and was ready to order three or four different items. He recommended his favorite and also whipped up fabulous for-the-morning drinks.  I also have to mention valet service, as this is usually a hit or miss for most restaurants. Brio's valet obviously figured it out because they're fast, friendly and go off of tips... with an ATM machine nearby if you don't have cash.  Definitely impressed with brunch selection and dinner was always five stars!

Donutheads... you will never, ever step foot in a Dunkin Donuts (or any other donut shop) once you try the deliciousness that is Bosa Donuts. They're so fresh, so tasty, such a variety and the sweet owner (I'm assuming that's what she is because she's ALWAYS there) will always have a smile on her face no matter how slammed the place is (I've seen the line go all the way outside).  side note: Bosa, in Arabic, means kiss. That's what attracted to me to the place (my cultural roots kicked in and I excitedly thought the owner was Arab). Turns out, they're not Arab and they didn't even know a lick of Arabic, but their donuts are insanely delicious... so me + my entire company = HOOKED.   bosaaaaa, Bosa Donuts! :*

This place is the jackpot of salons... found it through yelp - sooo glad I did! I called Brandon in a panic. I needed a bang trim but had a fear of letting anyone new touch my hair. I also explained how anal and crazy I am when it comes to my hair, which made him think of a genius idea = LET THE OWNER CUT HER HAIR!   Eric (sp?) is amaaaaaaazing! He worked his magic in less than 5 minutes, and I had compliments the entire night on how fabulous my bangs turned out. He also took me in on a last minute appointment the same day I called, which I truly appreciated.   side note: they also serve complimentary wine and snacks while you're waiting :D

You can all disregard my previous review. I absolutely love this place, and apparently my girlfriends are on board as well. All night happy hour, central Phoenix, easy-on-the-eye bartenders... SOLD.   I had mentioned my previous experience to them and how I wanted to give the place a second chance. We love the area and all the surrounding places, so, why not? Best decision. We started off with appetizers (beef sticks, edamame, wings) that were anything but traditional. Every dish had a cultural kick to it, which I loved.   Not surprisingly, we could still go for round two... so, all these plates start coming with jerk chicken, ribs, something called a Kahuna? (steak plate) and all other kinds of jaw-dropping, mouth-watering foods.   So, at this point, I'm completely stuffed and can't breathe. I love food, but Hula's won this round. However! I kept drinking (damn those sour amarettos) and my girlfriends were drunkenly flirting with the bartender... aaaand that's when you know it's time to go.  As the saying goes:  everything deserves a second chance. See you soon, Hula's!

I LOVE THIS PLACE! My cousin and my best friend (see above review) went here tonight and had such a wonderful dining experience!   I think they hooked us right from the start. Our waitress brought out fresh, warm bread with a balsamic vinaigrette and olive oil dipping sauce... oh my! I knew I was going to eat waaayyyyy too much, but I didn't even care! We were trying to pick which pasta we wanted (such a large variety) and everyone was so happy with their selection when the entrees came out (but of course, mine was the best.) Try the Supremo Alfredo with shrimp next time you stop in! We also had a chocolate chunk cookie (with ice cream) for dessert and that was unbelievably delicious.  As much as I love their food, the service was even better. Our waitress, Jessica, was just a ball of sunshine. She was so so soooo sweet and constantly checked on us and made sure we were okay. Craig, our bartender, was just as amazing! He is so funny and such a delight to be around!   I have cravings for Italian food ALL the time, but we always went to different Italian spots... never again! Best service and food I've had in a loooong time! 5 stars any day!

Even though this place might be a bit more pricey than a typical salon, it is worth every extra dollar you pay. I have acne-prone skin, and couldn't get a facial wax without breaking out everywhere the next day (sometimes the same day) until I came to this place.  Go see Paige! She's a doll and is super OCD about making sure every single hair is gone, which I love because I'm the same way. She figured out how to do exactly what my face needed in order to not inflame, and three days after my wax, still no break-out. AND NO MORE FACIAL HAIR! (which is gross to have to begin with - I know; thank my culture for that one.)   Repeat customer foreverrrrrrr!

So a couple girlfriends of mine took me here last night (I know, why were we partying on a Tuesday?) and I fell in love with this place!   Shots are not in shot glasses; they're in 8oz glasses... so, get ready to be more inebriated than you had planned ;)  There were two female bartenders - both were so full of energy and adorable. Katie was our bartender and hands down, best one ever.   It was a Tuesday night, but regardless, the place got packed. I have to check it out on a weekend!

Compared to the other hospitals around the valley, this is definitely your best choice. I gave birth to my daughter here and even though there were a few things that annoyed me, it was a pleasant experience overall (I am definitely talking about the hospital and NOT my labor - God help me forget those 27 hours.)   It started off a bit rocky because the triage nurses do NOT know how to draw blood and I ended up getting poked three times before their supervisor came in and was able to do it in 30 seconds. That honestly made me explode because I'm already in a great deal of pain and if you don't know how to do something as simple as draw blood, you should NOT go near a pregnant woman in labor.   After the paperwork was done, they moved me to a nice room in the maternity ward. I was there for two nights, and had 6 nurses (each nurse switched off at the end of their shift.) Out of the 6 nurses, I had 4 that were absolutely perfect and 2 that I could have done without. Not bad considering the nurse horror stories at hospitals.   The doctor who delivered her was actually part of the hospital (I went into labor on Valentine's Day so my doctor was being whisked away by her hubby.) At first, I freaked out because I had no idea who she was and this was obviously not part of my birth plan, but she was exceptionally professional and sweet. Her name is Dr. Dohn. If you have the chance to request a doctor to deliver your baby (in the event your doctor couldn't make it) you should definitely request her. She is patient, kind and can somehow stay positive after three hours of trying to deliver a baby. God bless her.   Also, can't forget (since this IS yelp) the food is quite tasty for being hospital food!

JACKPOT! This place was referred to me by a co-worker since she knew I needed a couple things done with my jewelry collection. I spoke to the owner on the phone prior to coming in and was impressed with how professional and well-spoken he was (you usually don't get that with jewelers in the valley).   I brought a broken Guess watch (my FAVORITE watch) and all my old gold jewelry... honestly, Arabic gold is expensive and I should probably keep it, but I just don't see myself rockin' 24k gold to dinner or business meetings. It was time to let it go.  They quoted the gold at a price I was so happy with, and kind of shocked too because I didn't think it would be worth THAT much. The owner mentioned the price of gold and how I was lucky because it was a really good time to sell. Like I said, jackpot! They also fixed my watch within the hour and I went home a very happy girl. Highly recommended!

I never thought I'd be posting a review for locksmith services, but Gabriel blew me away with his expertise and customer service. I was in such a mess with my car key - the plastic part was loose, and it kept spinning and spinning without allowing the actual key to start the ignition. So, my brother and I duct taped the plastic part (I know, very ghetto) to keep it from turning... well, that lasted about two hours before I was back in the same situation.   Toyota dealership quoted me the price of a new car (typical) so I decided to yelp cheaper options. He had great reviews and was able to come to my work within the hour. It took him about 5 minutes to figure out the problem (turns out there's a chip and the key needs programming), and 15 minutes before I was presented with a brand new key (for waaaayyyyy less than Toyota quoted me).  Fantastic locksmith - I'd definitely recommend him to all my friends and family.

My brother came home today from work with a fresh haircut (as usual) and it reminded me to leave a review for his barbershop. Not only that, but all his friends go see Alex or Oleg and I'm constantly complimenting them on their hairstyles. My brother and his friends are all Middle Eastern, so they have THICK hair and full grown caveman beards... Alex and Oleg always figure out how to tame it and make it look fresh. It's also conveniently located right near Arrowhead... I always recommend this barbershop to everyone looking for a new barber.

I have to leave a review for this location because of Anthony, the general manager. I had a company meeting and at the last minute, everyone wanted pizza. I called and spoke to him about all the things I can and can't have on the pizza, plus not being able to make up my mind on whether we should have regular soda or diet soda. Anyway, he sat on the phone patiently and took the order... which felt like a full 30 minutes of me debating with myself.  THEN, I call him back frantic because I didn't have cups for the meeting... and he went to the Walgreens next door and picked me up a bag of cups (at no extra charge). I couldn't believe he went above and beyond that way. The pizza got there at the scheduled time I asked for, along with my cups, and everyone loved their pizza.   We'll be ordering from this location a lot now... thank you Anthony!

Loooove this spot! We always come here when we don't feel like driving all the way to Scottsdale for hookah. It's conveniently located in Glendale and close to a lot of popular restaurants. So, after we consume thousands of calories - we stop by and smoke hookah, listen to music and relax. They serve their hookahs out of apple heads (soooo good!) and constantly bring you charcoal.   side note:  I've never had a hookah that didn't last more than two hours. If anybody smokes hookah, you know that is RARE to get.

I really liked this place! The best part is the large patio area... on the weekends, they put the DJ outside and that's where everyone dances. It's perfect for girls who like to dance their asses off because 1.) no sweating and 2.) no frizzy hair!  The bartenders are dope too... free drinks, free shots, LOTS of liquor = I LIKE THAT!  If we ever decide to come back to Mill Ave., which I doubt, we'll definitely come here.

I didn't even make it past the front desk. There is a gatekeeper from hell who is determined to make sure you don't "strut out of there."   First visit: I had an appointment for a full face wax with one free service, and she actually argued with me in front of other women about not receiving the free service. A wax specialist overheard and corrected her, but she did not apologize... she just huffed and puffed and I walked out.   Second visit: Just my luck... gatekeeper is there. My appointment was at 12pm - I walked in at 12:04pm. She wouldn't let me back for a wax because they have a "nine minute late policy." Um, okay, I am only 4 minutes late though... "yeah but by the time you go back there it will be past the late point." I had my newborn daughter with me at the time so I couldn't lose my cool, but I honestly hope she gets fired or someone secretly records how ridiculous she is.   I never went back.

Oh, Stingray... I have such a love/hate relationship with this place.  I *LOVE* their happy hour: Monday through Friday from 3pm - 7pm. Everything is dirt cheap. You could get a couple rolls and sake bombers and edamame for under $15. I love the decor/style of the place - very LA.NY.SanFran'ish.   However, what good is a happy hour and restaurant fashion if the sushi is sub-par and the service is slow? This is where they lost me. The waitresses are pleasant, but it takes forever to get your food, check, water, etc.... and the restaurant won't even be slammed with customers. You can get over that, though. What you won't be able to get over is the taste/flavor of the sushi. It arrives extremely fresh, but it tastes like cardboard. I've tried almost all of them and the only one that is worth ordering is the Philly roll - what does that tell you about the place? The miso soup... I LOVE miso soup. I've never had a bad serving of it until I came here, and asked for them to take it back.   Speaking of miso soup - if you sit by the bar, you'll get a complimentary bowl of it and a plate of edamame.   So, all in all - going to Stingray definitely depends on your sushi standards. If you don't mind lackluster sushi and love cheap happy hour, go here. If you're a sushi snob (like myself) then spare yourself and go anywhere else.

OH MY GOD. How I never found this place until a couple weekends ago baffles me, since I'm always in Scottsdale on Sundays for none other than Sunday Funday... needless to say, Sunday Funday will never again be complete without this snazzy joint.   The cure to a hangover is to drink some more (yessssss) so get your lazy ass outta bed and COME HERE! For $16, you can get ALL the bloody marys and mimosas you want. Yes, you read that right.  Not that I heard anything else from the gorgeous bartender after that $16 deal, but the recommendations for food came out PERFECT. I added a picture of how it turned out (don't mind my still-very-drunk-face) so prepare to droooooooool.   There's also a DJ outside, two floors, lots and lots of beautiful people... and smiley faces everywhere (probably because everyone's trashed). See you Sundayyyyy! :D

I walked into a hidden GEM yesterday when finding this place. They are, hands down, the most fabulous alterations shop in Phoenix (and I've been to plenty). The owner is a sweetheart - let me give everyone the backstory:  My brother is getting engaged next week and the party is on Saturday. In true Arab fashion, I bought my dress at the very last minute - yesterday. I fell IN LOVE with this dress, but the cleavage was insane and I had to fix it... otherwise, my pops would have a heart attack as soon as he saw me. I'm scrambling at 5pm to find an alterations shop that would somehow make this amazing dress work with my figure.  Enter: The Fit. The owner, Dennis, heard the panic in my voice and offered to keep the shop open until I got there (they close at 4pm; it was already 5pm). When I came out of the fitting room, he instantly had a solution to cover up the cleavage without ruining the look or fashion of the dress. Then, I started noticing other things: I wanted the dress to be longer. I wanted my shal to be attached. So, he willingly volunteered to take care of the rest of the corrections just so I could be comfortable and happy with the final result. He also put a rush on the job (I need it by Wednesday) and didn't charge me for it.   Loooong story short, he stayed open until 7pm and dealt with my OCD and every single problem I gave him about the dress. You don't get that kind of customer service too often, and I have to let everyone know about this wonderful little shop.   I will update this post with a picture as soon as I try on the dress. The prices are very affordable; so, you should definitely bring in all the clothes you have that need fixing, and check this place out for yourself.

My husband and I eat ZK quite often - in fact, we just ordered from here last night and it reminded me to leave a review that is long overdue. I wish I could give a rundown of all their entrees and appetizers, but sadly, we both only order the same two items EVERY time (I know, how boring) but we just love how good it tastes! Chicken kabob and lamb combination plate with a mix of rice and salad (and two orders of baklava with a yogurt drink) and MMMMMM we are in heaven! That order comes out to $40, so it's not really cheap but the quality is fantastic AND they serve you A LOT of food (6 pieces of each meat, a big bowl of salad and most likely 2 cups of rice.)   The only thing that irritates us is how they charge for the tzatziki sauce... 75 cents for a small serving. You have to pay for this because they don't serve any sauce with the entree, so it's a minor annoyance but we just suck it up because the food is great.  Also, if you're ordering in, your food is finished very quickly - 15 minutes tops. It doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but when you're hungry and you're rushing home to watch your new favorite show... you seriously appreciate it.

My brother and I came here for lunch a couple weeks ago, and we thought it was great! I'm not a big fan of buffets; but, my brother is and so he usually drags me with him. This is the first one I've been to that actually became a favorite!   Very spacious with comfortable seating. Excellent service from our waiter. I wish I asked for his name.   I never eat the sushi from buffets I go to, but this sushi was surprisingly tasty! All of the seafood was delicious, actually. I was more stuck on the chow mein and the variety of Asian food they served. It was a mix of goodies and we enjoyed all of it.   ... and all of this for only $16! We will most definitely be back!

You know you have to leave one star for an establishment when you get into an argument with a bouncer and the general manager.   "Five dollar cover charge."  *hands debit chard* "Cash only. There's an ATM upstairs." "Uh, nevermind then."  They wouldn't give back my ID, and I honestly lost it. They said something about possession of property and threatened to call the police for theft... because the ID is THEIR property now, and giving it back to me would be considered theft on my part... and they'd have me arrested. I laughed and exploded all at the same time.   So, don't go here. I don't know why I thought Mill Ave. would be a good idea to begin with. Never again.

I never wrote a mean review before but unfortunately, I had to for this particular Olive Garden. My family owns a restaurant and I am exceptionally sympathetic to servers and kitchen staff, but I couldn't even offer that with this restaurant.  I took one of my best friends out to lunch yesterday and had an awful experience while we were there. It took a few minutes for our waitress to come to our table, but that is never a big deal to me. When she came to take our drink orders, we asked for lemon water and a cherry coke. That is a total of two drinks - why did it take longer than 15 minutes to receive?  Then, our food. We ordered an appetizer (stuffed mushrooms) and as common sense goes, appetizers should be the first order to the kitchen so you can munch while waiting for your main entrees. That didn't happen. Our appetizer took over 30 minutes to arrive and for most people, I get irritated when I'm hungry. Still, I was incredibly polite to her because I know what it feels like to be a waitress (even if it's my family's place). I think our server is one of those people who might not care to satisfy friendly customers - they take advantage of kindness and give priority to customers who are screaming and yelling instead.   To not continue this long rant, our entrees didn't show up for another thirty minutes. I asked about the wait two times and she said, verbatim, "yeah I don't really know what's taking so long. I forgot to put the order in but it still shouldn't take this long for lasagna."   That was unprofessional and I asked to speak to a manager at that point, but, surprise surprise! The manager never showed up and we had to wait an additional 15 minutes before we decided to forget about it and leave.   I didn't forget, though. It was supposed to be a nice lunch with a friend and because I didn't get to speak to a manager, I had to put a review on Yelp.

Fabulous place to go to on the weekends! Friday and Saturday nights are perfect... not too crowded, not dead either. Bartenders (only the guys though) are amazing. They take your order fast and fill up your drink with the more than expected liquor of choice. I singled out the male bartenders because the female bartenders are extremely moody and only pay attention to the guys... I would say that's normal but I've been to several lounges and that situation is nowhere near the case.   The DJ plays great music; you'll see people of all age groups dancing to the same songs (Michael Jackson, Rihanna, etc.) and it's hilarious to watch the older crowd try to get down.   The absolute BEST part about Narcisse is the free seating area. I don't think it gets better than that. There are couches, tables, and two outdoor seating areas (outside of VIP) that are for the general public. Besides the W, I don't know of any other place to offer that much seating room for free. 5 stars most definitely!

I went to Gibson's in Chicago and never thought I'd find a steakhouse like that in Scottsdale... until I was introduced to Citizens.   One of my best friends + her boyfriend are steak snobs and only eat steak at this restaurant. It was their birthday celebrations and they, of course, wanted dinner here before the party. The staff was so accommodating. They let me bring cakes for both of their birthdays (see photos) and checked on our group consistently the entire night. The manager is great friends with the couple so he made sure everything and everyone was well taken care of.   The food was extraordinary. I ordered the short ribs the first time and the filet mignon during our second visit. The meat was very tender and full of seasoning (unlike most steakhouses). The short ribs come with this cherry BBQ sauce that is something I've never experienced before - but perfected the meal. Also, I'm kind of hooked on their house drink called The Citizen... but it is one sneaky ass drink! It takes like candy and you feel like you're just drinking juice... then after 15 minutes, you're drunk.  Be mindful of the price of this establishment prior to your arrival. It's worth the amount but it is on the pricey side. If that's not an issue for you... go here and enjoy!

Not exactly the place you would picture a bachelorette party held at... but our little sex kitten (who was losing her freedom that night) wanted the first stop of the party to be at Film Bar, and in walk 20 drunk females ready to watch "The F Word."  Miss Fontane, her flexible dancing crew and rock band put on such a dope show - I forgot I was in a theater. She sang about female body parts while her gymnasts/dancers started doing lap dances on the chair and giving out free ones to the audience. All of us were jealous of their bodies (diet starts tomorrow) and they definitely gave a lot of their attention to our bachelorette. So. Much. Fun.  p.s. they also serve beer, wine AND POPCORN!

What else can I say that hasn't already been said about the lovely Pam? She is FABULOUS! I am a relatively new customer (about 3 months) and I've had fantastic experiences each time. She does the most incredible nail art I've ever seen! I literally text her and say, "Pam, can you do so and so nail art?" and within minutes I get this reply: "Absolutely!" She brings my crazy ideas to life and I receive compliments on my nails DAILY! I would recommend her to anyone who loves gel manicures and especially those nail art junkies like myself!

Looooove this place! We came here for happy hour (drinks are strong, delicious and cheap) and decided to stay for the live music performance (awesome setup but no dancing). I guess you can't have everything you want in a bar but this definitely comes close. We'll be back and hopefully we can dance!

This place is great for a number of reasons, but what I love the most is how quick and easy it is to order the food. Let's paint the picture: it's a Friday night and I don't feel like cooking since  I'd rather play with my super cute daughter... so, I go to their website, order WAY too much sushi, sashimi and of course miso soup. Then, I get a big cheesy smile on my face when I see how cheap my total order is. I receive an email letting me know my order is ready and my husband will stop by on his way home and pick up our dinner. Everything comes packaged neatly (nothing like how take-out usually looks) and of course the food is yummy and I don't have to wash dishes at the end!!

I don't even know where to begin. I am SO lucky to have found Desiree when my daughter was only one month old. She was crying from 8pm - midnight every night for 2 weeks straight and we couldn't figure out what was wrong. She wasn't hungry, her diaper was clean, no gas or illness... so of course, everyone threw out that horrible word, "colic." They also said she would outgrow it by 3 or 4 months old and all I thought was, hell no I'm not going through this for another 3 months! Enter: Desiree. During our first conversation, she told me there was no such thing as colic and that my sweet baby was just TIRED. She came to our house, did an almost 3-hour consultation and was there for us every hour of every day (and night) up until today. It took one week and there were no more tears. Because she was so young, she was still waking up at least once at night (but that is a miracle by any means for a newborn.) She is now almost 3 months old and sleeping ALL night. She is such a happy baby, and we are all on cloud nine. If you're even hesitating to call, DON'T. It is honestly worth every penny if you want your sanity back.

I reallyyyyy like this place! We had a catering order for a colleague's birthday last week, and it was fabulous! Everything came in boxed lunches with labels of each person's name, which everyone thought was great (considering every other food delivery comes in bags or a mess of plates). They have a wide variety of soups, sandwiches and salads - but, what I really loved was how different the selection was from your typical deli/cafe. Example: Thai Peanut Sandwich.. where are you going to find that?!  The customer service was awesome. They were thorough and very fast with their delivery, and even called the next day to check and see how the food was. Everyone liked their food and we all decided we would definitely use them again for our next work lunch. Even if it's not for catering or delivery, you should try this place.

During one of my business trips last week, I decided to try a lesson in time management and actually get to the airport on time. Not only did I succeed, I arrived early enough to grab a bite to eat so I'm not stuck with peanuts. Enter: Sauce.  Not too shabby of a place for being inside an airport, I guess. I'll have to agree with a reviewer below me - the service is "ehh" and they don't care about much more than taking an order. For example, it was my first time and I had a couple questions about the "build your own pizza" and the guy at the cash register was less than thrilled. I ordered a glass of chardonnay and he asked me if I wanted ice... oh God. Why didn't I just turn around at that point?  So I ordered a basic pizza. It had some fancy name to it, but it was just a cheese pizza. Thin crust, minimal sauce (the irony) and not much to be remembered. So I ordered another glass of chardonnay and sucked it up.   Note: The seating arrangement is awful. There are bar stools and tables and you won't find a seat for awhile because the tables seat up to 4 people, and if 1 person took that table - they won't seat you there.   However, it is probably the best you'll get if you need to dine in at the airport - unless you want McDonalds or some crap Mexican food. The prices aren't bad (about $9 for a whole pizza and $5 for chardonnay) along with a variety of other items (pasta, salad, sandwiches, breakfast food). Maybe I just ordered the wrong stuff, but I don't see myself going back for round two.

These guys are lifesavers! This is a review I should have left a long time ago when my father's AC unit just broke down and left everyone in the house frantic. Since I live on the other side of town, I had to find a company that was closer to my dad's house and would come ASAP (it was literally 110 degrees outside.) As soon as I spoke with the owner, he told me not to worry and that he would have one of his technicians over right away. Well, "right away" in customer service world is usually an hour or two, but nope! The owner had someone at my dad's house after 15 minutes!!   Now here comes the shocker... we were 100% positive the AC unit was kaput, and ready to shell out the $5k or whatever it is for a new system. Again, nope! The technician was able to repair a faulty wire and the AC was blasting within the hour. Saved us thousands of dollars!  This company is incredible: great customer service, honest and more than fair prices. 10 stars if I could!

We stopped by for dinner and drinks around 10pm... the owner was kind enough to keep the kitchen open for us and it was such an enjoyable experience from the start.  Our waitress, Stephanie, was such a delight to be around. We kind of figured she had to be related to the owner because she knew the ins and outs of every single item on the menu and described it with such passion!   He went with a ravioli dish with ricotta and spinach and I went with the gnocchi di ricotta, which consisted of eggplants, basil and roasted tomatoes... both to die for. She also recommended these tiny jars which come with a blend of eggplants, mozzarella cheese and tomatoes and served over tuscan toast... MY GOD. It was so good and the chef brought us another round on the house. We topped it off with a delicious dessert of chocolate, peanut butter mousse and vanilla gelato... also complimentary thanks to the chef!  Side note:  They also have THE BEST Moscato I've ever had in my life!   This was a fabulous dining experience (major thanks to Stephanie and the chef) and him and I will definitely be returning!

I really wanted to love this place because of all the hype and how close it is to the Biltmore, but it just didn't do much for me. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and the lady at the register said that was her favorite item. I figured - you can't really go wrong with a chicken salad sandwich, plus her excitement... why not? It was terrible. Lacked flavor. Incredibly dry. I felt like it was canned chicken salad with not much else. I also ordered the chili with cheese and onions.. also, lack of flavor and had a bad aftertaste. The service is amazing - very friendly people, and the layout is nice as well. However, the food is lackluster and it'll end up being an overrated deli.

I love this salon! New management started as of summertime and they have really done such a great job at making this salon much, much better than it used to be. The staff is very polite and they will do what it takes to make sure you're happy with your services. They really do pamper you as much as possible (at one point, I had three lovely employees working on me) and it was so nice to relax and get pretty. They are inexpensive, too. I recommend them to anyone looking for a new nail salon!

I have to leave a review for this pool. You would NEVER in a million years think anything from the Flamingo would be halfway decent... but this pool is crazy legit. The drinks aren't as expensive as other pools (think: Wet Republic) and there's no entry fee. Yet, they still have a DJ and several bars around the pool. There's a really cool waterfall and tons of lounge chairs around the seating area. We fell in love with it, especially after the DJ announced there would be a booty shakin' contest. OH MY GOD. Tons of hot mess females trying to pop and drop in front of everyone at the pool = pure entertainment. Go here!

I'm so surprised no one wrote a review about this place!   Came here over the weekend... it's a new club in Scottsdale and I'm in love with it! Bartenders are full of energy and aren't stingy with your choice of liquor... VIP hosts were incredibly friendly... even the gogo dancers are sexy as hell - no fur boots and tacky outfits at this spot!  Definitely the new go-to-spot in Scottsdale. It gets crazy packed and the music is unreal... the DJ has to be one of the best I've heard. If you prefer quiet and less crowded - definitely have to go somewhere else. But that's boring, so don't!

Unfortunately, I have to update my review to one star.   Since our last experience, we have tried to come back to Epiq on more than one occasion to no avail. They are now charging $20 on Fridays AND Saturdays... even to women.  The last time I talked to the bouncers was the final attempt I'd ever make. It was 12:45am on a Friday night and they refused to drop the cover charge. You want each one of my girlfriends (7 of us total) to pay $20 for only one hour of entertainment? I even asked them to reduce it to $10 and they said no.  So, I vowed not to ever go back and went to Dollhouse instead. The lovely VIP host comped us a bottle and a round of shots... so that's where my 5 stars, my girls and my money are going.

FINALLYYYY! After searching everywhere for a professional esthetician - I found Nadjege!   I called her yesterday for a full body wax appointment; I immediately clicked with her and appreciated her techniques (found on her website.) She is very meticulous (as I am) about body hair and will make sure every last piece of stubborn hair is gone. She uses a super bright lamp to check for missed spots and also switches between soft/hard wax... which served wonderfully at my appointment today. She has an in-home salon and spends a lot of time with you; I never once felt rushed and I was with her for THREE hours!  Side notes: even though she's located in uppity Scottsdale, her prices are ridiculously inexpensive compared to anywhere else. She also gives you great tips on skin care, which helped a lot, and is very hospitable. You don't need to go anywhere else... but don't take my time-slots ;)

Ayyyyy dios mio! I have never been so happy to eat Mexican food. Forget Filibertos and every other 'bertos place... Mariscos is the new spot for hangover food, feel-good food, comfort food or stuff-your-face food.   I had no idea what to order - luckily one of my girlfriends is Mexican, so she brought us some phenomenal dishes. One of them was a bowl of soup with every type of seafood (shrimp, mussels, lobster, clams, etc.) imaginable (mouth-watering). One of them was a mixed plate of chicken/beef/shrimp fajitas with crazy toppings (so freaking tasty). One of them was a chili pepper guacamole shrimp insane mix of a platter (delicious). Then, we had these drinks called Micheladas (spell-check that shit) which consisted of tomato juice and some weird beer. Instant hang-over cure, by the way.  They also have a stage with a live band that plays music while you eat! I haven't seen that since my Rocky Point days!   The service is a tadddd bit slow (we waited for quite awhile to get sour cream) but the waitresses are super sweet, and the food is heavenly, so I really didn't care.   You HAVE to check this place out.

This little shop next to the Shell gas station is a hidden gem! My brother and I were in the car filling up gas and saw a small cafe next door, "Gyros on Central." I loved the name - reminded of how they name restaurants in New York. We were both starving so we thought to try it out.  AMAZING! I ordered the chicken pita combo and he ordered the gyro combo. Both of our sandwiches were filled up with a hearty amount of meat (love that) and the fries were seasoned, crispy and HOT. Too many times I've ordered combos, and the fries end up soggy and/or cold. My brother loved his food, too. The owner came by to ask how everything was and sat with us for awhile - incredibly nice guy. We both appreciated the hospitality.  And we'll both be back  - you should, too!

LOVE this place! We came here for a work lunch and I walked out full, buzzed, and happy.   Order the cornbread. Order the trio. Hell, order anything you want. ALL of it is good.  Crazy note:  There's a margarita called the "Shemango" that is AMAZING. They only allow you to order a maximum of three because of how strong the drink is. I finished the first one and felt like I drank five. SUCCESS!

What a tragedy.  I'm getting married. To all my fellow bride-to-be's, may God not put you through what I just went through with Bella Rose Estate.  Let me start off by saying, this was my dream wedding location. Everything was perfect; I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it.   I called right away and had a lovely one hour discussion with Chad, one of the owners. I explained this would be a unique type of wedding, as we are Middle Eastern and have different customs and traditions in our events. He was very excited to work with me, and I was even more excited by how smooth this was all turning out to be.   We talked cost over the phone. He explained the two different packages - one is an all-inclusive package and one is a DIY package for brides who have to alter certain parts of their wedding due to culture, cost, whatever the reason. You basically rent out the venue, and the rest is yours to play with.   I knew I would most likely have to go with the DIY package due to our differences in culture (cuisine, decor, entertainment, etc.) and this didn't seem to be a problem. I explained the wedding would be 300+ and he mentioned the max capacity would be 300 guests, for $xyz. Perfect, I thought. I made an appointment to see the venue the very same day.  I arrived and he was there to greet me, and showed me a grand tour of the establishment. I was even more in love. My heart was set - this is where I'm going to get married. After viewing everything, we sat down to discuss the terms.   After bringing the cost sheet and other material, I saw the same price he had given me earlier for a guest count of 150 guests. Curious, I asked him how it can be the same price for 150 and 300... to which he explained, "no, for each additional guest above 150, there is a charge of $x per person." Calmly (but panicking on the inside), and without accusing him of misleading me, I asked if the $x per person can be waived. He said he would go inside and discuss with his wife, and would be back shortly. Mind you, the cost difference was HUGE.  It all went downhill from there.  After discussing with his wife, they would not waive the $x fee per person. So, I had to remind him that the cost he gave me over the phone is the cost he is showing me for 150 people... even though he was giving me that same cost for 300 people. In what seemed like a horribly scripted part of a movie... he replied, "I know. I forgot about the extra charge."   At that point, I found myself pleading with him. I told him I was 1.)in love with the venue, 2.) drove an hour to meet with him, 3.) had my heart set on this place, 4.) told that 300 people would be $x cost, and 5.) this was not good business ethics. If you tell a bride a price - that's the price you stick to. No excuses... especially not, "I forgot."   Even though he was in the wrong for misleading me and giving me false information, he would not correct it. They dismissed me without any apology and I left heartbroken.   I would never, ever recommend this place to anyone. Some people might say... well, just pay the difference if you really love it. But, it's a matter of principle. If you tell a bride-to-be a certain price for the number of guests at her wedding, you can't come back and say "I forgot to tell you..." without correcting YOUR mistake.   I'm back on the hunt for another venue and I honestly wish I never saw this place to begin with.

I never thought I'd be leaving a review for carpet cleaning services, but my goodness this company definitely deserves a 5 star review.   My wedding is coming up in 34 days (yes, we definitely have an internal countdown going) and my house needed a really good spring cleaning before all my guests arrive from out of town. I called a few companies and of course, hearing the neediness in my voice, tried to overcharge me. Mike from Arizona Steamers was the only guy that gave me a really great (and fair) price for the work that needed to be done. I guess myself and probably a million other people would assume that lower prices = lower quality... but amazingly that was NOT the case with this company!   My carpets look BRAND NEW! It's not an exaggeration or happiness spewing from my keyboard... no - every spot, stain, weird color... EVERYTHING is gone! I look like I had the carpets replaced and didn't pay for a fraction of what that would have cost.   So, in summary, anyone who needs spring cleaning and doesn't want to deal with shady carpet cleaners... make sure you call these guys!
