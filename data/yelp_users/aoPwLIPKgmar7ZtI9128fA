Disappointed. This wasn't our first time but it will be our last. First, my wife's wine glass had some suck-on food from its previous owner. Then her rigatoni with chicken in pink vodka sauce had bad chicken. She described it as chicken that had been in the refrigerator too long. My food was good. I had the lobster ravioli special.  Our server replaced my wife's glass and promptly ordered a rigatoni without chicken. A manager never visited our table and that ruined the place for us. I understand that mistakes happen. But for the manager to not address the problem or even take the add-on chicken off the bill is unacceptable.

Awesome visit. It was my first time by my wife's second. We already had dinner elsewhere but she insisted we crossed town for their dessert.   We were seated promptly on the patio. It was pretty busy in the dining room. Our mission was to have the chocolate bars of sin.  Even though we were there just for dessert, our sever was excellent and very attentive. We paired the dessert with some Riesling. OMG - wow, loved the dessert and the music coming from the band playing in the open area a short walk away. Total bill was about $16.  I can't wait to come back and try their entrees.

Cafepino saved my long overdue date night. After a bad experience at another restaurant in town, we thought we would try Cafepino for dessert. We were so impressed by the food, the waitstaff, and someone who I assumed to be a manager/owner.   We ordered the chocolate hazelnut gelato special and a strawberry tart. Both were fabulous!!!!  We will definitely be back for another date night.

Great time for dinner with friends. 4 of the 6 of us ate sushi. Everything tasted fresh and it was presented well. The server didn't hear my wife order her entree and thought she just wanted a dinner salad. But he made it right. We'll be back.

Awesome lunch today with my wife. She had the brisket sandwich and I had the Memphis Flyer pulled pork sandwich. We will be back.
