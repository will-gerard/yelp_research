Great spot to grab breakfast or lunch in the Arcadia neighborhood.  Recommend trying the Cubano sandwich (not listed on the menu) and the bacon potato salad in the single serving deli area.

One of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch for around 10 bucks.  Their #3 with cooked noodles, vegetables, pork and egg roll is very tasty with the additions of some chili and hoisin sauce.  Highly recommended.

Great spot tucked away in a strip mall off of Scottsdale Rd and Shea.  Have been here 3 times to look for and find nice posters of various skylines.  The posters were matted nicely and ready for pickup within a week.  All 3 times the customer service has been great and I'll continue to support this small business.

Unfortunately the quality appears to have gone down over the last couple months.  The last two times I have been I've had a breakfast sandwich where the sausage was dry, eggs overcooked and the second time the bagel was moldy.  Hope they correct some of these things in the future.

Great spot that I usually visit when I'm in the area.  I like the fact they use Boars Head deli meats and I'll add that to a toasted sesame bagel with cream cheese for a few extra dollars.   Staff is friendly and food is consistently solid!

Had the flat iron steak with basmati rice and vegetables - the meal was good, but nothing memorable - might try their filet with mashed potatoes next time.  Very nice atmosphere and plenty of room at the bar which was nice.

Out of all the AJs locations around Phoenix/Scottsdale, I think this one is probably my favorite. Their carving/entree station is very good and the staff is friendly.  I also like the layout of the store.  If you get their early on the weekends, check out the hot breakfast items they have.

Came here after reading some of the reviews and unfortunately was disappointed.  Ordered the delux sliders, half order of fries, and a vanilla shake.  Best part of the meal was the fries.  The texture of the burger was off - tasted almost rubbery and had vey little seasoning.  The shake too watery and didn't have much flavor.  Would rather get this combo at In N Out and save 10 dollars.

Used to enjoy this place, but the last 3 breakfast experiences have unfortunately been subpar.  From a food standpoint, during 2 of my visits I ordered some fried eggs over medium with the yolk runny - both times the eggs were cooked over hard.  The other time I ordered an omelet and the eggs were overcooked and the potatoes were over salted.   Service was also mediocre as on 2 occasions as I wasn't greeted at the register and the employees seemed to be in a bad mood - was a little awkward.  Hopefully there are positive changes that happen soon as this restaurant has a great landscape - probably won't return any time soon as there are several other places that consistently deliver on both food and service for around the same price point.

Great experience at this steakhouse.  I had a caesar salad and the bone in rib eye and we shared the potato gratin with the group.  The steak was cooked perfectly to medium rare and the staff was attentive to our beverages.  Highly recommend.

Started coming here as I had previously had inconsistent services from two other dry cleaning establishments.   Great service, quality and do a nice job with the heavy starch.  Usually they have my shirts and slacks ready within 2 days.

Received a groupon for this place as a gift.  Was excited to check it out with a couple friends.  Great service, however, the beer didn't taste very good in our opinion.  We ordered a couple flights of beer and were able to try most of what they had on tap - some of them we didn't even finish.  Maybe it was just some bad batches of beer.  Probably won't return to this spot although the servers are very nice and attentive.

Was recently here for the 3rd time and I'm a fan of this place - keeps getting better each time!  Our group ordered the Brie, Cracker and Fruit platter and the Saturday special - Chicken Pot Pie to share.  The Pot Pie had a flaky crust and the filling was perfect - would certainly order it again.  Also, between the hours of 3-6pm, they have several bottles of wine for $20 during HH - great deal as most of these bottles retail for about $15 at the grocery store.  Looking forward to returning in the future and will probably try one of their steaks.

Used to own a Hyundai and would periodically get the car serviced at this location over the last two years.  From my experiences, most of the staff members are friendly and helpful.  However, a couple folks have been lacking on customer service.  Also, when I've used the shuttle service it appears unorganized and I've experienced long waits several times.  I've traded in my Hyundai for a different brand of car and have had very good experiences with their service department.  Maybe I caught this Hyundai service department on some bad days or perhaps there is opportunity for improvement.

Visited here as I had read about their burgers receiving national accolades.  Solid atmosphere and good service from the bartender.  Decided on ordering a standard cheeseburger with the usual fixings and requested it cooked medium.  The burger unfortunately was cooked well done with very little flavor/seasoning.  Wouldn't return for the food, but might stop by again for a draft beer during HH as it was 50% off.

Solid spot to check out to cure the occasional burger and french fry craving.  Recommend the trying the turkey burger (I usually hold the mayo and sprouts) - very flavorful and cooked perfectly.

Came here for the first time with some friends who had visited several times before.  I let them guide me with the brunch selections and all were fantastic - croissant to start, quiche Lorraine and salad for the main dish, and Crepes with Nutella for dessert.  Had to take a long nap afterwards, but worth it.  Will come back soon.

Cool spot in Phoenix for brunch and beverages.  Had the crab Benedict which was really good and I would order it again.  Also, got an order of the small donuts with jam for the group and they were eaten in no time. Would return here again and probably try some lunch/dinner options as I've heard those are good.

Really good place to get breakfast in Central Scottsdale.   Their salmon/cream cheese scramble is delicious as well as their eggs/bacon/hashbrowns/pancake breakfast.  Both are around the 9-10 dollar range.  Recommend trying their fresh squeezed OJ.  Would have been a five star review, but downgraded a bit since I've two times I've been there the hash browns have been lukewarm.

Had heard great things about this place and with the temperatures around 110 degrees, decided to cool off with strawberry ice cream in a waffle cone.  Really friendly staff and super quick with the order.  Ice cream was very good and they have a nice outdoor seating area with lots of shade and good music.

Pretty solid fast food burger place.  Their burgers and fries are on par with In N Out - only recommendation would be to cut down on the amount of lettuce as it accounts for about half the sandwich.  Service is generally good, but have had a few incorrect orders and some cashiers that have been less than friendly.

Was in the market for about 6 cards for a variety of special occasions recently.  Was able to find all 6 cards within about 15 minutes with the assistance of the staff.  You can also sign up for a membership (free when I when I made my purchase) and I received a free card that day - you'll also get promotional emails as well.  Will be returning here in the future.

Seems to be a popular place, but I'm not a big fan. Have been here several times with large groups.  Food has always seemed like it has sat out for awhile and not fresh. Great beer selection though so it's a good spot to grab a cold beverage.

Matthew is a great barber and i've been going to him for over 6 months.  Depending on when you swing by, there may be a couple folks waiting in line, but it's worth it.  Consistent cuts and an enjoyable experience every time.

Great place to get your car washed if you're in the Northern part of Scottsdale.  Reasonably priced and the quality has always been great.  Usually my car is in and out within 30 minutes (enough time to finish a coffee).  Might try their car detailing services in the near future before the hot weather sets in.

Flew on Allegiant for the first time during the holiday season this year as the destination airport was closer to my parents place than Sea Tac.  Flight arrived on time, however, the seats were very uncomfortable with not a lot of leg room.  Ticket price once additional fees were calculated ended up about the same as major airlines.  Probably won't be using this airline in the future.

Came here as I had read an article about this place and the reviews were good.  I went with the smoked chicken wings just to get an idea of the flavors and seasonings they use.  On the positive side, the food was hot out of the smoker and the skin was crisp.  However, there was way too much seasoning and salt flavor - the salt penetrated all the way to the bone of the chicken wing it was so intense.  The wings came with ranch dressing which was very basic.  The BBQ sauces were tasty and I mixed the spicy pineapple one with their sweet/smoky sauce.  The rating is more like a 2.5, but I'll go with a 2 as I won't be visiting this place anytime soon as there are several other great BBQ options.

Spent about 3 hours here having various bourbon drinks and a rack of ribs with a friend.  Staff was very pleasant and quick with service.  I liked the fact they served flights of whiskey - for $16 you get 4 different whiskeys from a specific price range.  They even have 2 bottles of Pappy Van Winkle which is pretty tough to find and the glass will cost you $70 or $110 depending on the year - will keep in the mind for a special occasion!

This is one of the best places to grab a burger and fries in the Phoenix / Scottsdale area.  I get my burger with cheese, onions and tomatoes - each ingredient is fresh and compliments the two beef patties perfectly.  I also get a side of fries and a lemonade - about the same price point as some other burger chains and much tastier IMHO.   Highly recommended.

This is a really good brewery with tasty food.  Didn't have any beers this time, but will in the future.  The southwest chicken club sandwich with duck fat fries is really good - it is a tad spicy so be prepared.  Looking forward to trying others things when I return.  Staff was very friendly and attentive.  Might be the best brewery I've been to in Arizona.

If I could this place 6 stars, I would.  Came here with friends before a party and had a great time.  Great wine selection and the grilled cheese sandwiches were on point.  Bartenders are awesome, majority of the music is from the mid 90s, and the crowd is down to have a good time.  Was so good that we returned back after the party.  Will return again soon!

Have been here several times over the past couple months.  Great atmosphere and furniture although it would be nice if the bar area was a little larger.  All of the drinks and cocktails are very good - recommend the Old Fashioned and Gin Fizz.  The brussels sprouts and mushroom flatbread are tasty shareable items for small groups.

I frequent Starbucks on a regular basis and usually have 2-3 locations in my rotation - usually solid service and an enjoyable visit.  I stopped by this location recently for the first time and unfortunately had a very bad experience.    The layout of this Starbucks is visually appealing, but the employee who was having a side conversation with another employee and using strong profanity was embarrassing and unprofessional. It was so loud that other customers could hear throughout the building and started to leave.  I left shortly after this experience and will not be returning to this location.

Solid 4 stars.  Came here based on a recommendation for brunch. The architecture is really cool and the service was spot on.  Decided to order the steak, eggs, and hash browns.  Everything was good, but it didn't quite reach the great category - had asked for eggs over easy and they came out over medium, steak was warm when served and not cooked evenly throughout, hash brown patty had good texture but not a lot of seasoning.  Would certainly come back again and try some of their other brunch items.

Have been here 3 times since they have opened and it's gotten better each time - solid beers all around and good pub food. Servers are great and I recommend the Irish ale if you're thirsty and the soft pretzels and cumin spiced chicken wings for snacks.  Bonus points for it being walking distance from my residence.

Found this place via Yelp as I was looking for some good authentic mexican food in Scottsdale area.  Was pleasantly surprise with this place - tucked away in a small strip mall, the place is clean and the owner is very friendly. Lots of options on the menu - I opted for the steak fajitas with flour tortillas.  The steak was very tender with just the right amount of seasoning.  Perfect sized portions and the guacomole had a nice spice to it.  I will certainly be returning and recommend that you check this place out!

Stopped by for a quick drink.  They have a great liquor and cocktail selection.  I opted for a glass of Blanton's served neat.  The food menu looked pretty solid and entrees were reasonably priced in the $20 range.  I could see this place filling up on the weekends.  Looking forward to coming back and trying some of their food and one of their inventive cocktails.

Had a burger here for the first time last weekend and it was great.  Ordered the double cheeseburger without sauce - tasted fresh, loved the potato bun, and seasoned well.  Will cost a few bucks more than In N Out or Five Guys, but better than both in my opinion.  Thy also have alcohol options which is a plus.
