Ended up here last week looking for a quick place to have lunch with a friend.  we thought they weren't open but someone came out and waved us in.  trying to catch a movie in an hour we decided to try them out.  we were first disappointed to find out that they don't have chicago style thin crust.  "They have flatbread"  but this was remiss.  let me preface by stating I spent the first 18 years of my life growing up in Northern Illinois and I'd like to think I know a thing or two about chicago pizza, generally you have your more popular Chicago style deep with the stuffed topping and a layer of sauce on top, then the lesser known "but still delicious" Chicago style thin, which is thicker than NY style usually square cut with lots of cheese and some of the toppings under the cheese, usually with sweeter sauce.  well Uno doesn't have this, they have flatbread, but I'm sorry I thought I was going into an "AUTHENTIC CHICAGO STYLE PIZZA" place for a chicago style pizza.  After we gave up the dream of thin crust we ordered a deep dish with a few meats. a while later (remember it's deep dish) we got our pizza and although it wasn't bad it wasn't anything special and I think they should maybe tone it down on the "CHICAGO THIS, and CHICAGO that, keep your windy city to yourself, cuz I'm not fooled"  I give them credit for getting the pizza out in a reasonable time frame, but paying $25 for a pizza that was "alright" didn't leave me in a good mood.  But you can be kind of a dick about pizza when you grew up eating what you believe is some of the best pizza in the world.

After spending almost 3 hours at this restaurant on NYE and our party having to reschedule some of the nights events.  I was somewhat reluctant to go back to cheuvront so soon when some of our friends asked us to go with them after the OYE at the Heard Museum. regardless we went for appetizers and cocktails, with a party of at least 10 we were able to get in and out in about an hour and a half. My Wife and I shared some of the pork empanada's which were actually very good, and I had a Pizza Blanc with scallops and shrimp, and for the first seafood pizza I've ever had I was quite impressed.

I really want to give the George & Dragon 5 stars, between the last time we were there and our server was awesome.  The Awesome Local Pub/ Football Hooligan bar atmosphere they provide, and the Owners and the the british expat company they keep who are characters in and of themselves.  the G&D is truly an experience.  Unfortunately on our last visit our waitress seemed to have horse blinders on, on several occasions we waved, we raised our hands, we yelled at her back and somehow she just didn't make eye contact or acknowledge that we were trying to get her attention.  despite somewhat unresponsive service we were still able to get drinks regularly enough throughout the night..  I also tried the food for the first time, it felt fitting to order the fish and chips, the chips are just steak fries with no memorable qualities,  however the fish was I believe cod, but the batter was very tasty and crispy, it was served with a side of coleslaw that wasn't bad either.  overall the atmosphere in this place is awesome, and the british expats that hang around the bar make it that much more convincing.  I'm confident that the incident we had with service was just that "an incident" and it's possible the waitress was just spread thin or stressed.  I'm confident our next visit will be fine, because I enjoy going to this bar.

We decided to do a very belated make up anniversary, which was originally going to be at coup des tartes.  So I figured better late than never, this was my 2nd time and probably a few more for my wife at coup des tartes.    the Staff greeted us prompty and seated us right away.  I can never get over how small this place is.  it's like...  Let me show you to your table... 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi... and here we are  although they do seem to make the most of the space and it's not really an issue.  I love that this restaurant is BYOB, I ambitiously brought 2 bottles, we barely made it through the first.  We were a little disappointed to see that they'd taken the Filet Mignon Taco's app off of the menu.  instead I had a salad and my wife had soup which weren't bad.  For Dinner I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, it was cooked perfectly served over a bed of sea beans in a coconut glaze.  it made a perfect subtle combination and I could eat that coconut glaze on anything.  My wife had Cordon Bleu which she allowed me to taste and from the bite I had it was very enjoyable as well.  For Dessert we had a four berry tarte, the tarte was very good with home made ice cream and fresh berry, served with a side of I believe Creme Fraiche.  All in all it was a good meal, and not a bad date night, and I will be back.

My Wife and I found ourselves in central phx one evening and she suggested this place.  We stopped in and the entire restaurant was adorned in texas/western themed memorbillia.  It was definitely tacky but not without it's appeal.  Places like this tend to tout their "Chicken Fried Steak" Uber Alles  And If I remember correctly the menu claimed "world famous, or something of that degree" chicken fried steak  So what was I to do?  Well I ordered that there "Chicken Fried Steak" that's what.  I made the mistake of Ordering my salad with "Mustard Vinaiarette" the choices were that and "Ranch" I'm convinced they keep a cup of it around to "prevent profiling" I don't have anything against ranch, I don't hate america, I just prefer other dressings.  Our food came promptly, and the CFS was HUGE!!!!! (emphasis on HUGE) with a big mountain of mashed potatoes  The Meat was nice and tender and the breading was crispy but airy, I might have finished 40% of my meal at best. overall the food was actually quite good.  At one point the manager came by and checked on us,which is something I always like.  It's definitely the kind of place you'd expect to hear a record skip if you walk in the door impromperly attired, but it has a certain local flare and appeal that would bring me back in.

Pruitt's is one of those kind of places where you can tell it started off as a family owned business in a single shopspace, that did well for itself and eventually owned the whole plaza.  between my Wife and I and our inlaw's we've gotten several pieces from Pruitt's and have been generally happy with our purchases.  The store itself is huge and you can walk from gallery to gallery for what seems like forever, it seems like the building has been there forever, monochrome computers and disused neon signs and mis-matched what used to be exterior walls show what this place must have looked like in it's hay day.  all the salesmen are old fashioned and very courteous, we haven't ran into an overly pushy salesmen yet, and many of them seem like they have been there for a long time.  with our most recent purchase our salesman Marty was very helpful and gave us his card and told us to call him if we had any problems.  the quality of the furniture is good and the prices range depending on which gallery you look in, we can usually find something nice in our price range here, where the same or similar piece may cost significantly more at a chain retailer.

I've been to their other location at 1219 E Glendale Ave, and the bell location is a lot less tucked away and has a nice patio too if you enjoy outdoor eating. The pizza is consistent with their Glendale Ave location. and if you've never had their pizza before I highly recommend  it  I could go on and on about growing up in Illinois and eating all the authentic Chicago pizza's. but I won't , because if there's one thing AZ is full of it's transplants bashing the local fare and raving about the food at home.  keep in mind they serve chicago style thin, which is a change of pace compared to the classic chicago style deep with the layer of sauce on top and the toppings stuffed in the middle. Typically with chicago style thin, some of the toppings will be under the cheese and it's generally a sweeter marinara than most are used to.  If you're not in the mood for pizza I can also recommend the spaghetti calzone which my wife will order from time to time, I recommend ordering this with meatballs.  but personally I'm a sucker for the pizza, also the prices are pretty reasonable and expect to have leftovers unless you've got a real A-game appetite  If you don't know the story behind Spinato's originally it was under the name Aurelio's which if you've ever been in the chicagoland area is a local family owned favorite throughout the state. and my personal favorite, and one of my "we have to eat here" places when I go home to visit.  Aurelios started out in AZ by a relative of the Aurelio family and eventually the family owned franchised took off the aurelios name, but continued to deliver the same high quality pizza under their own name Spinato. the pizza is not verbatim to Aurelios in IL, but it's damn close, damn tasty and good enough to inspire childhood nostalgia and a drive from surprise to 16th st and Bell.  I'm almost a little sad that I didn't discover Spinato's up until last year. My wife has in the past even looked into getting mail order frozen pizza from Aurelios dry ice and absorbinent fees and all. and the closest thing I could find was deno's which was made in  the same style but the flavors were different.  fortunately they like to order this pizza at work and one day I tasted some pizza and was immediately reminded, I looked at the box did some googling and was amazed that they were here all along.  I hope to frequent Spinato's and hope they setup a location further west.

Well I finally made it down to caswell's last saturday to use my new membership my father in law got me. I didn't have a reservation but they were still able to accomodate both of us by giving us both our own shooting lane.  The Staff seems really personable like they know their customers and their needs.  I ended up renting a HK (Heckler & Koch) USP Compact 9MM, I put 150 rds though it with no malfunctions, great gun unfortunately I don't have $800.00 to spend on a handgun.  Nonetheless had a great time, got to shoot my Father in Law's GSG5 .22 MP5 clone too.  The range itself is nicer, they actually have keypads where you enter in the desired range for your target.  Also the rangemaster was watchful but unintrusive to those that we're handling their guns safely.  My only minor complaint was that it being an air conditioned range they had the A/C on and it was a cold day to begin with so it was very cold and found myself wearing my jacket most of the time, which is no big deal.  But with rentals you only get 1 magazine, so it's not fun to begin with to force 13 hard little pieces of brass into a magazine every time you run empty, let alone when you're hands are aching from the cold.  Rather than complaining I decided to be a man about it and said it could be worse.  overall it was still a great range visit.  After shooting I was looking around the store and handled a few handguns, a few sigs, a Springfield XD9, and a Walther P99, I asked about an inexpensive but reliable 9mm.  And was pointed to the CZ (Ceska zbrojovka) line of handguns.  Apparently it's a Czech company but it's really popular with competition shooters and are known for being some of the most reliable and accurate guns out there and has actually been considered as a standard  government issue sidearm, unfortunately due to political reasons (favoritism towards germany) it was not chosen. after holding and feeling out the CZ-75B I was sold, and being a new member I got great discount too. Can't wait to clean it out and put some rounds through it.  Hoping to go back soon to put some more rounds downrange and maybe pickup some accessories.  Also planning on taking CCW here at some point.  Maybe one day I'll review a restaurant again.

My Wife's family invited us out to dinner here a few weeks ago, the exterior looks like an old frontier town and inside there's a gift shop and the entire restaurant has ties hanging from the ceiling with business cards on the walls, apparently, if you wear a tie here they cut it off and hang it from the ceiling. Needless to say the amount of people wearing t-shirts with windsor knotted ties was astounding, the attraction definitely seems to be in the novelty, They also had a country crooner type singer that was way too loud and got annoying quickly.    The food was OK at best, I ordered a steak and chicken combo, with a baked potato, the chicken was a 1/4 chicken so if you're squeemish about bones, avoid this.  The Steak was somewhat devoid of flavor so I ended up dishonoring it with A1.  They also serve cowboy beans family style to the table, They are also surprise, surprise "Devoid of flavor".  the table ended up splitting some apple pie/ice cream desserts, which were actually pretty good.  if you're looking for an "Authentic cowboy" meal, well this might be the place, just don't be surprised when you find out what authentic tastes like.

I'm not sure what the deal is with Black Angus, the setting almost tries to present a higher class eating experience, although that fleeting ambience in their eyes justifies their prices.  We went last night, and I've been several times before because this tends to be a go to of the in-law's.   (and because they were paying :)   I've never been overly impressed by their food, and even prefer the kischy outback and lone star to them.  The meat tends to be bland and not better than I can get at an $13.95 special steakhouse. the difference is the same smaller cut of meat costs 21.99 at black angus.  The appetizers aren't bad but nothing I haven't seen some derivation of before.  the service wasn't bad, but nothing else really stood out to me, except the high prices.  if they want to treat me to a steak dinner, who am I to refuse, but you won't see me there of my own accord.

This is without a doubt my Favorite pizza place in the Surprise area, they serve Chicago Style thin crust pizza reminiscent to the pizza of my youth growing up in the suburbs south of Chicago, I've had pizza from the "THE BEST" Chicago pizzeria's in my life and I can safely say this pizza is an accurate representation of that region.  The pizza is loaded with cheese and in typical chicago fashion some of the toppings are under the cheese and some are on top. prices are affordable and in many cases cheaper than the generic triad (pizza hut,dominos, papa johns) this is also a BYOB establishment so we like to show up with a bottle of wine or two. though I've seen families bring in entire coolers, I also recently heard they started offering delivery but the last time we went we dined in and have yet to try this service.  My "best in class" top pick for pizza in surprise.

Ended up here with the in-law's after an unsuccessful attempt to procure a vacuum from the JC Penney home store.  The last time I was here I ordred a macadamia crusted tilapia that was adequate but the portion was severly lacking.  This time I decided to play it safe and ordered a teriyaki chicken and rice dish.  I'm really not sure what this has to do with elephants or africa but it seems that most places with oversized menu's tend to offer something of this variety.  the menu said crispy teriyaki chicken, the chicken wasn't crispy but it was well cooked and the sauce wasn't bad.  all in all the meal wasn't bad. but nothing memorable.

We stopped by the original hamburger works for lunch today. I had never been but my wife has before and I remember her saying that she was glad to see a local mom and pop establishment like this was still open there and thriving after not eating there in years. When you walk in you're greeted by wood walls, vintage signs some that even light up, this is the kind of place that influenced the cookie cutter "crap on the walls" restaurant décor.  I ordered the "classic" which is the cheese of your choice with mushrooms and bacon.  We also ordered an order of chili fries to share. The burger is served on a no frills styrfoam plate., because that's what it is, an honest to goodness no bull$&amp;@t tasty burger. And it was just that a big carb riddled well made slice of heaven.  The chili fries we're also very  good, I could see myself just eating a bowl of the chili, they we're literally swimming in chili and cheese.  All in all it was a very solid choice for lunch, and I look forward to going back and trying other menu items.

My Wife and I stopped here last night after doing some shopping downtown, We've been coming here for years, and she and her family have been coming there since she was a little girl, it's a little bit off of the beaten path, but worth a stop, it's doesn't look like much from the outside and the building is kind of old, but these kind of family owned businesses are hard to come by, most of the dinners  range from $8-10, I'm a big fan of the country fried steak, the -portion is good size, the gravy is the right thickness, the meat isn't too gristly or fatty, their mash potatoes seem to be homemade and fresh, and the corn on the cob I had was sweet and juicy. their bread is to die for, and all dinners come with a salad bar which is surprisingly well stocked.  definitely a favorite when in search of comfort food, we can usually get a table with little or no wait, and the service is always attentive.

My Only regret about RSSC is that it's on the opposite end of the earth from me.  Myself and Chris H had a Man-Date here this weekend, this was the first time I've been to RSSC and I must say it's definitely got a lot to offer.  We arrived in the middle of their Day around 2PM and despite the range being full we were still both immediately able to get our own shooting benches. targets are dirt cheap compared to some ranges and the best part is a non-member can shoot there all day for a mere 7 dollars.  Whereas most of the indoor pistol ranges cost 15.00 just for an hour.  They provide, benches stools, benchrests, sandbags, most of what you need, minus the actual firearms and ammo.  We stayed around 3 hours and shot a variety of different guns of different calibers going all the way from .22LR up to .303 british, at ranges going all the way from 25 yards out to 100+ yards.  the rangemasters were aware but not breathing down our necks, they corrected shooters making safety mistakes, however more or less left us alone aside from the occasional glance since we both seem to be pretty safe around our guns.  it's quite a trek, but this might have to be a monthly thing.

I ended up meeting a friend on the east side of town for dinner a few nights ago.  Since my wife isn't a huge fan of seafood we tend to go to all the places my wife doesn't like when we catch up.  My friend suggested sullivans pier, we used to go there years ago for fish and chips.  The restaurant seems to have moved or opened a new location on Southern Ave.  Nothing much for decor, seems to be a former burger king.  We were both drawn in by the coconut platter.  1 side, 2 HUGE coconut shrimp, and 2 big pieces of coconut whitefish for around $8. we also shared some friend mushrooms.  The shrimp were fairly fresh and tasty, the tropical sauce they server with the paltter is very good.  the fish were crispy and satisfying, and I tend to be a bit of a purist with fish and chips usually just Malt vinegar, and a lemon wedge, occasionally tartar sauce. The last time we had seafood together we went to Red Lobster and were underwhelmed with about the same amount of food except it cost around $60 for two.  I only wish I had something like this on the westside of town.

I found myself in Tempe this Saturday with a friend, it was late afternoon and we were both really hungry, we were looking for a Chinese buffet / stir fry restaurant. I knew of a few but the few from years ago when I lived down here, unfortunately they were all closed.  We saw mr Hunan out of the corner of our eyes and decided to give it a try.  The staff was nice I ordered the Hunan chicken which was ok at best, I thought it would be better assuming it was their signature dish. Sadly I think even pei Wei has more flavor.   The other thing that rubbed me the wrong way was their fountain soda machine was broken.  This kind of thing could cause a lot of customers not to come back especially when given the number of choices in the area.   I say Mr Hu-nah... thanks

I've been coming to Monti's off and on for years with my Wife and her family.  I'm surprised more people don't know about Monti's the service is always friendly, the food is good, and it's right across from the old Mill.  I've had numerous other dishes, but just last night I had the Full Monti burger, which doesn't disappoint.  1/2 lb burger, Big Crispy Onion rings, rich BBQ sauce, Cheddar and Pepperjack cheese, with Bacon.  This is literally the Michael Jordan of Western Cheeseburgers.  Even the Potato Skins we had seem to have received so much more love than offerings we've had at other places.  The Service was great, I couldn't get to the bottom of my glass and our waiter was very friendly and helpful.  A great choice when you're looking for a steak, or just a burger.

Oh Deli, you never seem to disappoint, last night you had 6.75 draft pitchers that were ice cold as well as the mention of $1 draft specials and $2 vodka u-call-it's, we never seem to leave with our pocketbooks hurting.  This place is the mecca of people watching, like characters from a steinbeck novel all sorts elbow up to the bar and settle in for a while, looking for something.  on fridays they have a DJ which plays everything from honky tonk girl to the cha cha slide, there was even some impromptu karaoke,   at one point one of the patrons got rowdy and one of the bartenders and his friends quickly dispatched him and put him to the curb, though an old man almost got knocked over in the process.  they have a toaster over and on previous occasions we've ordered tombstone pizza's the glasses are always frosted, and there's even a popcorn machine in back. They even have a chilled shot machine which I've yet to partake of.  The Deli doesn't look like much from appearances, and when you're thinking about what to wear that night "don't" you're fine as you are. no one judges here.  It might quite possibly be one of my favorite bars, just because it has character. We never really plan on going to the deli, we just kind of end up there.  P.S. if you ask the bartender you can play Wii on the Big Flatscreen in back.

We went camping here last weekend.  we found a great campsite where we didn't feel crowded by other campers, our site had water and electricity despite none of us thinking to bring anything to plug in.  It was a very windy day and despite some very frustrating attempts to build a fire, we still had fun. the lake was beautiful and was a great escape from the city and a chance to clear my head.  The staff patrolling around in golf carts were more than helpful and were almost immediately recommending camp sites to us.  we had plenty of room to setup multiple tents and had immediate access to the shoreline.  The only drawback was that it was really windy, which the park can't really be blamed for.  But we did have to drive almost 10 miles to Anthem to pickup firewood and beer, apparently the Marina has been bought out by peoria and is member's only, they are working on a second marina but it wasn't finished at the time of this writing.  Still it was a much needed relaxing weekend and I look forward to more like this in the future, lesson's learned   1. Bring plenty of beer/food/firewood/supplies  2. No matter how manly you think you are, sleeping on 1 inch pad on the hard cold ground is not fun, especially after multiple beers.  Air mattresses = good.  3. Wind was not primitive man's friend.

We decided to deviate from the norm last night and decided to check out little bite of italy.  It's tucked away in the back of a strip mall lacks curb appeal.  The interior was more reminiscient of a bowling alley with ugly carpeting and uncomfortable orange and yellow chairs.  Above the bar hangs an Air Cav unit emblem indicating the proprietor spent some time in Nam and it in no way embodies an italian restaurant hopefully the food is good.  We started with an order of toasted ravioli which was actually quite good, My meal included a salad and breadstick (singular).  The salad consisted of tomatoes, lettuce and onions.  Not being a fan of Tomatoes or Onions I reached for the parmesan and made the best of things.    (NOTE: There are these things call croutons, they're crunchy and they're awesome!!!)  I was also served a single lonely breadstick in a basket, feeling guilty I shared the breadstick with my wife.    For dinner I had ordered the linguine with clam sauce.  I ordered a half order but the portion size was still very big.  there was a lot of clam on the pasta, unfortunately the sauce was a bit of a let down and something was off about the taste.  My wife had ordered a stromboli but we couldn't help but think she was eating an oversized hot pocket.  The service was ok, our waiter was young and seemed absent minded and a couple of times we joked about dine and dashing because we were going to catch a movie after.  To be fair it was mothers day and the wait staff may have been off their game.  and the pizza looked good so at some point I'd like to come back and try the pizza.  the pizza will determine whether they gain or lose a star.  If you're in the neighborhood might be worth checking out, but not worth the drive if you're not.

We stopped here on saturday after dinner to catch up with some friends.  This bar is a no bullshit irish pub, it's not trying to be something it isn't.  They have all the beers you would expect an irish pub to have.  A sizeable bar, and ample seating.  Live entertainment singing old favorites from irish bands and old irish folk songs.  The only issue I had was as the night went on we couldn't hear ourselves talk as the music got progressively louder, but I suppose that's our own fault for going to an irish pub and sitting 10 feet from the stage..  Not a bad establishment.

We ended up at Ticoz last saturday night with some friends, what can I say the atmosphere is great.  The Food was delicious, the drinks were well made and the service was spot-on  I ordered the Jumbo Crispy Chimichanga, I have a bit of a love affair with chimichanga's and this dish did not disappoint.  They really don't joke around when they say "JUMBO" i barely finished it and left most of my rice and beans on the plate.  We also ordered some queso the chips for this are amazing, it's a shame they don't serve the same chips as courtesy chips but I can undestand due to cost,   My wife pointed out to me that they were San Pablo chips which are perfectly good and distributed by my company which in a way eating here put's a few cents in my 401K.  I had a peach margarita that was subtle and perfect.  and our waiter was kind of sassy, but in an amusing humorous kind of way, actually he was very attentive.  We will definitely be back, our waiter told us about a weekly brunch which I'd be enticed to try too.

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants, The Staff although a bit eccentric fits the place to a T.  A wide selection of German Beer's including Spaten, and Warsteiner, I personally prefer the Spaten Oktoberfest,   They don't know how to make bad soup, I just wish they gave you more, every time we've been here they've always had simple but awesome soup.  And of Course "Schnitzel" or as they call it on the menu  "The Art of Schnitzel" if pounding pork thin breading it then covering it with sauces, other meats, cheeses etc, is an art form, then consider me a discerning critic.  Though I must admit I tend to order the Schweizer Schnitzel, which has Ham and Emmanthaler cheese under the breading.  We've had the desserts in the past and the Strudel is very memorable, as well as the german chocolate cake.  Maybe this year we'll make it out for their actual Oktoberfest celebration, we've been meaning to go for years.  When I think of glendale I don't think of Germans, but this place makes me more and more want to take a vacation to Germany.

You know it was a good meal when over a month later you can still recall it in detail.  The Decor was very modern, I especially liked the large cup style chairs we sat in, very comfortable.  They had an extensive winelist but I just felt like drinking beer so I had a few Newcastles.    They start your experience by bringing out their duck fat fries with their special dipping sauces.  The duck fat fries alone are enough reason to come here.  I ordered off the prix fixe menu, and got the maryland crab chowder with a 16 oz rib eye with truffle mac n cheese and bacon creamed spinach.  the soup was good, very fresh seafood, the Rib eye was amazing and I was so happy to not pay $50+ for a non-petite portion. the truffle mac n cheese was really good, I just wish it had a larger portion, and so was the spinach.  the big hit was the mashed potato trio that my friend ordered, Horseradish mash, garlic mash and lobster mash, the big hit was definitely the lobster mash, the bowl was being scraped.  for dessert we had beignets that were deliciously flaky and served with various dips,  I had creme brulee, but I believe there were some chocolate variations as well.  All in all an amazing meal, I hope to make it back sometime.

About a month ago my Car got wrecked in an accident that wasn't my fault.  even though the other drivers insurance takes care of repairs and a rental car.  It's still very upsetting to be without your car for an extended period of time.  A friend recommended that I take my car to Sterling for the repairs.  Sterling was completely professional, gave me nearly daily updates via text, and called me multiple times each week to update me on the status of my repairs.  When all was said and done, the repairs were completed nearly a week early.  When I went to pick up my car, everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, explained what was repaired, handed me some paperwork and my keys and I was on my way and back to normal.  utter professionalism and quality service.

I used to come here a few years ago when i was working in the area, the group would like to meet here for lunch occasionally.  I haven't been back in a while and a few weeks ago I was craving chinese food but I wanted variety, I decided to stop in and get a take-out box.    It's hard to gauge what to expect when anything is sold by the pound, a lot of things are sold by the pound but that doesn't necessarily mean they're good.  for example, Dog Food, Fertilizer, Nuts, Fruit, Candy, Gold Ingots, Seafood, Horse Hair, Cookies, Soap, Coffee, Turkey, Building Materials, Meat Products, Olives, Scrap Metal, Uranium and apparently Chinese Food.  I filled up a take-home box and didn't feel I was overstuffing the box or having any difficulty closing the box, but apparently this was 2.4 pounds of food and was over $10 for some cheap takeout.  I'm somewhat convinced they use MSG and ingredients that make the food literally heavier.  Not wanting to give up, a friend and I stopped by here last weekend to eat lunch and dined in. the items on the buffet aren't bad and scratch the itch.  But everything is mediocre as you would expect buffet food to be.  the 1 star comes from how the food made me sick that evening, and made me feel nauseous for most of the night.  I will most likely not be back.

I went to Maui Grille when they first opened and have been there probably a total of 3 times now, I think this place has a lot of potential but I find there's always something off about my meal, once I ordered the macadamia crusted tilapia and I think the rice they served with it was the blandest rice I've ever had, and then I can recall another time ordering a shrimp dish, where out of the 4 island sauces it was paired with I think I only found 1 enjoyable and I quickly ran out and don't remember the server coming back before finishing my meal that I could get more.  which is a shame because I am one that reallly enjoys seafood and I want this to be an option for me and it could be, just the food tends to be bland so more often than not I would find myself going for another option.

We stopped by Switch last weekend for lunch, we'd previously tried Fez and Ticoz and enjoyed both.  So we had high expectations for Switch, luckily they didn't dissapoint.  I ordered the Murano Chicken and Prosciutto, normally I'm not a huge fan of cold sandwiches, when there's a perfectly good hot alternative,  but I'm willing to make an exception.  The sandwich doesn't look like a threat at first glance, but I must admit I struggled to finish it, I'm also a big fan of Olives and found many of their menu items make good use of this neglected vegetable.  The waiter gave us a caraffe which actually worked out really well and never found our drinks going empty. The atmosphere was very eclectic and this seems like it would be a fun night spot too.  Hope to come back soon and try a Caiphirina (I probably misspelled that)

I really enjoy Scoreboards, it doesn't look like much from the outside and the interior is a bit antiseptic for an Irish pub, but the service always seems to be attentive and consistent, the food is always good, and the drinks are reasonably priced.  I especially enjoy the 1/3 lbs scoreburger, with irish beer battered fries and the fact that they don't charge extra to add items like mushrooms to your burger, in fact I think the only thing they charge extra for is bacon which is only like 50 cents, for happy hour I like to enjoy a tall cold smithwicks possibly the fried cabbage rolls or if I'm feeling extra really hungry I could recommend the white cheddar cheese curds.  The servers seem to remember us. they even have live music, Imagine an old weathered ireland born man with long hair and a cowboy hat singing Johnny Cash covers with a thick dublin accent, it really doesn't get any better than this  "I harr that train a combin"  the interior is a little odd for an irish pub/sports bar with the lack of booths and floor to ceiling windows, but everything else seems to make up for this. Scoreboards is doing a great job of fulfilling the role of a neighborhood grill/pub and I look forward to going back soon.

I've been to Fuzzy's twice now and don't think I'll be returning, the first time my Wife and I went about a year ago we couldn't find a seat inside.  the sign said seat yourself we sat on the patio and after about 20 minutes a server never acknowledged our presence.  Even though they looked at our table several times.  The second time was after a work christmas party with a few friends we stumbled in about 10PM to check out their Karaoke, some interesting characters, this time the server acknowledged us and brought us a round of drinks but they never checked on us again over a period of maybe 45 minutes to an hour, and eventually I went to the bar and asked for the tab.  Oddly enough the people that seemed like regulars we're getting service.  dissappointing to say the least.

Last sunday I was out with my Brother in Law and one of his friends and no one could decide on where to eat lunch.  we were downtown coming back from mesa.  and decided to come back to the west valley because we know the area.  His friend suggests Which Wich.  Which I've never had (that's a lot of which's) so we show up at westgate and I'm immediately bombarded with a world of sandwich possibilites not yet known to me.  I like the concept of using the sandwich bag to write down your order and customize it.  not sure how the food is I be safe and order a muffeletta nurturing my love affair with all things olive, I even checked the box next to black olives, so I'd be getting olives on top of my olives.  When in line I notice they have their own kind of natural/home made chips, so I pick up a bag.  first I tried the chips and found they were nice and crunchy as well as perfectly seasoned.  the sandwich wasn't the best I've ever had, but was still very good, the Olive tampenade spread was a bit lacking and thinly applied., but the sandwich was well prepared and still very tasty.  the sandwiches are only about 8 inches so if you've got your A-game appetite go somewhere else or order 2, otherwise good size for lunch.  They advertised a surf and turf sandwich with roast beef and seafood, maybe next time I'll be bold enough to try it.

My favorite spot for Coffee in town, I spent my financially unstable, irresponsible post college years loafing around at the mesa coffee shops and got used to a certain caliber of coffee that only true "barrista's" can make as opposed to the so called Starbucks Barrista's or Coffee artists or what ever the %*#@ their called make. I'm a fan of the snickerlicious or just the traditional mocha iced or hot, though lately I've got onboard the iced coffee train. everything I've had has been good quality, another interesting touch is coffee ice, if you order an iced drink they actually use frozen coffee cubes as the ice, so even when the ice melts it doesn't spoil your drink.  they have a drive through and they're usually pretty quick,one of my friends that used to loaf around mesa with me always insists on going here when he's on my side of town. prices are reasonable, and they don't feel the need to blend italian and french nonsensical words as drink names just for the heck of it.   good place to stop for coffee if you're in the area.

Stir Fry Paradise reminds me of when I used to live in Mesa and my roommate and I would go to Y.C.'s and gorge ourselves on noodles and meat.  I was never the packing champ but he was, one time he got a full large bowl and a small bowl in one trip through the line and still had two take home cartons after eating a mountain of noodles.  I hear they've amended the rules in recent years, but I digress.  Stir Fry Paradise does an excellent job on delivering exactly what their name states, all you can eat Mongolian style BBQ,  build your own stir fry at a very reasonable price.  Previous posters mention just how clean this establishment is, you walk in and look around and you can tell just how much care they put into keeping their restaurant in the most cleanly and sanitary condition possible.  The Stir Fry bar is setup very well with all the vegetables and ingredients you would expect. All of the ingredients seemed fresh and in good condition. The staff also did a good job of not cross contaminating my bowl with someone elses, I've been to places like this before where once your stir fry hits the grill, it gets passed around like a lady of the night and you usually don't get back quite what you handed them.  I opted for a Lo Mein style stir fry with beef, chicken, mushrooms, water chestnuts, carrots, bean sprouts and cabbage.  I do wish these places would post a handful of sauce recipes on a board, I've been notoriously bad at over or under seasoning my noodles in the past.  However this time around my instincts must have been right, I made a hoisin based sauce with their house sauce and lots of garlic sauce that turned out pretty tasty and didn't need a drop of soy sauce.  I did think their sauces were more flavorful than some Mongolian BBQ style places I've been, and once cooked they had a better consistency then I've had before.  I ended up with a mountain of noodles that I thought I couldn't finish but somehow did.  Additionally they also have a pre-prepared buffet style section with items like crab puffs, egg rolls, wanton, I believe Sweet and Sour pork, possibly sesame chicken, these fried sugar coated donuts, and of course what no restaurant of this caliber would be without "Jello". which I actually did partake in a little bit of. Other than a single egg roll I didn't really try the buffet area much but that's only because I was more than satisfied with my stir fry which is what I came for anyways.  I really enjoyed stir fry paradise and hope to come back often.  maybe next time my eyes won't be bigger than my bowl and I'll actually try the buffet items.

I was born and raised in Illinois so I'm somewhat partial to the Chicago Style pizza with the sweeter sauce, I do however find Lucky's to be one of the better pizza places in the area, The owners have a new york brashness with thick accents and like to joke with the customers "we no make small, Ok, for you we make small" *overheard once waiting for my pizza" I've been here a few times for lunch when I used to work in the area, lunch specials can be had for about $5 including drink, and this has been one of our go to pizza places for dinner, the slices are large, best eaten folded, the wings are good quality in comparison to some less than desirable wings I've had other places. I don't think they deliver but every time I call for takeout they always say 10-15min and whenever I show up 10-15min later a hot fresh pie is waiting for me.  For the price of a generic like Papa Johns or Pizza Hut (which I technically only classify as pizza by definition) some good NY style pizza and wings can be head.  My pick for NY Style pizza on the west side

I walked into lucky's tonight to find it busier than I've ever seen it. Despite that they were still making sure everyone got acknowledged and got the correct order. The food was awesome as usual, my sister-in-law seemed to especially enjoy the fried zuchinni being that there was none left.  I'm glad to see a local business like this thriving despite an economy where so many family owned establishments are closing their doors.

A nice change in pace when you get tired of the OG and Carraba's, the appetizers are tasty recommend the pesto bruchetta or the baked ravioli, the sauce is loaded with italian sausage and at times I find myself just eating the sauce with a fork, I'm a big fan of their calzone's lots of cheese, ample toppings puff's up like a good calzone should, the wait staff has been agreeable the times we've been there though we more often than not take out. I've also had the pizza and some pasta dishes and have been pleased with most, as I recall the sauces for one of the sausage and vodka sauce pasta's is "very spicy" and i'm not one to shy away from spicy food, so just a warning.  a good choice for italian in surprise

I seriously feel like the last man on earth to try Mazie's, over the last few months my wife has went a few times, as well as some of our friends and I hear nothing but stellar reviews.  somehow every time we would plan to go they would either be too busy and someone from our party was not willing to wait, or plans changed at the last minute.  Luckily last night I was finally able to see what Mazie's was all about.   We ended up meeting up with fellow Yelpers Melissa H and Chris H, it was a beautiful night so it was very fitting that we sat outside.  our waiter was very prompt and kept up with our table very well, It wasn't a slow night by any means but the usual hustle and bustle was absent and everything just slowed down for a few hours.  We all had a glass of wine and shared the spinach artichoke dip, the flavor was subtle and not overpoweringly salty like some dishes I've had, the consistency was good too.  We all Ordered off the sandwich/lunch menu, I Ordered the pizza burger and was not disappointed, the burger was thick and hearty, stuffed with pepperoni sausage and cheese, topped with a rich marinara.  We ended up staying about 3 hours just talking and catching up and even after we'd paid the bill they still checked up on us several times to see if we needed anything and made it clear that we could stay as long as we wanted.  All in all a good night.

Ok call me weird but I'm one of those people that is always generating static electricity, and for some reason this walmart is like a tesla coil to me, there's something with the way the shelves and freezer cases are grounded that whenever I touch. Them, without skipping a beat I always get shocked and it's never subtle always a big pop and possibly some numb fingertips, I don't know maybe it's because I work in IT so my body has a natural charge, maybe I'm like the girl from Heroe's and I don't know it,  Avoid this place if you have static issues, otherwise the selection is nice and I can't complain about a fresh sushi counter

My wife and I were excited to see something as formal as vogue come to surprise, we were interested to here that the chef was actually french and why in the world she would come to surprise, but the more that I think about it "why the heck not" .  Overall our service experience has been good, the waitresses seem to remember us when we come back,  if you're not looking to spend $$$ some very high quality burgers can be had for around $10. I often lean towards the fish dishes and have been very pleased with what I've received up to this point. the cocktails are quite tasty as well, although I admit it's difficult for a straight man to order a "chenel" martini with a straight face  I would definitely recommend Vogue Bistro if find yourself in the surprise area looking for a semi-formal dining experience, or even just lunch or cocktails.

We've seen a lot of movies at this theatre in recent month and figured it was time to give my two cents.    For one it's no AMC or Harkin's but I don't see that as a bad thing.  although the layout and some of the scale and grandeur experienced at some other AZ megaplexes is lost.  After a quick walkthrough of this theatre you will quickly realize that the entire facility is state of the art.  The movie posters are actual LCD's that move and change, the bathroom has a hand dryer that's revolutionary. Even the vending machine that I paid a 500% markup for a bottle of water had a robotic arm scan and pick my beverage. (when did we decide that  twist... thud!!! wasn't good enough)  All the movies are presented in what I think they call Pure Digital, which I don't know what it is, but it looks and sounds phenomenal.  An Usher comes in to every theatre before the movie and introduces the movie which gives it a very personal touch.  And they have these new seats that they can't stop talking about and would try them if not for the fact that the ad they use shows a wave moving across the ass of the seat.  I can't speak for the food because I don't go to the movie theatre to eat, If I wanted to pay 5 times the price for seven eleven food I'd (actually I don't know where I'd go, that's just kind of a shitty practice in the industry)  overall the seats are comfortable, the presentation quality is good, the movies tend to start on time with most of the previews shown before start time (genious).  This theatre is different but so far hasn't deceived me.

I've had the pizza here once and it was decent compared to the generic triad (papa, dom, and the hut) unfortunately they seem determined to keep me from trying their pizza again, living only a mile or two away from this place we always get coupons for them on our door handle and they are generally pretty good deals, unfortunately everytime I call for delivery fate intervenes and decides I should eat somewhere else.  the first time I called no one answered, the second time I tried someone picked up and put me on hold to eventually hang up on me, to call back to be put back on hold to never get my call answered, I want to eat your pizza but I don't see why you won't answer your phone to take my order.

Me and the wife tend to get around the valley despite our westside digs, one of these places was the kokopelli winery/bistro in chandler, I wouldn't call us connoseurs but we have an appreciation for wine and aren't afraid to invest in a few bottles when we find a nice wine shop.  Kokopelli has been one of these consistent wines, we tend to lean towards sweet whites and find they offer some derivation of almost all or our favorite varietals (reisling, muscat, sauvignon etc) The food has always been consistently good and we were thrilled when we heard we were getting a Kokopelli in surprise, after visiting the surprise location, we were pleased to find that the same consistency and quality carries over from the chandler location, at my last visit I ordered the fish and chips, which were severals strips of tilapia wiht crunchy tasty panko breading. the atmosphere is casual especially with the sun city crowd, they usually have live music a few nights a week.  We'll definitely be visiting this place more often now that they're in our neighborhood

Despite Christine S and her stellar review, I'd have to say "Surprise you can do better" I've eaten country kitchen 3 times at time of this review, the food is nothing denny's IHOP or village inn don't offer, I'm a bit of a sucker for fish fry's so the one time we actually dined in, I had the fish fry and it's not bad, but nothing special. we've gotten their breakfast to go on a lazy weekend morning, the pancakes are decent, however my breakfast seemed to be kind of sparse on meat,   the other night we got back from happy hour and appetizers with some coworkers of mine and we were still hungry, not feeling like fast food we call up country kitchen and order an order of their sliders and 2 milkshakes. they don't give us an eta or a total on the phone.  so I wait about 10-15 minutes, leave my house which is about 2 mi away, arrive at the restaurant to find it completely barren at about 7:30PM, I approach the counter and the manager just continues to mess with his blackberry never looking up eventually, a hostess comes from the back and greets me, mind you it's already been 15 minutes and all they need to do was grill some small beef pattys and drop some fries, I still end up waiting another 10 minutes for my food, only to have everyone disappear into the back of the restaurant again to have another server come out confused and try to seat me. eventually I get the food, the sliders aren't bad, but there's only 3, WTF it's an unwritten rule that sliders come in even numbers, I don't know if it's just me, or working in a White Castle as a teen, but 3 sliders could potentially cause a rift in some relationships,   the decor is an orgy of applebees, IHOP and denny's but imagine if you arrived  at the "campy wall crap" store only to find they'd already been cleaned out by an applebees corporate decorator, the decorations range from giant utensils, wireframe art, sports posters and scenic views.  I'm really not sure which direction they were trying to go.  unfortunately Country Kitchen is the closest full service restaurant to my home so I will probably end up back here some lazy saturday morning picking up eggs and pancakes.  I was excited to see Surprise Pointe being built and to see more services coming closer to me, so far I've only seen more of the same.

Our goto for subs in surprise, unlike subway they actually have the meat slicer right behind the counter and slice the meat fresh before your eyes, they have a variety of bread choices and do both cold and hot subs, they offer four different sizes I believe the largest is 16" I usually eat half and take the other half to work the next day. they also have fresh baked brownies and cookies (you can tell because they're different shapes and wrapped in celophane instead of vacuum seal)  But the best part "THEY DELIVER" I don't think people use this service a lot because when you call they act like they've never delivered a sub before, but for a few dollars extra you can actually have something other than pizza or chinese delivered to your door.  my goto for a cold sub in surprise

After hearing so much about sidebar and actually seeing the place I was quite impressed that the hype was backed up.  although it doesn't seem like a big space there could have easily been 75 people in there that night.  despite that I never had issues getting service and consistency.  I'm assuming they don't have drink waitresses because one never came by our party's area but that was ok.  Everytime I needed a drink for myself or my wife I was able to go up to "side" of the "bar" (I'm pretty sure this isn't why it's called that) and quickly get acknowledged added to my tab and on my merry way. and yes you can smell the pei wei, though I didn't order any, coincidentally myself and Chris H who was also at Sidebar that night ended up eating at that very same pei-wei not 2 days later.  All in all a very fun and cool bar( reasonably priced too)

The first thing I noticed when walking into Mike's was an easle with two documents posted to a bulletin board.  The first says in big bold letters, that the AZ Republic mistakenly wrote that they had 5 critical health code violations, but if you look at the report you will see that there are none.  The other document is the actual health board report.  My wife and I arrived before the rest of our party and we're seated promptly.   The decor is kind of mixed, some tuscan style murals on the wall, with a fake rooftop/awning that surrounds the restaurant I suppose to create the feeling of being in some kind of tuscan courtyard,  lots of track lighting dimmed to create an ambience to mask the fact that the building was designed to be a warehouse.  Overall they actually do a pretty good job of creating an atmosphere.  The service was a bit slow, but my beverage service never seemed to suffer, which makes me suspect the issues were more in the kitchen than the wait staff.  I ordered a double-thick stuffed pork loin chop from their specials menu which was described as a thick tender pork loin stuff with fontina cheese served with a mushroom, proscuttio and sausage demi-glace.  It seemed like we waited a long time for our order however it included soup which was nice, I had a cup of clam chowder, nothing special but not bad.  They also kept bring us more bread which I find a lot of restaurants are almost hesitant to give more than 1 or 2 bread services, the bread was served with a cup of hummus which wasn't terrible, but kind of watery and at this point sorry but FEZ has ruined me for all other hummus's.  The food finally came and this is where they made up their fourth star, the pork loin was very good and perfectly cooked I really enjoyed the demi-glace and it was served with I believe a squash and some kind of potato side which was very good.  for dessert I ended up ordering a slice of cheesecake hopefully to share, none of the adults at the table wanted to share with me and I was feeling very full, luckily my year and a half old niece was with us and although her vocal skills are limited she displayed her approval by thrusting the spoon in my general direction each time I gave her a bite.  Overall a good dining experience, Did I mention that Mike greeted us and checked on our table twice through our meal.  I always like restaurants where ownerscirculate to make themselves known but don't lurk.  The food was a bit slow coming, however I failed to mention my Father-in-Law ordered a braised osso bucco lamb shank which may have increased preperation time.  I would definitely go back to Mike's but would like my meal to take less than 2 hours.

I don't know if I'm just being pretentious but why do we expect so little from fast food restaurants, anymore I can't feed myself in a drive thru for less than $7-8 which would buy me a much more appetizing lunch at some other restaurants   I find that no matter what this location always misses something on my order, If I'm lucky they just short me the condiments that they asked me if I wanted over the speaker, otherwise they will just give me the wrong order or neglect to put sandwiches in the bags, usually our exchanges are silent, because have a nice day or thank you would be borderline on some form of customer service. it just worries me that if this is this nations next great generation that will be entering the workplace in a few years that can't even say thank you or have a nice day when they thrust an overpriced quarter pounder and fries through the window what do my fellow generation Y,X er's have to look forward to in the coming years.  I guess my biggest point of conflict is the use of the "Double Checked for Accuracy" stickers that McDonald's started using to seal the bags, which apparently someone at corporate thought paradoxical stickers that create the illusion of quality is better than actually fulfilling the prophecy, personally I would feel better if they said " Half-Assed and Over Priced" preferably with smiley face too.

Ok, now keep in mind a 5 star rating is in the eye of the reviewer, although I know most women wouldn't be caught dead in a great clips, most men aside to the metro's care enough about their hair for it to not look like total crap.   That said, I've been going to this great clips for a couple of years now, and I always go back just because they are consistent.  For one they know how to cut my hair better than I do.  They seem to record and keep their customer hairstyle preference in their computer, so most times I can just sit down sit back and 20-30 minutes later be looking much better than when I walked in.  The stylist are young and most of them are friendly and talkative but don't push the matter if you're not feeling particularly chatty that day. also 13.00 feels like a steal, I know how much my wife and some women pay for their hair and to me it seems ridiculous, but I guess it's a matter of priorities.  addtionally it's located not 50 feet from the front door to my neighborhood safeway, so it's almost relieving sometimes to arrive and find they have a 20 minute wait which gives me just enough time to walk next door and pickup some odds and ends.  I know it's not exactly a world class salon, but for a guy like me, it serves me exactly the way I need it. so 5 stars from this reviewer.

I found myself leaving work late last night on the drive home looking forward to a good meal.  Only to find out that my Wife was having dinner with her Mother and I was on my own.  Feeling like something different I start cruising around surprise looking to see if anything new sprang up.    I remembered seeing the sign for Mei Wei and wondered if they thought maybe they would get more business by varying their namesake by one letter to the popular chain.  Nonetheless I decided to stop in.  I walked in and the the restaurant had a dark mood lit feel, but was actually well decorated.  It also appeared very clean.   I was immediately greeted and the staff was very cordial,  I started looking over a menu to get take out and was offered a recommendation.    I should have been weary when they offered the Orange Peel Chicken.  but I gave it a chance because they used the word peel and just orange chicken, got an order of egg rolls too just to try.   10 minutes later my food was ready and I was on my way.  I got home and was pleasantly surprised by the portion size and including the egg rolls probably could have fed 2 people.  The food itself unfortunately was mediocre, the usual white rice and crispy meat faire, which isn't bad but for 12.50 I was expecting a bit more.  Food was ok but lacked any sort of flare or appeal, almost wonder if this would be a better lunch destination.  It's official Surprise is culturally bankrupt when it comes to Chinese/Asian food.  I might try it again, but don't hold your breath.  Better wipe the lipstick off my collar before Pei Wei finds out.

Finally made it back to the brookside after it reopened, met up with the wife and her coworkers there on friday for happy hour and a light dinner.  I admit I arrived a little later than the rest of the party but it couldn't have been more than 5-10 minutes.  Upon arrival I found out there was only one waitress for the entire floor which was probably 4000 sq ft and 20+ tables, and it was reasonably busy.  The rest of my party had already ordered food and had drinks. Wow this awesome GM must not grasp the concept that on friday afternoon's starting around 3-4ish mass amounts of people tend to like to drown away their sorrows. I ordered a fried shrimp basket and after about 5 minutes got my beer,  then after another 20 or so minutes the rest of my party received their food.  I proceeded to wait what felt like an additional half hour or more to get my food, and most of my party was finishing up their food.  (this always bugs me being the last person to get their food, you have the feeling everyone else wants to leave, but you're still hungry)  I'm not sure of the exact time but I recall checking the time and it had been around an hour.  to their credit the shrimp was pretty good, and the beer was very cold.  The menu a shadow of it's former self looks like a Fortune 500 company after it's latest quarterly earnings meeting. all in all a bit of a disappointment, being that the original incarnation of the brookside had it's share of unresolved problems to begin with.  I wouldn't say I wouldn't go back, but I don't think it's something I would suggest when asked.

Last night we had a craving for mexican food and we remembered seeing a coupon in the Savvy Shopper for Las Fuentes which recently opened in surprise.  The coupon we had was for buy one entree get on free of equal or lesser value up to 8.99.  being that we just had our yard landscaped a free entree was very enticing.  We arrived to find a well decorated mexican restaurant, we started looking over the menu and after a few minutes we started to think the joke was that nothing on the menu costs less than 8.99 except salads.  luckily my wife was able to find a tostada for 8.50, I ordered the fountain sampler which was their appetizer sampler platter.  We got our food shortly after.  Both plates were huge, I had a mountain of nachos, several quesadillas, taquitos, and mini-chimichanga's.  the nachos were very cheesy and tasty and I really enjoyed the mini-chimi's.  I probably only ate half the plate and had plenty of leftovers.  Overall the food was very good.  the coupon was a bit offsetting though when the average menu price was 14.99.  I'd like to come back when we're less broke and order some of the more specialized entrees.

after seeing them building it for months and reading the menu on their national website we were somewhat intrigued.  from appearances it reminded me of a similar place in the peoria/glendale area http://www.freddysfrozencustard.com/  which seems to adopt the chicago theme.  I found similar offerings at Culvers with the thin steak-burger style stacked burgers, which they call butterburgers, as well as frozen custard served ala DQ blizzard style which were similarly called concrete mixers.  I ordered a double mushroom swiss butterburger with cheese curds and a concrete mixer.  I found it interesting that they ask you what condiments you want on every sandwich.  I'm so used to just having the blanks penciled in for me that I was like a dear in headlights.  The food was pretty good, the burger was juicy and satisfying.  the cheese curds were good, I've had better at some bars but not bad for fast food. the custard was good but didn't seem quite on par with some of the other places that offer custard in the area.  all in all, it was a satisfying meal, and I would go back

We got excited when we saw this place being built in the plaza on grand. And after the dismal overpriced failure that was House of Kabob's  Surprise has been too long without a source of greek food, a craving that I get every so often but usually have to be willing to travel a great distance to satisfy.  We both got the Gyro Pita's which includes a Drink, a sizeable helping of french fries and a large Gyro loaded with tasty gyro meat.  I of course added feta which made this a truly craveable experience. We ordered a side greek salad and it was more than enough for the two of us to share. the prices were more than reasonable and I will definitely be going back.

had greek corner again last night.  thought I would mention that they changed their fries.  previously they were using large thick steak fries which were kind of bland.  They are now using thinner crispier natural cut herb seasoned fries which are very good.  The Gyro was still amazing.

We stopped in at the Irish Wolfhound last night on a wim for a beer, little did we know that it was their "official" grand opening, they've been open for a few months and we've been meaning to try them.  We walked in the door and the man on stage playing irish folksongs on his guitar actually stopped his song pointed at us and said "DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION"  the indoor part of the bar was packed, so we decided to check out the outdoor patio.  the patio was busy but we were able to easily find a table, let me also mention that the chair have this plush padding on them, and also not all of the space heaters were running just a few so there wasn't that weird outdoor sweatbox effect.  A server greated us within a minute or two and took our drink orders, they had my favorite irish beer "Smithwick's" a few minutes later we had our beers and they took our food order.  I decided to order the Ciaran's Fish and Chip's Sandwich which included a cup of soup, I chose the Irish Coast Seafood Chowder.    Now I have this thing about soup with certain restaurants, my theory is that if a restaurant has one good soup, usually all there other soups are just as good.  The soup I had was amazing, creamy chowder with either shrimp/prawns, calamari and I believe scallops, very hearty and we were very excited to find out you can get soup to go for very reasonable prices.  My wife doesn't share the same pension for seafood that I do, so she chose the Potato Leak soup with her meal which I also tried and was just as delicious.   Our meals came and my sandwich was good size with a piece of fish that took up most of the roll with coleslaw on top of the fish filet.  The sandwich was Delicious, imagine if the Filet of Fish from McDonalds had a cousin that went back to college and finished his degree, that would be this sandwich. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it, I'm pretty sure they batter the fish with Guiness.  we stayed a bit longer and had a few beers, our server was on top of things despite the drunken chinese fire drill that was occurring on the patio and inside.  We will definitely be back.

I went here with a friend the other night for dinner.  The Service was good, the space was clean.  The average Roll Price ranges from $5 to $8  with some special rolls costing a bit more.  We split about 4 Rolls and each had a Kirin. The California Crunch rolls were tasty, the spicy Crab was a big hit with my friend, and the Crunchy Tempura Shrimp with eel sauce was my favorite.    We also tried one of their many special rolls, we went for the "Booty Booty Roll" not just for the name but because it seemed to have a complex flavor profile.  based on our personal tastes, we didn't find the  Booty Booty Roll to be   "Rockin Everywhere"  but it was good, just maybe too many flavors at once, I would probably go for something simpler next time.  I also saw some of the other food coming out of the kitchen and it looked good, and being that the thought of raw fish would disgust my wife I know she'd be able to find something to eat too.  I plan to come back soon.

Since saddle ranch opened I didn't feel I could compose an adequate opinion after only seeing ENORMOUS mixed drinks and women gyrating on a mechanical bull.  I felt I needed to at least try the food to form an opinion.  If you've never been one of the first things you'll notice is that every waitress is dressed like a slutty cowgirl. (personally I don't disapprove) but might not be the place to take grandma, unless she's into that.  Other than that our waitress was actually very attentive.  Ok the food...  I found myself conflicted between the Ranch BBQ Burger and the Original N.Y.O. lucky for me I didn't have to make that choice and my awesome wife agreed to order the Ranch BBQ Burger and let me taste it.  After a short while our food came and all dishes were served on what I can only describe as a slab this thing was like 2 ft wide.  My Omelette was huge filled with black forest ham, three peper bacon which was really tasty and tequilla chicken sausage, not to mention a huge helping of hashbrowns.  Keep in mind this is one of the more modest sized dishes. I also tasted my wife's burger and from the little bite I had I would definitely order it.  The waitress asked us if we would like dessert and we politely declined, despite this they decided to give our party a half baked cookie and ice cream dessert on the house.  Even though we were all really full, the cookie dessert was amazing.  Theres something about saddle ranch that like that  I can't describe, It's tasteless, tacky and everything that usually turns me off.  But whatever it is it has a certain charm to me and day or night I place I would come back to.  Maybe because it's not located in Scottsdale proper.

Wife took me here after stopping by here on a whim with some friends a few weeks earlier, I don't know what metrics you judge a frozen yogurt shop on but I'll have to say it was quite delicious.  The shop is clean, the yogurt is self serve, they have several machines on the back wall and each machine has 2 flavors w an additional middle handle for swirl, I put like 5 different flavors in my cup and then assaulted it with their generous toppings bar, they had fresh toppings too, but my cup was already looking a little too ambitious by the time I got that far.  for 2 Generous cups of frozen yogurt, and a water bottle approx $10. And I must say the running board walls and classic car theme has to make this the manliest frozen yogurt shops I've ever seen.

Meh...  Not sure what to think of this place, the wife and I decided to try it out in favor of trying some new surprise restaurants.  You walk in there appear to be servers, with a seat yourself vibe because there is no sign that says otherwise.  We sit down and a few min later one of the "servers" comes over and tells us that we order at the counter and they bring us the food, ok, change "servers" to "runners" no big deal moving on. I noticed once we were seated another family came in and same episode repeated, nothing wrong with the counter approach, just some signage would be good.  I'd been craving a pastrami burger and one of the reason I came was to try their pastrami burger. I order the pastrami burger, the wife orders a pastami sandwich and we split an order of chili cheese fries. I ask for them to add Swiss to her pastrami sandwich, "we don't have swiss" only american, ok no cheese. apparently the only cheese they have is american, later I started going over the menu contemplating how many items would be better with Swiss.  we get the food at the table and it looks good, the runner was friendly and asked if we needed anything else.  My burger is well cooked, looks good and fresh, the taste is mediocre, nothing wrong, but nothing standing out the pastrami seems bland in comparison to some others, a bit too salty as well.  The fries were crispy which is a big plus, the chili was pretty good as well  My didn't even eat half of her sandwich I could tell these some thing off-putting about it.  All in all a good meal, but not for foodies, perfectly prepared fresh, pedestrian food in my opinion.  still I want to like this place because it has a lot of potential, maybe if I come back you'll wow me with the "eggs"  and please get the swiss situation under control it's delicious.

We came in on a Saturday night, someone from our party had made a reservation for a large party, the host stand didn't know what we were talking about, and had to go ask the other staff, it turns out whoever took the reservation didn't think passing that along to the host was necessary.  Though, I'm not sure why they even inquired on the reservation when there were probably 3 customers in the whole restaurant.  multiple school buses of senior citizens could have showed up and they'd still have ample seating.  despite this they moved some tables around and promptly seated us  I can say their beer selection is not bad, they have a reasonably wide selection from a number of different breweries, we got our drinks, and luckily this was a talkative bunch because otherwise the next 2 hours would have been a lot more awkward.  looking over the menu there's a wide assortment of dishes. I opted for the beer battered cod with rustic fries and homemade slaw.  Our server on multiple occasions told us our entrees were coming right up, but this seemed to drag out for at least an hour. eventually 5 out of our party of 8 got their entrees coincidentally they had all ordered the keg burger, my wife reported her burger as being somewhat bland. and just from appearance the fries didn't look very "Rustic" unless rustic means not very crisp and look like they'd been sitting too long  Actually I just looked up Rustic,if that was the intent I'm never ordering anything Rustic ever again.  (Rustic : constructed or made in a plain and simple fashion, in particular.)  So a few minutes later our server explains that one of the Kitchen staff walked out, so we're still waiting on the other 3 entrees,  as other reviewers have mentioned, nothing was offered in consolation, not a comped drink, not a dessert, and no bread, seriously is it that hard to keep bread on hand.  So probably another 30 minutes goes by, I finally get my food, I would call it "Not Bad" the beer batter isn't bad the portion was 3 good sized pieces, the fish was cooked well enough, the fries we're "Rustic", but I hadn't eaten lunch so I ate them, the slaw was actually pretty good.  but the beer battered fish isn't something I can't get 10 other places with better service and prices. definitely wasn't worth $12  probably another 5-10 minutes goes by and the last 2 people in our party that had ordered the skewers finally get their food. NOTE: at this point there were still probably 3 tables in the entire restaurant, not exactly what I"d call a dinner rush.  After a while the manager comes over and apologizes claims it's not his day, explains again that a chef had quit,  supposedly he gave the 2 people that had ordered skewers 2 dollars off their meals, because apparently he thought that was sufficient to repair the damage.  To The Owners: these bad service experiences seem to be spreading fast, I understand it's a new restaurant and you may be finding your feet, but if you want your doors to be open a few months down the road, you need to understand the value of customer service, it's ok to make mistakes, but if you make a mistake and your customer pays for it they won't be your customer, if you make a mistake it's on you to repair that relationship, either in the form of taking charge and making up for poor service, or COMPING the hell out of your diners bills, you could have COMPED every drink and still made $150 off our table just on food.  Instead you took us for about $200 and knocked off a whopping $4 from the diners who waited 90 minutes for their food.  the part you don't see is you'll never get a dollar out of those 8 wallets again, and you could have if you made it right which you didn't, IT TOTALLY SUCKS that your chef quit, but that's not your customer's problem and your customers are free to go somewhere else if you don't acknowledge that.  Hope you get your shit together.

My wife heard about this place through friends, some of whom are fans of smoke. Stopped in to pick up the family pack enough pulled pork for 4-6 2 sides (coleslaw, cheesy potatoes) and buns $25.  Obviously we put some of the slaw on the sandwiches, and added a little extra sauce that was generously supplied. very enjoyable, more of a vinegar based sauce but good flavor, pork was perfect flavor and texture, and the slaw was the kind I could just grab a fork and go to town on.  It seemed like they had a busy lunch rush since when I arrived there was a sign that they were out of brisket and ribs until dinner. may be advisable to call ahead about availability if you have a particular meat on the brain.  We'll be eager to go back and try the brisket and ribs.
