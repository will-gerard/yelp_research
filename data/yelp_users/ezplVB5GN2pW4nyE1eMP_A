Location in Chandler allows for quick access to highways and Chandler Fashion Mall. The amenities are very nice and the pool area even has a sand beach! The grounds appear well maintained and the annual party is loads of fun, but this is where I end the pleasantries of this review.  I am not sure if it applies to all Mark Taylor apartments, but they have some issues with policies and enforcement.  When my wife and I were looking at apartments, we had heard that Mark Taylor apartments were very good in general. We had come to find out that they have a policy where cats are required to be declawed. Since we did not want to put our two cats through that type of procedure just to be allowed to rent from Mark Taylor, we obviously had to look elsewhere.  We had a group of friends over to enjoy the pool with some drinks in hand and have been approached by the staff to keep drinks 4 feet from the pool edge. We were fine with the policy, but the staff were very rude about enforcing it and only enforced it for our group of friends. There were other people nearby that were apparently "above" the policy. It also seems odd that they relax the policy for their own functions like the annual party. If you have a policy, it should be enforced equally and without prejudice.  My friend who lives there had also noticed discrimination from staff in regards to reserving the club house. In particular, he was denied access to reserve the club house because it was "previously booked". Checking the club house on the "booked" day revealed that it was actually empty...all day. Nobody would pay to book the club house and not use it, so this behavior on behalf of the staff is suspicious and unacceptable.

Overpriced compared to most other department stores, but they offered us a great deal on air conditioner installation (wall-style). The process to actually get it installed was incredibly frustrating though. It took about 10 calls to people who kept transferring us back and forth to get the whole process sorted out.  We had to pay someone $50 to come out and measure the hole in the wall that was already there. We were able to go out and buy the AC unit from another retailer as per Sears' communications, but this created a lot of confusion for the installation process. At once point, the Sears representative was confused about "how does Sears get paid to install someone else's equipment"? Well, that is what the fees for installation were for :-)  Overall, it took extended effort to get the people of Sears to understand what we were asking for, but eventually they came through. The unit was installed for thousands less than anywhere else, but the value came at the price of aggravation for having to deal with the people on the phone...

Pricey, but that is what you get for good food at a classy establishment. Good for happy hour specials.

Cheap hotel on the strip with an embarrassing atmosphere (circus? really?). Wi-fi in the room did not work, bathroom was sub-par compared to other hotels on the strip, but the beds were clean. The pool was warm (gross-warm), crowded, cloudy, and had an odd odor to it.  The room keys were a joke. They worked for about half a day, then gradually required more and more swipes in order to enter the room. Turns out the magnetic strips were very weak and lost their coding pretty fast. We had to wait in line at customer service for 30+ minutes to get them recoded. Worked very well for the first half day again, but then suffered the same issue again. There were also a handful of people that had the same issue. I guess they are aware of this issue so they have a dedicated recoding line at the front desk, but that is not really resolving the issue.

One of the cheapest hotels on the strip. Not very glamorous but it was centrally located on the strip and had cheap drinks and food. The room was pretty clean and came with free wifi and a fridge. Other hotels on the strip cost twice as much and don't come with wifi or a fridge. Perfect for a low-budget weekend trip.

Went for a D-backs game and was pleased with the overall experience. The place looked pretty clean and there were some good deals for food, albeit at baseball field prices!

Bento boxes and sushi rolls are a must. Won-ton soup is a bit on the salty side. Be sure to ask for extra fruit snacks for your after-dinner pleasure!

Burgers were well-crafted and cooked to perfection. The Cap'n Crunch milkshake brought back childhood memories, but was very chunky as a milkshake. They literally added cereal and blended it half-way. If it were a smoother consistency, I would have given this place a 5-start rating.

We only came for the lunch buffet. Wow! Food was incredible and held us over for the rest of the night (I'm not kidding). Free mimosa's and a 2-hour seating limit (it was labor day weekend so it was very very crowded). A fair price for the quality/quantity of food.

50% off sales every other Saturday. Gets a bit crowded during sales, but everything is reasonably priced and some things are pretty good quality. Get there when it opens if you want the best stuff as things move quickly!

Ordered a french dip sandwich with fries. The fries were excellent and crispy, but the sandwich could have been a little bigger. Overall, it had a nice atmosphere and the value was average.

This is a go-to spot whenever I have family visiting. The food is unique and always delicious. The portions are just right and all entrees are ~$10. The desserts are a little pricey ($6-8) but are excellent if you want to splurge! Good beer selection as well.

Ideal hang-out for happy hour. Nice beer selection and the wings are incredible. We had a big group of people, so we ordered each flavor of wings. I can attest that each one is well deserving of praise.  Casual atmosphere and reasonable prices makes this place an excellent choice to kick back, relax, and enjoy some food!

Fries and a 3x3 make for a perfect square meal. The milkshakes take some serious suction to get through a straw, but get better as they melt a bit.

Surprisingly small, but they were able to accommodate a group of 10 luckily (we took up the majority of the floor space). The lunch buffet had limited options, but bottomless jerk chicken, coconut tilapia, and rice were out of this world. I only had lunch, but I would guess that lunch would be better than dinner.

Used to live here when it was owned by a different company. They used to have weekly wine & cheese nights hosted at the clubhouse and most people in the office were very friendly. The community was very outgoing and many of us are still good friends even though we moved out (bought a house).  Since we left, the property has been under new ownership and I've heard some negative things about. Hopefully they will bring back the weekly wine nights. In general, the new staff does not seem as warm and welcoming as the old staff.  Amenities are nice and they offer fully furnished apartments. The option for a garage was also a big plus for us!  Don't pay your rent with your credit card unless you want a $25 service fee. Paying with a direct deposit from your bank account is free :-)

Boneless Thursdays are really my only excuse to come here. The wings can be hit-or-miss sometimes regarding moisture content and sauciness, but are tastey regardless.

Yes. The Kobe burger is honestly the best burger I have ever had, and I have had a lot of good burgers! If you want to experience something truly wonderful in Vegas, order the Kobe burger!

Very happy with this grocery store. Reminded me a lot of Publix (FL) in terms of kind staff, pleasant atmosphere, and great sales.

I've only had good experiences with Leslie's and their staff. They taught me how to properly maintain my pool and I rarely need to maintain it anymore quite honestly. People compliment the water quality/clarity of my pool whenever they are over. That is why Leslie's has earned my business over-and-over again.  They also offer free vacuum repair service, you pay for the parts. They will also disassemble and let you keep the old parts that are still good if you opt for a new vacuum.

This is my go-to spot for brunch. Tastey, fresh mimosa's and eggs benedict made to perfection. It is obviously a popular establishment as it is fully booked every time I have been there!

Every visit to Vegas must include this buffet. Lunch or dinner, expect to surprise yourself with 2 hours of gourmet food and drink. Our lunch included bottomless mimosa's which was a nice touch. Went a second time for dinner and was also very satisfied. Line can get long (1hr wait or so), so go during off-peak hours.  Beware of requesting a small plate of crab legs though; they will ignore your request and pile on about 15-20 legs.

Probably the most intense workout I have ever had. The trainer kept everyone in check and was helpful to understand proper technique for all exercises. He was very motivating and kept the energy up. It was interesting to see a breakdown of all of the exercise statistics afterwards.

Ordered the pretzel basket as an appetizer prior to watching the D-back at Chase Field. For $8, we got four little pretzel bites. We would have been better off buying a full pretzel at Chase field as it was cheaper there!

Found this company on YouTube of all places. I called Ron to have my torsion springs replaced and he was able to give me a quote immediately and came out the next day. He was very honest and suggested that I replace my rollers as well since he noticed my door was Very loud and rickety during operation. He was able to fix my garage and now it is surprisingly quiet and smooth. It is hard to impress me with good repair work, but every time I open my garage I am very happy with the quality of work that I received as well as the price.  I would highly recommend this company for its great value, speed of service, and quality of repair.

Clean, large, and comforable. Klipsh surround sound is high quality. Parking is awful almost any time of day, so be prepared to work up a sweat walking!  Having lots of restaurants nearby makes this a great venue for date-night or a night out with friends!
