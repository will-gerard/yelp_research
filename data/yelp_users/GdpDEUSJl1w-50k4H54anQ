Was very impressed with the Level of customer service at this place. Most Asian restaurant, though very tasty food, usually lack warmth and customer service; not this place.  The owner walks around and know most of his clients by name! Sharing stories and giving and receving hugs.  In top of that they provide a complimentary pot of tea as you sit down.  This experience might just make me a regular here!

Tasty drinks but that's about it. Waiters, bartenders and even managers are not only incompetent but quite rude also.   Yesterday I set up a poetry set to showcase a few local Phoenix artist. I had told the management on multiple occasions what we where going to be doing and the nature of our show. We had the spot reserved for over a month and a half! Not only where they not ready (understaffed and one of their bars closed) but once our audience started showing up (most of color), all of a sudden there was a problem with our show.   What makes the whole situation worse is that the place was DEAD, maybe 10 people at most. My group had about 50 people with another 40 expected to show up. All ordering drinks and food. But the owner Steve still decided to kick us out because we where going to "offend" his clientele. The same clients that were coming up to me and my group wanting to take pictures with us, some even asking to buy tickets to the event. The shirts that Steve claimed to be offensive to his clients where all BOUGHT from us by his clients at the place. Some even going as far as buying the shirts off our back Literally!   As a successful Real Estate Investor it is obvious to me that this place does not know how to run a business. And further more this place is willing to give up a very profitable night turning away close to 100 customers willing to consume food and drinks, just because we look different than their normal audience.

I love this place,  it's cool,  upscale and very modern.  In addition to the great food and drinks the bartender is the best bartender I have ever incountered.  Honestly I had been there once or twice and didn't get a chance to back for a few Months and when i did he not only remembered my name but he remembered my drink and what I ate

One of the worst Chinese Buffets I have ever been to. Everything looked like it had been sitting for hours upon hours.  I never judge on looks alone, so I tried some of the food but it was disgusting. Even their deserts tasted like shit.  Not only will I never eat here again, but I would suggest you stay away also.  I just hope that my stomach doesn't pay for this later on tonight
