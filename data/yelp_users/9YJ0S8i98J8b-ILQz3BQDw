The people that work here are so F'n rude!! I used to come here when it was a Shell, still one of the same employees, but for the most part, still rude.  I will now seek a gas station owned by AMERICANS if such a thing still exists

Always love a place that has consistent food quality, and an exceptional staff! I have a few favorite items, and generally stick with them, but when I decide to go outside the box, I'm never disappointed with the food!  Keep up the great work!!

The lady working the drive thru was friendly, however there was only one car in front of me, and it didn't look like they ordered $200 worth of food, but it took over 10 minutes when they pulled up to the window!! Of course my 3 soft tacos were ready and I was able to pay and leave, but the service is SO SLOW!!! And it seems like they close earlier than the times posted on the window some nights.  If you're craving Taco Bell, do yourself a favor and go to the one on Alma School & Warner!! The drive thru window is a little awkwardly set back, but they are quick and the food is always good and correct!!

I have been coming to this particular location for years,  I have never picked up a bad pizza ever!  Being from Chicago, this is by far the best pizza I have found in AZ!! I've been to a few other locations and they were okay, but the Warner and McClintock location is the best! The girls are always polite on the phone, and everyone is friendly when I walk in.  I would recommend this location if you want a great pie!!

First time here today, went there for take out, there was no minimum order required.  I had the black pepper beef.  It was really good, better than I had expected.  This will be my new place for Chinese food!! The lady working the counter was real nice and helpful pick out something.  Keep up the good work!!

I only gave a second star because the side of Mac n cheese I ordered was good, they do however have the slowest drive thru on the planet.

I have been going here for years, Rita is the best, and makes a killer hoagie!! No matter what sandwich I get, it's always perfect.  I usually order take out and never have to wait very long.  Thank you for keeping it consistent and always delicious!!

I was in the market for a new place to tan since the place I used to go had recently closed.  I was impressed with the whole facility,; including the girl that was working the counter, she was super friendly and gave me a full tour of the place.  I had no idea that I was going to receive a free tan on my first visit, that was a nice surprise!! The prices are very reasonable considering the high end beds they have.  I will definitely be going back, and recommend Club Tan to my friends.

Today was my first time at Jimmy's,  I placed an order for a combo sandwich to go.  It wasn't what I'm used to being from Chicago,  however it wasn't terrible.  I'm used to the beef being shaved,, much thinner than I was served, the sausage was really good, overall sandwich was dry.  The fries were cooked perfect and the giardiniera was better than most I've had in AZ.   I will most likely be back to try something different next time.

I just want to say thank you to Tony and his staff for helping me out with the front alignment today!  This place is a little hard to find, but well worth it.  Everyone I spoke with was very courteous and knowledgeable about the issues I was having. Thanks again, and if I need any repairs in the future, I will be back, and will for sure recommend Oasis to any of my friends or family that need work done on their cars.

Just found this place today, I was told it had been there for five years, and is currently under new management.  The food was really good, it reminded me of a Chinese place I used to frequent in Chicago.  Best part is they deliver within a 5 mile radius, so the next time will be delivery! I would recommend this place to anyone in the area

Two stars was gracious after the experience I just had in the office.  We received a phone call about our dog needing to be on a leash at all times, completely understandable.  However the woman that called was the district manager and was very rude and snappy over the phone.  When I made mention of that today to the community manager, I was told that she had every right to be like that??? WTH??? There are plenty of ways of getting a point across without being rude.  I'm embarrassed to have people over the way the people downstairs from me have their place looking, broken screens, many blinds missing from their windows.  Today is the day I regret moving here.  Cannot wait until my lease is up!!

First time at Mikes, I ordered a beef cheesesteak sandwich & a drink, since it was my first time, my soda was free!! My sandwich was worth every penny!! I have that feeling of being full, but can't stop eating cause my sandwich is so good!! Keep up the amazing food! I will be back to try new things and have some ice cream too!

I haven't seen a Quiznos in quite some time, they've all closed in my area.  I was driving by and saw this location and it was OPEN!! I was so excited I made a u turn and pulled right up to it.  I ordered my old favorite... Classic Italian, and it was just as good as I remembered it to be!  The guys working the counter were so polite and friendly, that alone will keep me coming back.  I hope this location succeeds, I know I will definitely be a regular customer here.

Being from Chicago, this is the only place around to get a really good beef sandwich! I'm so glad they decided to open here in AZ! Food is always excellent, and the service is always great as well.  Keep up the good work "Team Portillo's"!!
