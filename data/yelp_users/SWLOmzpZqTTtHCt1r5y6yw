I am so glad I found this place! Inexpensive and awesome:) my nail lady, My (pronounced "Me") was fabulous! Made me feel comfortable and relaxed. I got my nails done, full set acrylic with gel polish, and my eye brows waxed. She gave me 10% student/first timer discount! She talked to me about the facials they offer and I am definitely going to go back and get one asap. She was kind and very informative and didn't pressure me into getting things I didn't want (design or pedicure). I will be going to her from now on!

Besides the fact that they are ALWAYS on a wait and busy, this place is great. Good food, awesome atmosphere, great staff. I love the Peach ale and pasta salad.

Our room wasn't ready for check in around 1pm on a Saturday (Memorial Day weekend) no biggie, so we got our pool passes and headed down to the pool area. First off, they told us they didn't know when our room would be ready and told us to just come back and ask every so often. Once we got down to the pool area, they were extremely rude to us upon entry. I had a coffee from the Starbucks IN THEIR LOBBY and they made me throw it away. They checked our bags and told us we weren't allowed to take anything in. We explained that our room wasn't ready and that we did not want to leave all of our stuff in our hot cars. They rudely told us that they could keep it up front in the storage room while we wait. We had a 2 year old little one with us who has a gluten allergy and needed his specific snacks and drinks and they told us we could not bring it in. I get there is hotel policy but at least be respectful and nice to your guests. We had cockroaches in our room. Today when we went down to the pool before checkout I noticed so many people walking around with Starbucks drinks in the pool area. Inconsistency with the rules! We also tried to do a late checkout and were denied. Even though it says in your room that for an additional fee you can order a late check out. WILL NOT be going back. All these little inconsistency's and rudeness has lost them at least 6 customers. We've all worked in the food and beverage industry too and we understand the stress it is on a holiday weekend but come on people just be polite to your guests!

Bad service, no drink menu, servers knew nothing about any specials going on or bar knowledge. Horrible. Decent food for their cheap pricing.
