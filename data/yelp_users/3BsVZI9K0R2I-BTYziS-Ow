Worst Chicken Parm ever (including frozen meals) but very good pizza.  I give it 2 stars. If you are an Italian place it is not acceptable to have terrible Chicken Parm...Sorry

Is this a joke? I literally eat the single worst shrimp scampi dish I have ever had in my life. I then asked for a pasta dish with chicken. The sauce was terrible and the chicken was very rough. In addition the pasta was still a bit undercooked. Awful.

I have been forced to come here many times as I am part of a networking group that meets here. I have been to a LOT of establishments in the valley. In regards to how the food tastes....this among the worst tasting food in Chandler. Awful awful awful food!

I have been to probably 40-50 different restaurants in Arizona. There is no place that even comes close to how awful the food is at this place. I understand it might be a cool spot to hang out at and maybe they have some good margaritas but you really cannot find a place that has worse food. DISGUSTING!

This review is based on my experience last year. I came across this and saw all the good reviews and I felt compelled to write this. The food here is disgusting and so is the way it is prepared. Maybe this is an east coast thing but shrimps pass waste (you know a #2). When this happens your not supposed to leave all the poop on the shrimp. Every piece of shrimp served was served in its' own poop and hard as a ROCK. I have never had any seafood dish that was nearly as bad as the one I had here. Its also nasty not to clean out the shrimp. I honestly can't understand how anyone could possibly give this place more than 2 stars. What are you people thinking? BTW I was also served the worst tasting noodles I have ever ordered at ANY Asian establishment. How in earth do any of you give this place good reviews???

I find it very sad that this place does not get busier because the food here is ALWAYS outstanding. I think they need a better location. I come from NY so I really dislike most of the places in Phoenix. Compare the food in NY and AZ and you will understand why I say that. Excellent food and excellent service. This has been a consistent experience for my wife and I all 3 times we have gone there

I have been to close to 10 self-serve yogurt places in the valley and I am very critical. The reason I give this 5 stars is because:  A. Most creative and best tasting flavors by far (I have tried a bunch of places) B. Cheapest prices  C. Free Water  What else do you need?

The yogurt was good but the owner is a weirdo. My wife and I went there and asked if they had any sample cups. Bear in mind EVERY self-serve frozen yogurt place offers sample cups. My wife said "Excuse me sir do you have any sample cups" His response was "you want sample cups" and it was obvious by his response he was unhappy ven asked for it and literally stared us down cold the entire time and only gave us 1 cup (for both of us combined). It was really awkward. Sorry sir but you own a self-serve yogurt place. If you really think asking for  sample cups is rude and warrants a 3 minute death stare you have some issues.

I have been to Nando's twice. Nando's is beautiful inside and the staff is great but the food leaves much to be desired. We tried multiple dishes and all were either flavorless and/or sloppy looking.   They also don't menton their signature Apple Burro has a terrible texture and is filled with apple filling from the can. I am not trying to be rude but they really need to improve the food.

Bonnie Moehle taught me how to get out of my own way and has helped me with "rewiring my mental hard drive" so I could get further faster and enjoy life more. Before I started working with Bonnie I was getting in the way of furthering my own success and she helped me understand how changing a few simple changes could alter my life. Although I have my own occasional demons and problems like many people do she has made a very positive impact on my life and I am in a much better spot because of her coaching. If you want to change anything in your life whether it is making more money, loving yourself more, career advancement, or even fighting any fears or demons I feel very confident in telling you Bonnie is an amazing coach and can likely help you as long as you remain open minded to her teachings and are willing to learn!

I think it's a travesty this place only has 3.5 stars. This is the best Asian fusion food I have had anywhere in AZ. I am very critical in my reviews of restaurants. P.F. Changs has always been my favorite Asian restaurant but I can honestly say the food here is better. Our waiter and our bartender were very friendly as well. There was not one thing I didn't like about this place, which is very very rare. If you give this place 3 stars or less you simply need to stop eating out.
