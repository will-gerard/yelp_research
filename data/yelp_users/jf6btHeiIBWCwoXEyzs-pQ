I went to this salon for a 50 minute full custom facial. What I got was 25 minutes of steam in my face in a loud salon. My appointment was at 1:00 and, at 1:05 I met Dunia, who would be doing my facial. What happened in the next 25 minutes was this: a quick cleansing of my face, some gritty stuff applied and steam in my face for about 15 minutes, a bright light in my face without my eyes covered and a rough rinse off of my face, some really strong (she said it was antiseptic to "kill bacteria") stuff applied to my face, followed by sunscreen ... that was it. Oh - and all of this WITH THE DOOR OPEN ... and let me just say it was not quiet in this place (aka: NOT relaxing). I walked out of the salon at 1:30 wishing I hadn't wasted my time and money for something I could have done myself at home.

I had my first laser hair removal session here. I am doing my full legs. Price was reasonable ($99 for entire leg). The estethecian, Holly, did a great job, explaining everything as as she went along. The office was clean and everyone was very professional. I would recommend Body Solutions to anyone looking for a virtually painless laser experience.

My husband and I have been here several times and have not once had anything less than amazing service and excellent food. Friendly, accommodating staff makes the evening a little extra special. The atmosphere is quiet, romantic and perfect for a date night or special celebration.

Love the veggie burger and sweet potato waffle fries! My husband and I often go to the spa at The Phoenician and then walk across the street to Relish for lunch. Excellent service and friendly and accommodating staff keep us coming back!

I was using a Groupon that was $21 for an express mani-pedi (normal price is $42 for this service). I wasn't expecting a full spa mani-pedi since it was called "express" but I sure didn't complain! I made an appointment and got in right away. The nail tech was great and the extra long leg massage was fabulous! Beautiful place that opened in mid-January. Definitely will be returning here.

If you're looking for a Mastros in the heart of Arcadia, Steak 44 isn't it. Although it's owned by Mastros, it's not the same experience as the original Mastros. The food was just ok and the choices were limited. Disappointed the pretzel bread - a Mastros classic - was not served. Lack of entertainment in the bar was another disappointment. Our waitress, Marina, was very attentive and helpful. Unfortunately, mid-way into our meal she announced she was being sent home as it was slow. The waitress who took over wasn't very personable, didn't offer a dessert menu (we had to ask) and we had to flag her down to get her to take our credit card. My husband and I left underwhelmed. Definitely worth the drive to the original Mastros or Dominick's Steakhouse (another Mastros owned restaurant).

There's a girl at my gym who has beautiful lashes ... One day after class I decided to ask her about them. She said she has been going to Liz, the owner of Skin Frenzy, for lash extensions for several years. She highly recommended Liz (and pretty much gave me her personal guarantee that I would not be disappointed!) I messaged Liz through her website and she called me back that same day and I set an appointment for the initial lash application. From the first look in the mirror with my new lash extensions, I knew I would never want to be without them! Liz is personable and friendly and does beautiful work in a professional, comfortable environment. If you want the best of the best for lash extensions, you have to call Liz!

I've been to the Scottsdale location several times, as well as the original location on Maui. The taco mountain - with ono and mahi - is my favorite. Great place for lunch, but go early as it gets busy!

I really wanted to like this place! It's why my husband and I have been here 3-4 times in the last several months since discovering it. I love the veggie burger! A non-bean based burger made with rice, potatoes, carrots and spinach. It's light and delicious! My husband loves the Chicago dog and onion rings. The ice cream is great too! These are the reasons we kept going back. The thing is, EVERY TIME we have been there, something was wrong! The food never comes out all at once - one time we sat for 15 minutes after finishing our burgers before the onion rings arrived and having had to ask for them on more than one occasion. Extras I ordered on my veggie burger were missing. The soap in the restroom is empty (I hate the wash/dry sink combo but I get they're trying to be environmentally friendly). The ketchup is always empty. Today, however, was the last straw and we will never go back. One of the employees - a girl with long, dark hair - was brushing her hair at the counter where the ice cream is made/served. Ummm .. seriously GROSS! Later, this same girl was behind the window where the food was being made and I saw her run her fingers through her hair. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. I told my husband he needs to contact the owner because even though we will never return, that's just disgusting and completely unacceptable!
