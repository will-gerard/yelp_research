Been coming here for a while, almost every Monday. The staff are always friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfy. The smoking outside is sometimes overwhelming--and one has to walk through it to get to the bathrooms. I enjoy the food and the coffee is really good.

I really love the coffee and the food here. The atmosphere is good too. Sometimes annoyed when I'm working on something or in conversation and suddenly someone decides to play the piano really loudly (I should enjoy the music, but sadly I find it disruptive and annoying during the day). The worst part--THE FLIES!!!! Omg, they need to do something about the constancy of the flies!!!!

Really good, high quality food. A little pricey, but very typical of such high quality vegetarian food. I will be a fairly regular customer.

I feel like they're trying to compete with McDonald's or something with the new menu. The burgers are thin, full of mostly bread, and have too much sauce. I'm afraid the changes are not a move in a good direction. The Green Burger was good, healthy, and loved. Why get rid of it? I'm sad as I'm going to miss this place. Just can't eat this stuff anymore. :-(

I tried it again, trying to see if anything positive had changed in the months since I had been here last. I tried the Calexico burger. Again, terribly thin, seemingly artificially processed patties (though there was two) slathered in sauce and a bun. No texture, just a mushy mess. Three redeeming values remain: the thyme fries are amazing, they remember your name and seem to have stepped up customer service and attention, and the Tsoynamis are delicious. I'm afraid this is the last lunch I will be enjoying here unless I hear they decide to stop competing with is loosely termed "food" at McDonald's.

I have lunch here nearly every Tuesday. The staff are always friendly and Einsteins always has good food. It's a great place to meet people and talk. The patio is great, except in really hot or humid weather, which doesn't happen often (gotta love AZ weather!).

Sasha and the crew have done an amazing job with the new place, and the food just amazing as it was at the previous location. I'm excited for them and I'm excited to have 24 Carrots closer to my work. Thank you Sasha, Amanda, and all the rest of the crew (both new and continuing).
