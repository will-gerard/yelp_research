Weekly brunch #4 brought my friend and me to Mimi's Cafe today.  First off, let me say it is SO cute!  It's got this French sort of theme going on, and upon walking in, you feel a little Euro flair.  It was kind of strange because there wasn't really a hostess, so people were just kind of milling around the entryway, but someone would occasionally come by and seat people, so there wasn't really a wait.  The food options are really great here, and they have a seasonal menu from which I ordered the pumpkin pancakes.  I recommend.  They come topped with caramelized cinnamon apples.  My friend got the blueberry stuffed French toast, which is French toast stuffed with blueberry cream cheese and topped with some other fruit stuff, and he said it was really good, too.  Per tradition, my friend also ordered a side of potatoes, and what we liked about these potatoes was that they weren't hashed.  They were diced red potatoes, and they were seasoned so that you didn't even need any ketchup.  They were soft where they needed to be and crispy in just the right places.  We ranked the potatoes in the top two on the list of Best Brunch Potatoes.    What's nice about Mimi's Cafe: 1. Jamie, our waitress, was super friendly and super speedy at coming around to top off our coffees (sidenote: the coffee, depending on what batch you get, might be a bit watered down). 2. If you get the breakfast (with a side of eggs and either bacon or sausage) and don't go a la carte, you also get a glass of juice with the meal as part of the breakfast. 3. The ambience is really cute and comfortable and family-friendly.  It's a place I would like to take my older parents when they come to visit.   4. Prices are great especially if you decide to go with the full breakfast option.  There WAS a little mix up at the end with my credit card not being returned to me when I paid, but when I brought it up to the restaurant people, they quickly apologized and was able to find it and return it to me.  People make mistakes, so I won't count the incident against them.  Also something to note: I'm not sure how crowded they get during peak hours, but my friend and I went around 10:30, which was a great time to go.  The restaurant itself wasn't totally packed, even though the parking lot would make you think otherwise.  That parking lot was kind of small, but it's not a deal-breaker, especially cuz there's a ton of parking across the street on the mall side if you're willing to walk (I, apparently, was not).

So I finally took the plunge to change my insurance to AZ, so I decided I might as well take advantage of paying more by getting the mysterious scratch that ran along the entire driver's side of my car fixed.  I've had this exact same problem before (which makes me wonder if someone is after me), so I knew the protocol: call Geico, find a repair shop that's Geico-affiliated, get a rental.  My last experience dealing with this scratch business was really easy, and this time was no different.  I'm not sure how Geico decides what repair shops to work with, but the checklist must go something like this:  -Friendly employees - check. -Clean facilities - check. -Geico Adjuster on location to explain everything to you in layman's terms honestly - check. -Enterprise Rent-A-Car on location with a car ready and waiting - check. -Cute boys working at Enterprise - check. -Fastest turn-around time ever - check. -Great communication skills with phone calls and updates - check. -Free bottles of water - check. -Can provide a painless experience to the customer - check.  Not to mention, when I got there, the adjuster looked over my car and thought I could get away with just getting it buffed so I wouldn't have to pay.  Even though that wasn't the case, it was nice that he tried to save me from paying my deductible.  So, long story short, if you need some repair work done on your vehicle, Gerber is the place to go.  They treat your car like a baby.  Perhaps that is why it is called Gerber.  Hm...

If you're from the Chicago area, you'll be glad to finally see a Sonic and not just see the commercial for it!  I just HAD to go when I moved here, and it's so worth it.  I haven't tried any food, but the slushes are the best because they're so fresh AND refreshing.  They put whole chunks of fruit in them (what fast food place does that?), and if you go between 2-4PM any day, the drinks are all half off.  Drive-thru and drink up!

I always wonder why there are few cars in the parking lot of this restaurant whenever I drive by because this place is pretty good!  They have a menu with great variety, and for those of you unsure about Indian food, no worries.  The menu describes what's in each dish.  The portions are pretty decent as is the price.  The naan is huge, but a little crispier than I'm used to having it back in Chicago.  The mango lassi was also a little less dense than I prefer, but it still tasted awesome and was quite refreshing in this heat.  The owners appear to be kind of mom-and-pop-ish, and they're really nice, too.  I'll probably be back.  Warning: If you make your food spicy, even if you think you can handle spicy, it's gonna be spicier than you think.

When I had only three days to figure out where I was living in Arizona from Chicago and after a disastrous ordeal trying to sign a lease with Sun River Apartments (do NOT go with Sun River), the girls at Willow Creek were sooo helpful, I literally almost started crying at their compassion and willingness to help me.  There is always at least two or three people in the office at any given time, so there is never a shortage of people to help you, and I never feel like I am being rushed so that they can help the next person.  Not only are the front staff great, but the maintenance guys are great, too.  They are pretty quick to get around to any maintenance requests you might have, and they're really friendly.  Each apartment unit here has a washer/dryer in the unit, so that's a major bonus.  Each unit also has a dishwasher, an outdoor storage unit, and a covered parking spot, which is key in this hot Arizona weather.  The complex has a 24-hour gym, which is kind of small, but I never feel like it's crowded when I go, and I go almost daily.  There's probably only one or two other people in there at any given time, IF that.  The gym key is a one-time $50 fee, but when you return the key, you'll get $25 back, so it's really like you're paying a $25 deposit and $25 actual fee.  There are also 3 different pools here.  The front one near the office is heated and has a hot tub as well, but in the summer months, it doesn't really matter which pool you go in because they all feel nice.  I know that there is also a newly renovated recreation center, but I have yet to go in it.  Everytime there is a Willow Creek party (yes, they do those here, which I hear are pretty awesome), I am out of town!!  One day, though, I WILL see the rec center.  The clubhouse is pretty sweet, too.    In addition, I find that the rent here is pretty decent.  I have a one-bedroom that I pay around $580 for, and a friend who just moved into her own one-bedroom is paying around $650 (different floorplans).  Pets are also allowed, but since I don't have one, I can't tell you how much the fees are for them.  Sorry!  Added perks: For those of you who are Earth-lovers like I am, you'll be pleased to know that Willow Creek is one of few apartment complexes around here that have recycling available for the residents.  Another added perk is that each resident gets one free car wash per month paid for by Willow Creek and provided for by one of the residents.  The residents, btw, are mostly pretty cool.  There usually isn't a ton of noise, and there's a good mix of families, couples, single-working folks, and students (who aren't really the partying type since this complex is a little farther than others).  The complex is also right on a bus route and also near the free Orbit shuttle, so make use of the public transportation system!!    I got so lucky finding this place.  I didn't even get a chance to see the place in-person, but I think things happen for a reason, and I'm glad they worked out the way they did.  I have at least another year here in Arizona, and I intend to stay at Willow Creek during that time.  Wouldn't want to be anywhere else!!  Note: If you're looking for a place with a security gate, this isn't it.  At the same time, though, it's relatively quiet around here with few major problems.  Hope we can become neighbors, fellow Yelp!-ers!  :)  Also note: The reason WC is getting four stars instead of five is simply cuz this place is no Trump Towers or penthouse on the Vegas strip.  Clearly, there can be other amenities added or features to increase the appeal to Willow Creek, but I'm a WAY bigger fan of Willow Creek in comparison to other apartments that my friends are living in.

Alright.  I used to love this place when I lived there, but as the years went on and new people started to show up for work in the leasing office, shit got cray, and I was over it.  Things got particularly bad when I moved out.    Prior to moving out, I spoke with two different people on two separate occasions regarding the paint on my walls.  What I did was have an accent wall painted in the living area and my bedroom.  I was told by these two folks that since I lived there for over 24 months, my repainting fee would be waived, and I wouldn't have to paint over it because they'd have to repaint anyways per their own two-year policy.  So, off I went to my next destination without a worry, fully expecting to receive a clean-out bill in the next couple of months with the repainting fee waived per my previous conversations with the staff.  Well, imagine my surprise when I got an email from "Maria" two months later with a request to pay the clean-out bill WITH repainting fee.  Almost immediately, I responded with an explanation of the situation and a request to waive the fee, as it shouldn't have been there in the first place.  Four days later, I get a response saying, "If you live in the apartment for 24 months or more you are not responsible for paint job but this does not include any accent walls."  Um...wtf?  How does it even make sense that the repainting fee is waived if all my walls were painted, but it'll cost money to repaint only two accent walls?    Again, I responded quick and got no response from Maria until two months later, when she emailed with a threatening document attached giving me my final notice to pay $180 and that if I don't pay it, my "account will be turned over to our collection agency at that time the amount will be increased by 50% to cover the collection costs, a judgment will be placed on your credit report and wages will be garnished.  Once this is on your credit, it will remain there for seven years, which will make it difficult to rent an apartment and/or purchase a home."    First off, no, Maria.  No.  Not cool.  Don't you be talking to me about a final notice.  I didn't even get a second or third notice.  Second, don't you be talking to me about a final notice, especially after I didn't get a second or third notice, and ESPECIALLY SINCE IT HAS BEEN FOUR MONTHS SINCE I MOVED OUT, which was enough time for me to move and become settled and start work in a new country.  Get your shit together.  Third, don't you dare threaten me and my amazing credit.  I've paid my rent early and/or on time every month that I lived there, so it's crazy of you to think I'd be delinquent in paying anything and, of all things, this ridiculous fee.  Fourth, let's talk about this ridiculous fee.  Your reasoning for the repainting fee is ridiculous, and your story doesn't match up with the other two people I talked to before I left, so no.  Just no.  After writing back to tell her I responded to her two months ago, Maria quickly realized her mistake and decided she would "be willing to take off the paint charge."  No.  It was an error on your company's part, so you really should be saying, "I apologize for the error and inconvenience, Ms. K.  Of course, I will remove the fee."  It's not REALLY my problem.  It's yours that became mine, isn't it?    So now, we've come to the point where I finally pay the remaining clean-out fee and ask for confirmation when she's gotten the electronic payment.  Three days later, no response.  So I write again letting her know that the payment should be there by now according to my bank; however, according to Maria, she still hasn't received it.  At that point, I just quit communicating with Willow Creek because it's just frustrating when I have to follow-up with them about money THEY want from ME.  I felt like I was reminding them to do their job.  In which case, I should've been the one to get paid.    Ugh.  NEVER AGAIN.  Even if the apartment itself was decent and the rent was super reasonable, the customer service and lack of communication among the staff was so terrible, I'd never want to live there again.  Yelpers, there are lots of other places to live in Tempe.  Go seek those places.

I love my fellow Yelp!-ers for helping me find Rambha aka the end of ripping my skin out for the sake of not looking like a mustached man with a uni-brow.  I never tried threading, but then again, I never lived in Tempe, so I thought, While I've got a trend of doing new things going on, why not try out this threading business?  Well, let me tell you: threading/Rambha is AWESOME.  It's such a strange feeling for first-timers, but it doesn't hurt, and it's so much less mess and less fuss than waxing.  I went to get my brows and upper lip threaded, and the result was a great look minus the pain, minus the remaining sticky residue, and plus the rest of my day to go out to enjoy instead of hiding out to shield society from having to be alarmed by my red, swollen face.     The only downside from my experience was that Rambha answered a phone call during my session and proceeded to converse for the next 5-10-ish minutes while leaving me to just hang out.  I thought that was kind of unprofessional, but it wasn't a deal breaker cuz I'll be back.  Plus, if going back means the possibility of seeing this guy I saw there in his two-sided puss n' boots t-shirt again, I'm so there.    Note: Rambha only takes cash or check, but she prefers cash (who doesn't?).  Once you enter the salon, be sure to walk down the hallway to the left because that's where Rambha's little section sits.  You can try to follow the instructions upon walking into the salon by using the electronic registering service, but I did, and it did nothing.  I just waited until Rambha came out to get coffee and just happened to ask if I was waiting for something.  If you want some prices for threading, here you go: Eyebrows: $12 Upper Lip: $8 Forehead: $5 Chin: $8 Side: $10 Full Face: $40

On my second official weekly brunch with my friend, we decided to hit The Breakfast Club up, and I really liked this place for Sunday brunch.  We had to wait for a little while, but it wasn't any more than I would expect to wait for a popular brunch spot.  We had the option to sit in or outside, and though we said the fastest seat was ok, we were secretly hoping to sit inside.  Lucky for us, our wish was granted and was seated inside.    My friend ordered the cinnamon challah french toast, which looked AMAZING.  It came topped with candied nuts, seasonal berries, and Vermont maple syrup.  I ordered the BC burro, which was egg, ham, cheese, and green pepper wrapped in a tortilla with a side of hashed browns.  Let me just tell you, BC knows how to do their hashed browns right!  Perfectly browned but not burnt.  The burro was pretty darn good, too, and came with a side of salsa, but I personally liked it better topped with ketchup.  Let me also state here that the burro was totally cheap: about five bucks.  The french toast was not as cheap, but it also was not any more expensive than other brunch places.  The coffee we ordered was awesome because it came hot and strong, which is perfect for a lazy Sunday morning, and the waitress was quick to come around with refills, too.    The reason I'm not giving this place a perfect five is for two reasons.  The first is that the waitress came back with a side of bacon for my friend, which he did not order.  It wasn't a big deal, but he doesn't eat meat, so it was gross for him, and he had ordered hashed browns, so technically, the order came out wrong.  The bigger issue was that about 80% of the way through eating his huge portion of french toast, my friend discovered a hair in it.  Lucky for the staff, my friend is not grossed out by hair found in food and just removed it, then continued to finish his meal with the idea that if he HAD eaten it, it'd have been considered more protein, but for normal people, finding a piece of hair in food is a deal-breaker, so I thought I'd mention it.  My food was fine, though, and it was good, so you go and make your own judgment call.  Oh, and I might also forewarn any of you who decide to go here that the parking situation is kind of crappy.  Just so you know.

Although the atmosphere here is quaint with its live mariachi band, the guy with the rose bucket coming around, and the dim lighting, the food is just...meh.  I went here on the recommendation of a friend I was with and had brought some out-of-town guests here for dinner one night, and I kind of wish I hadn't.  First off, I walk in, and the hostess asks how many people are in my party, so I tell her four, and she says to hold on and leaves.  I thought maybe she was getting menus or whatever, but no.  I'm waiting and waiting, and then, I look over and see her standing at a different hostess desk.  Um...hello.  I thought you were getting me a table.  I'm not really sure what her purpose was cuz the entrance was getting full, and she just stood there.  Finally, an older manager-ish man came out, saw the people, and got another girl to start seating people.    Once seated, I started to peruse the menu.  There was some Los Olivos special on there, and I was really confused by it because it was really a sour cream-filled enchilada with some cheese on top for $11.  Really?  I could make that myself for roughly $4.  I ended up getting a combination of 1 chicken and 1 beef enchilada, but I couldn't really tell the difference when it came out since it was all kind of hidden under a ton of melted cheese.  When a stranger at the next table asked what was good here, one of my out-of-town guests was like, It doesn't really matter what you get if you get a special because it all kind of comes as one mess on a plate.  That might sound enticing to some of you out there, but I promise you, it's not messy in an awesome way.  It all had the same texture and taste, and I wasn't even sure what that texture and taste was really.  It was kind of awkward, actually.  Afterward, my friend who suggested the place was like, I swear it was better last time I came, but for some reason, it wasn't good today.  He even went so far to say that if he were a Yelp!er, he'd have given the place three stars.  I, however, am giving it two because, really, I've had much better Mexican food around these parts with better parking, better chips and dip, and better everything.  Kind of disappointed in you, Los Olivos.  PS: If you do decide to go here and try it out, know that they DO NOT split checks.

It's ironic that I would luv this brewery because I am not much of a drinker.  I think what I luv about this place is that they find a way to sneak the beer into food so that people who can't drink much but like to eat (like me) can still enjoy being there.  I also enjoy that Four Peaks is one of those laid back bars where the music isn't pounding so loud that you can't have a conversation with the people sitting right next to you.  There's good food, good staff, good service, good prices, and lots of outdoor seating, so this is a great place to go for a nice evening out with anyone.  I'm a foodie, so I want to take a minute to mention how good the food is here.   On my last trip, I ordered the grilled chicken beer bread, which is grilled chicken breast, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, green peppers, red onion, mozzarella and cucumber sauce rolled in beer bread with a side of french fries and had ice cream cake for dessert.  Everything came out promptly and was SO good.  I want to give a special shout-out to the french fries at Four Peaks cuz they are especially tasty.  I also want to mention the stout shake to all you dessert lovers (particularly MALT lovers).  This is an item I usually get at Four Peaks because it is sooo creamy and delicious.  It's basically a malt made with half an oatmeal stout beer topped with whipped cream and Oreo crumbs.  Beer AND ice cream?  Yes please!    For an older student in a college town full of younger students, Four Peaks is a breath of fresh air.  It's a place that would not find a home on Mill Ave, and for that, I am SO grateful.

My friend and I officially started our weekly brunch get-togethers, and the first stop was this cute cafe.  We didn't have to wait as long as I thought we would, so that was nice.  I ended up ordering a half order of biscuits and gravy with sausage links and two eggs.  Yum!  The portions are plenty big, but I ended up clearing my plate.  My friend got the hashed browns with blueberry pancakes, and I loved that when his order came, they added a mini pancake so as not to waste any batter.  How very opposite of wasteful!  He said his food was delicious as well.  The prices are not what you would expect, so no unpleasant surprises.  The waitress was good too and came back plenty of times to fill our coffees and water and ask how we were doing.  A few things to point out:  1. Be sure to look up once you get inside to see what the special is.  It's usually written above the bar area.   2. If you go looking for skillets (like i did), you will not find any here.  Don't be deterred, though.  The menu carries a good variety, and the food is awesome. 3. They do not do separate checks, so be sure to figure out your payment beforehand if you think you're gonna split a check between some friends. 4. A half order of biscuits and gravy is a lot if you have a normal-sized stomach, especially cuz their biscuits are rectangular in shape instead of round, so be forewarned.  Overall, great service, great food, great place.  Bon appetit!

I don't get this place.  I went the other night just for some appetizers and drinks, and though the food was decent (fried zucchini and mushrooms), the parking lot, service, music, and crowd sucked. Parking is a bitch if you're gonna try parking in the lot.  I'd just skip it and try to find some parking on the side streets.    Before my group of friends got there, two other guys in our group were at a table, and apparently, the moody waitress (brunette with her hair in a ponytail) kept trying to get them to leave.  Maybe she thought more people weren't going to show, but still...wait a few minutes, you know?  Then, when the rest of the group got there, we asked for menus, and she comes and literally threw them on the table without saying anything to us.  When she returned to the table, she only took drink orders and didn't ask us about food.  Before we could even say anything, she had left.  When she returned with drinks, I asked if there was a drink menu I could look at since I hadn't made up my mind about what I wanted yet, and without even looking at me, she just shook her head and started rattling off ALL the drinks in the bar in one breath, which wasn't really what I was asking for.  And once again, what about the freakin' food?!  Only when she returned a third time did she finally ask us about food.  Then, later on in the evening, she started to clear off the centerpieces even before we were done because, apparently, somebody wanted to get a head start on cleaning up so she could go home early.  Well, Moody Waitress DID end up leaving, but without telling us, so when a different waiter came to finish up our table, we were all a bit confused.    Meanwhile, my friends and I couldn't help but discuss the horrible music that was playing.  And the crowd there was...interesting.  I'm not sure how to describe them.  Go and see for yourself.  Or better yet...don't.  There are better places to go in the area.  Don't waste your time here.

I didn't really LOVE my experience here, but for those who enjoy creative and fusioned sushi or a good sushi happy hour, this is a great place to go.  The menu is pretty impressive with all sorts of sushi concoctions that I have never seen, but I like my sushi pretty standard and not too crazy, so I ordered (ironically) the Crazy Horse roll, which is tuna, yellowtail, and salmon rolled with avocado and topped with tobiko.  I don't have TOO much to complain about regarding the size of the rolls (they were decent) or the taste (it was ok considering this is tempe, arizona), but I think I was most turned off by the service and prices of the restaurant.  When my friends and I walked in, happy hour was happening, so it's understandable that the wait staff were busy, but come on.  Seat us already.  Or at least acknowledge us.  When we were finally seated, our waitress kept huffing and puffing while taking our order.  I understand she may have been having a bad day or have been stressed, but whatever.  Stay profesh.  Then, one of my friends orders the tempura mix, and when it came out, it was missing the prawns, so what happens?  The waitress brings out a single fried prawn on a plate...15 minutes later.  Um...no.  The age-dofu was also kind of meh.  On top of that, I was confused about who was actually serving our table because the girl wait staff kept tag-teaming our table with the guy wait staff, and even then, the service was not awesome.  The whole experience altogether just kind of totaled a bit too much for a sort of blah experience, so I'm pretty sure I'll be going elsewhere for sushi around these parts.

Best...hashed...browns...ever.  (and yes, it's hashED browns, folks.)  I have tried a new brunch place almost on a weekly basis since I moved here in August, and MBB wins the hashed browns contest hands down.  They're so perfectly and proportionately crispy and soft.  DELISH!  Do try!    I ordered the hog and chick kind of out of necessity since there wasn't a great variety of choices on the menu, but in the end, it didn't matter cuz it was delicious.  I think the thing about MBB is that everything on the small menu is probably awesome, which is why they can afford to keep the menu small.  A nice touch was that they carried the Sunday newspaper, which was perfect since we forgot ours that particular weekend, and that helped to pass the waiting time for our food (which was not bad at all.  maybe 15 minutes.).    For all you coffee lovers, the java here is pretty good as well.  In fact, the waitress told us that the owners of MBB just recently opened up a coffee shop somewhere locally, so I'll have to find out where and go.  I just hope I don't have to wait as long as I did to get into MBB to get some coffee.  Truthfully, it wasn't so bad waiting.  I think we only waited about a half hour.  The only downside to MBB is the small space!  You'd think they would want to expand a little, but mayhaps this is part of the allure for us MBB fans.  No pain, no gain.   Sidenote: Parking is not the BEST, but if you go early, you should be able to find a spot just fine.  ALSO, note that they do NOT split checks.  Good to know beforehand.

I LOVE this place!  While randomly driving through the Melrose District, I came upon this lovely treasure.  This place doesn't look like much from the outside, and you very well might drive right past, but look for it and go in!  Every room I walked into, there was another room to explore, and each room had a ton of different goods.    When you walk into this store, you might initially think the stuff is all junk, but it's not.  There's more quality products than junk here, and the prices are usually right.  I ended up exploring for two hours here and then bought a red dresser that probably couldn't be found anywhere else for $45.  The man working there was nice enough to bring the dresser outside by my car and also offered to load it for me.  I plan to return again and again to furnish my new apt, and I can't wait!  Be forewarned though: All sales are FINAL. (though i can't imagine you'd want to return anything you bought here!)

SO full of great outdoor furnishings and accessories!!  If you want to give your outdoor space a more whimsical feeling (or just want to explore a fun store), Figs is the way to go.  They have all sorts of decorations to give your outdoor space a personal touch.  They also have some pieces of furniture that I wouldn't mind using indoors.    Another plus here are the owners.  They were really non-aggressive and just welcomed me to the store saying, Enjoy the store!  I like when I can just browse around and not feel like I'm being pressured to get something.  As far as price is concerned, some people might think certain items are a bit pricey, but I wasn't really surprised.  I found the prices pretty standard for stores in the Melrose district.  Go check it out!

Ask any of my friends, and they'll all tell you that I really hate movie theaters.  Maybe it's having to hear people rustling their bags of candy or see them shoving popcorn into their faces as if their lives depended on it.  Maybe it's that I don't have the luxury of rewinding if I couldn't catch what someone said in the movie.  Or maybe I just don't want to pay $10 to see some Hollywood movie that will most likely be bad than good when I could pay $9 for a month of Netflix and just wait for that craptastic movie to come out on dvd.  My disdain for most movie theaters is almost that of hate, but I LOVE movie theaters like Valley Art.    Valley Art has only one screen (the last of its kind in the valley), and they show movies that are lesser known than the Hollywood box office hits.  Mostly, they show independent, foreign, historic, or artistic movies, which brings in a different kind of audience than other theaters.  There is a historic feel to this theater with its one concession stand, one ticket booth, and one screen.  Even the outside decor is reminiscent of times past, and I have no qualms about supporting this kind of theater.

Holy cow, I love this place!  It's a little difficult to find cuz it sits on a random corner, but you can find it by the colorful display in the windows.  Michael Todd's has such friendly staff and really great furnishings for really great prices.  I am currently in the market for an armchair, which I saw here back in December that I didn't get cuz I just can't buy furniture without having to think about it for a few weeks.  (it's a problem.  i'm aware.)  When I went back there today, as expected, the chair was no longer around, so I asked the staff about it.  They were quick to know which armchair I was asking about, and they said they would look into getting more.  Awesome!    The prices here are really awesome, too.  For example, that chair that I'm interested in?  With tax included, the price would have been $248.  Nice.  Aside from furniture, they also have artwork created by one of the owners of the store, mirrors, lighting, and some bedding.  Even if you're not in the market for anything in specific, Michael Todd's is worth a meandering.  Go check out this great local shop.  Why?  Because it's great! (and clean, btw.  VERY nicely arranged store.)

This place was featured in an issue of the Phoenix magazine, so my friend and I, per our usual Sunday outings, went out to explore.  It's kind of off the main path, so be on the lookout for the big sign along 7th that tells you where to turn.    I didn't find anything to buy here today, but it's a great space.  The owners have this garage space that they fill with really metro and retro furnishings.  Very true to the name.  They have great pieces like this Frank Lloyd Wright armchair I thought was fantasic.  Alas, the chair was a bit out of my league (can anyone spare me $1500?), but I'd expect as much since it was an FLW original.  There were other pieces that were a bit more wallet-friendly, so it's a good place to go to look for some fun furnishings to liven up your own space.    Also a plus: the owners are really friendly.  When we pulled up, they were chatting with some folks outside the garage, and when they left, they were really quick to acknowledge us and ask us about what we were in the market for.  They didn't persevere, either.  They just told us that if we didn't find anything today, they always have new stuff coming in, and to check them out again.  I intend to.    Sidenote: There's a cat leashed up as kind of a greeter at the entrance to the garage, which I found kind of cute, so that's just an added bonus.

Your one-stop shopping center for food, booze, school supplies, kitchen basics, some household goods like stools and picture frames, ASU clothes, and drug-store necessities.  The people working here are so friendly!  Everytime I go shopping, there is a greeter who says hello and usually offers an ad if I'm not already carrying one.  Every employee I come across while shopping also says hello and asks if I need any help finding anything.  The store is clean, the prices are always right, and if they're not, they'll match a cheaper price.  They also discount you for each eco-bag you bring and use, so be sure to bring a few!  (and be sure to mention it.  sometimes, they forget to punch it in.)  Also, if you're new to town, be sure to stop by the customer service desk to get a VIP card (for free) before you start shopping so you can get all your stuff for the VIP price.

OMG.  This place is awesome!  At first, I wasn't sure what I was getting into as I drove from Tempe out to the country-esque suburb known as Gilbert for dinner, but as soon as I saw the neon signage and gravel parking lot for Joe's Farm Grill with picnic tables outside and the line out the door, I knew I hit the jackpot.    As I stood waiting in line and trying to figure out the system of ordering for JFG (it's not confusing at all.  you just order like normal.), I saw posters up of Guy Fieri, the guy (no pun intended) from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network.  Apparently, he had been there to tape a show on JFG and feature their onion rings (which i then promptly ordered, which were not only good, but HUMONGOUS).  In all honesty, though, I liked the sweet potato fries better than the onion rings.  Anyway, I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwich with a side of cole slaw, the onion rings, and a vanilla shake while my friends ordered burgers and sweet potato fries.  Everything was DELISH!  The price was also perfect, and the people were totally friendly.    What makes JFG great in addition to everything else is their attention to detail like their focus on local ingredients.  I'm a big fan of supporting local agriculture (including fruits, veggies, and meats), so it's great that JFG supports it, too, to the extent that they can.  I noticed that at the bottom of the menu, it said: Spring 2010, so I'm assuming that the menu changes seasonally based on the farm goods available.  JFG also tries to not use prepared foods much, so they create their own sauces and bread their own onion rings.  Joe's Farm Grill is everything that other restaurants should strive to become, and I HIGHLY recommend you go.  They also have what appears to be a killer breakfast menu, so I might have to try that out in the NEAR future.  Note: If you notice that no condiments or drinks were given to you on your tray or filled in your cup, don't do what my friends and I did and stand there looking for them.  You have to walk out the door.

I never thought I would become one, but alas...I have become one: a Sprinkles fan.  What the heck.  Before ever setting foot in a Sprinkles store, I had this image that it was for rich Beverly Hills types who had all the money in the world to spend on ridiculous things like cupcakes, but after actually going to Sprinkles (again and again), this place grows on you (or you on it), and you discover that its sweet cupcake love is available to all.  I'm not gonna lie.  First time I tried it, I was like, What's the big deal?  It's good, but it's not great.  And then, after a week or so, I was like, I want to go again and try a different cupcake.  So I go, I try, I like, and then, another week goes by, and I somehow find myself back in line at Sprinkles, eyeing the day's cupcake flavors and trying to make a decision.  It's a sick, somewhat pricey ($3.51 for one cupcake), fatty cycle, but I wouldn't have it any other way.    Also, Sprinkles does great things occasionally, so be on the lookout at their website or on azcentral.com.  This past weekend, they were doing a charity event where all red velvet cupcake proceeds went to Haiti relief (no guilt!), and the weekend before then, they were giving away free red velvet cupcakes if you wore an AZ Cardinal t-shirt or hat.  Great cupcakes + great ideas = bliss.  PS: Give the banana cupcake more love.  If you like bananas, you will NOT be disappointed by the banana cupcake.  It will treat you right.  I highly recommend it.

I entered the CPK world late in life, and I'm sad about it because, apparently, I've been missing out.  CPK is great!  Contrary to what I thought, it's not just a place for pizza.  Although the place can suit all sorts of tastebuds, I would recommend going JUST for the pizza.  I went this evening for the second time in two weeks and ordered the BBQ chicken chopped salad.  It maybe could've used a little more dressing, but it was still good, so I can't complain too much.  When I went last week, I ordered one pizza from the MANY great options available, and I have to say, there is a reason it is called the California PIZZA Kitchen and not the California SALAD or PASTA Kitchen.  So 'Yay!  I'm a fan.' of the PIZZA here.  The other stuff....meh.    The servers are always pleasant here, and I never wait a long time for the food to come out.  Prices are what you would expect for a chain restaurant.  Parking isn't usually a problem unless there's an event going on at Tempe Marketplace.  The up-side to eating at this particular location is that you can browse the shopping area before you stop in or after you're done eating.  Be forewarned: If you are ever asked if you want avocado with your salad, and you say yes, you WILL be charged extra.  Look out for this sneak attack.

As cultured as my palate is, I have never enjoyed Thai food.  It has always been my least favorite type of food...until now.  I was reluctant to go to Tipp's because I have always had a bad experience with Thai food, but my friend wanted to go for her birthday, so who was I to refuse?  I'm so glad I didn't.    Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed the spaciousness and cleanliness of the area.  There's a cute little bar you can sit at if you want, too.  We were greeted by a friendly man who promptly seated us and was then quickly waited on for our drink orders.  My friend LOVED the Thai iced tea she ordered.  I forget the name of the entree I ordered, but it was kind of like pad Thai but with squid.  The squid came out perfect and complemented the noodles just right.  One of my other friends ordered the Hawaiian rice plate, and it was really good as well.  The portions are kinda big, the prices are kinda perfect, and the service is kinda awesome, so I highly recommend.  If you think you hate Thai, think again.  Go to Tipp's.  Note: There appears to be a party area, so if you're looking to host a bigger group, I believe this place can accommodate.

I'm so glad there's a World Market in my life again because this place is awesome!  They sell such a huge array of things, and though the prices might be more than ideal, check out the sale stuff because those prices are usually more right than wrong.    Be sure to also stop by the liquor section if you like drinking because they have a fantastic collection of beer/wine/champagne from all over the world for a really reasonable price.  They usually also have beers from around the world (which is a huge hit with my dad) for a really good price as well.  They are seasonally-sold, so in the summer, you might find micro-brews, while in the fall/winter, you might find more holiday-esque beers with a pumpkin taste or hint of cinnamon.  If you love stores like Anthropologie but want something a little more budget-friendly (and sells booze), this is your place.  Go explore!  It's SO worth it!  (then afterward, you can check out the rest of tempe marketplace.  great store, great location.  what more can you ask?)

The Grand Lux is my FAVE restaurant in Chicago, so when I found out there was one in Scottsdale, and my friend wanted to go there for her birthday, I was totally there.  We waited about five minutes to be seated, and once we were, we were promptly greeted by our waiter (whose name i unfortunately do not recall) who was sooo attentive and full of info.  Our waters were continually filled, and when we asked for more bread, he was sure to keep 'em comin'!  The menu here is huge, so if you're indecisive like I am, I'd recommend taking a look online before you come because you'll sit there forever trying to decide what to order.  I asked our waiter for his top three, and he was more than happy to provide: Miso salmon, Moroccan steak, and spicy buffalo sandwich.  Even though they were heavy contenders, I ultimately decided to go with the Devil's Chicken, which was SO good!  Even though I was full, I continued to eat and kept my membership in the Clean Plate Club.  Then, my friend and I shared a strawberry shortcake, which I HIGHLY recommend.  Our waiter brought out the dessert with a candle on it and made sure to hide it from the birthday girl so she wouldn't see it right away.  Talk about attentive.  Note:  Although the prices here might seem a bit steep, know that your portions are really generous, so it's worth it.  Also take note that if you go in here expecting it to look anything like the one in Chicago, you will be disappointed.  It's not as spacious or as GRAND, but the food and service is still great.  Go.

To be fair, let me start off by saying that this place has good food.  The reason it's getting two stars is cuz of the service.  My friends and I went here last nite partly to eat and partly to hear The Samba Project perform.  Well, we get there, it's crowded, there's a line, and I hear the couple in front of us ask the hostess how long the wait will be.  Well, instead of just giving the couple a number, the hostess was all, Well, we just sat, like, a TON of people, so I don't know.  I mean, there's one group that's been here for three hours, so you know....   Um...what?  I found that response unprofessional and unnecessary, so I was a little turned off right then.  By the time we get to the hostess, she gives us the same spiel and has us wait by the bar area (VERY little).  Luckily, the restaurant decided to open up its gates, so there was a LITTLE patio area to hang out at until our table was ready.  So, we're called probably an hour or so later, and we are seated...with no menus except the one we grabbed from the hostess when we went to wait at the bar.  John, our waiter, shows up and was all, Can I get you more drinks?  Um...sure.  But more importantly, can you grab us some more menus and take our food order?  We're hungry!!!  Not so much the case, though.  Instead, he proceeds to try and figure out who is on what tab and what tab needs to be closed at the bar, but really, there were only two tabs going: Mary and Matt's.  So John goes to close the tabs and returns with one receipt, asking, I'm sorry.  What was your name again?  Pat?  No, John.  MATT.  How did you forget in two seconds?  Then, he asks about drinks, and a few of us order iced teas.  John never mentions that they are sweetened and flavored peach, so some of them had to be returned.  Yet, upon taking those drinks away, he never asked about getting us something else to replace the drinks that some of us didn't like.  After finally taking our food order, we had to wait another 45 minutes to get our food: a few paninis with chips on the side and an order of bruschetta.  And we got that only after asking John where our food was.  He never came back to ask about more drinks or to refill waters, and I'm pretty sure that we probably could've walked out of there without having paid, and no one would have noticed.  The food was good, though, thank goodness.  I ordered the Chevito panini (flank steak with cheese, peppers, onions).  The bread was nice and toasted, and the inners really complemented the bread and the chips that came as a side.  The $10 price tag was also really do-able.  Note: You get a surprisingly filling portion of food, so go semi-hungry.  Though I didn't eat any bruschetta, it looked amazing.  You can choose from three different kinds off the menu of eight or nine, and those are also of a pretty big size.    The atmosphere is nice, the food is good, the prices are good.  The service is as if they don't know what to do or are overwhelmed with a lot of customers, the waitstaff don't really wait on you, and also a negative to note: the parking lot is way too small for the place.    I would probably go again for the food and atmosphere, but I'd really have to consider what day and what time cuz the staff is just....in need of help.

After reading all the great reviews about this place, I just HAD to go, so I gathered three of my friends and drove the 20 or so minutes from Tempe to get there, foregoing any pressure to get homework or reading assignments done (or, for some others, foregoing the desire to see a new episode of 'melrose place').  So glad because it was SO worth it!  EVERYTHING in Sweet Republic is made from scratch and uses as much (if not all) local ingredients, mostly from Singh Farm.    They also have such creative (and some non-dairy) flavors like cantaloupe sorbet or mango lassi sorbet or Banana Bonanza ice cream (with bits of banana walnut bread).  I sampled the mint ice cream, and it's not like any other mint ice cream I've ever tasted.  Why?  Because it tastes like REAL mint!  I KNOW I'll be back here again and again.  Oh, and I HIGHLY recommend topping off your ice cream with a made-from-scratch marshmallow because they torch it for you to just the perfect roast-ability so that the outside is kinda crispy and the inside is gooey.  When you mix it with the cold ice cream, though, something fantastic happens, and you're in perfect, organic, gelateria/sorbet/smoothie bliss.    I might also note that you can spend some time at Sweet Republic because they have a few board games that you can play with there.  It's also kid-friendly, seeing as when I went, there was a group of kiddies there.  So cute.  Anyway, in short, if you have not gone to Sweet Republic, you MUST get there soon cuz you don't know what you're missin'.  PS: I might also note that for those of you allergic to cow's milk, they also have options using goat's milk.  So forward thinking.  I love this place more and more.

It's unfortunate that this place wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be because I would've liked to continue supporting it (seeing as how there are not many hawaiian restaurants around the tempe area).  I ordered the chicken teriyaki meal, and my friend got the Hawaiian chicken meal.  The rice is fine, and the macaroni salad is actually quite good.  The main part of the meal, though, was kind of...fatty?  I dunno.  The flavor was actually ok, but there was something about the chicken that was NOT ok.   The chicken was definitely not as lean as the chicken I'm used to eating at other restaurants, but maybe that's how chicken is prepared in Hawaii.     That aside, it took quite a while to get our food.  The place kind of looked like the next step up from a fast-food joint, so we expected our food to come out a little faster than it did.  Granted, there was only one woman working the entire place when we went, but still...where were the other workers?  I also think the food was just a tad overpriced.  For the quality, it could afford to have been a dollar cheaper, I think.  I didn't try the boba tea, which the restaurant appeared to be emphasizing with its gigantic signs, so maybe I need to go back and try the tea.  There was a group of people who came just to get the boba tea, so perhaps WikiWiki is not the place to go for food, but it IS the place to go for boba tea (and, i would argue, decent macaroni salad).

I'm not sure if I was expecting too much and got caught up in all the hype surrounding this place, but I have to say...meh.  I've experienced better.  The taste of the food wasn't anything that left me saying, I MUST return here!  I can't even remember what kind of curry I ordered, but it didn't come with rice, so there was an extra charge.  Bummer.  My friends ordered dhaba thalis, which is kind of a sampler dish, and I'll give credit to The Dhaba for loading the food on there.  Perhaps that's the way to go here.  The service was also not impressive.  It wasn't bad, but it was just...slow?  The girl who was our waitress kept coming back to our table without food to tell us the status of our food and that it was going to be delayed.  I suppose that's a courteous gesture, but at some point, I got to thinking, Just come back when you have food.    Though I'm giving The Dhaba only 2 stars, I give their mango lassi and their decor 3 stars.  Check it out.  Overall, I found this place decent enough, but I've had better.

I went here with a couple of friends during Restaurant Week, and I have to say that I didn't LOVE it.  The menu was impressive with its edamame dumplings and teriyaki brown rice with tofu, but the food itself wasn't AWESOME.  It was kind of like, Ok.  I tried the place, but I'm in no rush to return anytime soon.  I also wasn't particularly impressed by our waitress.  She was a bit too perky and a bit too in-your-face about the greatness of True Food.  I love everything that True Food stands for, but there was something that was a bit snooty about the environment.  There was so much emphasis on the greatness of True Food that I was kind of turned off by it.    I will say, though, that the natural refresher drinks are really good.  I had the cucumber refresher with cucumber and honey lemonade.  Highly recommend.   Not too much cucumber taste and just enough honey lemonade that it wasn't too sweet.  Here's my overall rating:  Food: Meh. Price: Not awesome, but tolerable. Parking: No problem. Service: Not impressed. Ambience: A bit too trendy. Chefs: Cute.  Also particularly questionable to me was: who the hell is Dr. Weil?  Where I come from, he's a foot doctor.  Apparently around these parts, he's some bigger dude that is qualified to discuss healthy living.  Hm...

Blech, blech, and more blech.  Actually, I'll take one 'blech' back because the drinks are pretty decent here.  That's about it.  If you're planning on getting food, I'd recommend the REALLY huge onion rings or the alligator appetizer.  Otherwise, steer clear of the food.    You might also want to steer clear of the bathroom because at least on the girl's side, the place was like a scene out of a horror movie...or a bar where one too many people have probably thrown up.  The waitress we had was nice, but the guy who greeted us at the door appeared to be drunk.  I wasn't even sure if he worked there.  The place is packed with ASU undergrads, as it's located right across the street from campus, and some other random people (like the guy who greeted us at the door).  My other complaint is that parking sucks, so if you're planning on going to Barney's, you might want to walk.    Overall, IF I were to return here, I'd probably only go for drinks...or after I'd already had a few and didn't know any better.

Awesome!  The cheapest yogurt shop in town, AND the best.  Everytime I go in, there are a couple of new flavors, and they're all really good.  For instance, I had boysenberry with s'more-flavored yogurt, topped it off with some mochi (my favorite!), mini m&ms, strawberries, and blueberries all for the low price of $2.97.  The flavors with the topping options along with the unbeatable pricing makes this place a must-go.  The outdoor seating is pretty sweet, too.  (anyone who enjoys to hear what your company is saying might prefer to sit outside because the music inside is ridiculously louder than it should be)  For those of you new to Yogurtland: You take a cup and fill it with your choice of ffo-yo, take it down the line to top it off with anything you want, and then put the cup on the scale next to the register.  You'll pay based on the weight of your cup.  If you want to sample some fro-yo prior to making a final decision, don't be afraid to ask for sample cups at the register.    PS: As if Yogurtland wasn't awesome enough already, they also give you biodegradable spoons to use to satisfy your fro-yo craving.  Very green, fashionable, AND sturdy.

I love this place.  I was curious about it, so I went the first week it opened, and I have to say, SO cute.  The decor makes it seem as if you're outside in some Italian village.  The coffee is pretty good, too, and the donuts are awesome.  Right now, you get a free one with the purchase of a drink.  I also just went and got a Southwestern chicken salad from there, and they give you a free drink with your order, which was a nice surprise.  The salad was awesome, and my friend, who ordered the chicken salad croissant, said her food was delicious, too.    The people here are also SO nice.  The first time I went, I had a girl come around and ask me how I was doing twice.  Tonight, the owner came around and asked how I was doing and gave me a free refill on my drink for no reason.  The employees are new, but they're really friendly, so I let it slide that they might be a little slow right now.  We've all go to start somewhere, right?  It might be a pit pricier than what I would like, but it's not crazy, and it's worth it to help out this new, friendly coffee shop.  Note: Drive-thru is available.  Wi-Fi is coming (if not already available), and there's a study area with a larger table for group sessions.

I was excited to try Smashburger today for the first time after a meeting, but I have to say...I've experienced better.    The menu is decent with enough variety to choose from to keep people coming back (you can choose to have a 1/3 lb, 1/2 lb, or chicken burger for a kind of 'burger'), but there are better burger places to make this place someplace I'd want to keep returning.  First off, there are no combo meals.  You have to get everything a la carte, but if you buy a side with a burger, you get $1 off the side.  Still, I got a 1/3 lb mushroom burger with veggie frites, and I paid about $10.  No drink included.  At a place that is technically fast-food.  And THAT was supposed to be a deal.  Second, the veggie frites were kind of soggy.  There was no crispity crunchy outing that I would have expected from fried veggies.  And they were a bit salty.  And Smashburger was kind of stingy about how much they gave me.  The dip they gave me for the frites were good, though.  I dipped the burger in it, too.  I mean, the employees are friendly, the food is made to order so it's fresh, you have the freedom to basically make your own burger, and the egg bread that my burger came on was really good, which is all great, but for a college kid who's got to be financially responsible, better overall value can be found someplace else.

I LOVE this place!  My friend and I were on a Tour de FroYo until Aloha came around.  We needed to find a locale that was a compromise for us distance-wise, which is how we found this place, and I'm so glad we did because now, I can't go anywhere else!  The flavors are always changing, and though they have stand froyo, they also have a fun time creating their own flavors from scratch.  The toppings are ALL there (and not missing my faves like mochi and cheesecake bites like some places), and the fruit toppings are always fresh.  The price is also right.  In addition, the seating is awesome.  Can we say, Hello, leather couches?  What other froyo place has leather seating?  Right.  None.  There's also good reggae playing, and a mural of a tropical landscape behind the counter gives one the impression that they have literally gone to Hawaii and can say, Aloha!    Oh, and for all you non-dairy eaters, this place has at least one non-dairy flavor at all times (and it changes every few weeks), so don't worry that you won't find something for yourself cuz you will.  Be sure to grab a punch card, and if you're a newbie to this place, text the number located near the register to get 20% off right then and there and to continue getting discounts via text!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!

I have seen this place on the weekend evenings all packed with people looking like they're sardines in a can, so what possessed me to go there for brunch one day?  I shall never know.  I did, though, and I have to say, the food was yuck, the coffee was watered down, and the service was slow.  I ordered the two 'specialties' on the menu, which were the Sundried Scramble with sun-dried tomatoes, basil, goat cheese and scrambled eggs and the maple-bacon scone.  Aside from the fact that my brunch buddie and I literally waited 30 minutes for the food to come out, the food wasn't even that good!!  The Sundried Scramble was something I probably could've made myself at home (and better!), and the scone was just not good.  Actually, they brought out the wrong scone at first, and when the correct one came out, I thought, I should've just said not to bring one at all cuz it was drier than what people who don't live in Arizona consider the state's summers.  Also, as my friend and I were walking up to RnR, I saw one of the wait staff lounging around with sunglasses on.  Forgive me if I am wrong, but I think sunglasses should not be worn by wait staff at a restaurant especially for brunch if you are trying to make a statement that the place is as classy as Scottsdale thinks it is.  Shame on you, RnR.  I'm going across the street to go eat at Daily Dose.

I've passed by this place a few times and noticed it, but never went in until today, and I have to say, as a froyo snob, I actually liked it here!  There weren't as many flavors as Yogurtland, but the few they had were good.  I sampled the strawberry banana and the dulce de leche.  I was particularly smitten with the latter.  (ask for sample cups at the register)  I was NOT, however, smitten with the lack of toppings.  Well, to be fair, they were not 'lacking', but they didn't have a couple toppings that I always want on my froyo such as mochi and cheesecake (i'm aware this is a a strange combination, thank you).  As a possible condolence, they did have some toppings that I never noticed at other froyo places such as skittles and nerds.    The atmosphere is chill with seating outside, the decor is quite modern and cheery, and with froyo priced at only 35 cents per ounce, this is a great place to hang with friends, family, and/or your pet (they have water bowls outside).  If you plan to frequent this place often, be sure to grab a punch card.  Buy 9, get the 10th free!

One thing I hate is bad customer service for no GOOD reason.  Take, for example, the service of this place.   I called to get some information on the apartments, and the woman I was talking to (linda, i believe) limited the number of questions I could ask!  I could understand if I had been taking up 20 minutes of her time,...no.  I take it back.  Even if I HAD taken 20 minutes of her time, who tells you how many more questions you can ask??  In any case, I kid you not, I was on the phone with her for a total of 3 minutes and 10 seconds!  So, somewhere before three minutes had hit, I was told that I could only ask one more question.  Apparently, some people had walked in the door that I all of a sudden became unimportant.    I'm no dummy.  I understand that prospective renters walking in the door are more likely to seal the deal than a prospective renter on the phone, but come on.  You were helping me first!  The other people can wait!  The whole thing was just rude, and I can only imagine what it would be like to live at Sunset Villas.  The fact that Linda had to cut me off so abruptly tells me that there is not enough people working in the front office, so if I were to live here, my needs would be put in some order of importance based on what I was requesting.  I also did not feel valued as a prospective renter and felt that I was disposable.  Good luck getting any of MY friends to rent from you, jerks.
