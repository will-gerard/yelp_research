If you have never experienced the delectable heaven that is See's candy you are missing out.  Honestly, this place has been here for at least 70 million years and I think the brachiosaurus was just as big of a fan of the truffles as I am. I love the classic black and white checkered tiles and the adorable smocked emplyees. The brand has this quaint old timeyness that I really dig. Mary See is the grandmother I always wanted!   I love that they ALWAYS give you free chocolate and have amazing customer service all around. It is so much fun to go and hand pick a few treats for me and the roomies. The quality and uniqueness of their offerings make it definitely worth the trip. If you love chocolate then you should be asking yourself why you haven't stopped in before now. I am eating a pumpkin pie truffle right now that is rockin' my world, thank you!

Consistently delicious and crazy cheap. Amazing tortillas, chorizo burritos, tacos, machaca and tostados. Don't be deterred by the shabby exterior. Be cautious in evenings though...I was once accosted by a smelly derelict demanding money on the way in who was laying across my car when I left... I was pleasantly surprised when I went back into the establishment and two kitchen employees promptly jumped the counter and scared him off. Still doesn't stop me from coming back! It's worth it...

This place has TERRIBLE customer service. I had been there the week before and received an incorrect order. I decided to try again and when I asked for brown rice the 50 something chinese woman was extremely rude. Nonetheless, through our conversation I was eventually confident I would receive what I wanted. But, why argue with me and have an attitude? If you have it fine. If you don't, just say so. It was such labored communication and she had a crappy attitude. I felt like I was burdening her and practically had to force her to double check with the kitchen to make sure they had it. After driving 20 minutes home I discovered white rice. (My error for not checking as I thought I'd made it abudantly clear!) They were already closed so I couldn't call. I was in the area a couple days later and decided to drop in. I brought my receipt back and expained what had happened only to find the woman I originally dealt with and another employee arguing with me whether I in fact received the wrong rice and secondly practically calling me a liar because I hadn't called them. Eventually, their resolution was they are unable to authorize a free meal and I'd have to call the owner... I couldn't care less about a free meal and they couldn't care less about treating a 7 year customer with any consideration. EVERY restaurant makes mistakes. It's not a big deal and I am a very reasonable customer. What is a big deal is when they refuse to remedy the situation properly and show a little kindness and concern. I will not be returning.

There is something to be said for the exceptionally friendly staff at this place. The eggrolls and shrimp lo-mein are good, not great. The sesame chicken is flavorful, but a bit on the dry side. It's not something that you're going to go out of your way for.... I think they used to be a lot better a few years ago. Just be sure to have the appropriate expectations if you make your way in here.

Okay, so I admit it. Sometimes I get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of it's competitors. It took me a while to cave on this one. Too long in fact.  Everyone loves Lux and as it happens, they have good reason to! My latte was supremely delicious. The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service.   I absolutely love the patio area. This place definitely has a Pacific Northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me. The service was really laid back, yet authentically friendly. I was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that Lux has to offer. There's room in my heart for Lux after all so I shall return. My primary concerns going in were the coffee, service and atmosphere. A+ for all in my humble estimation.   I was a little late to the party, but I had a blast anyway.

This is my go to lcoation for all things a gamer girl needs. The staff is always really helpful and nice. They've always been awesome via phone too, saving me some trips in to the store. I always get my preorders here!

This food sucks. I would rather spend 20 cents on ramen noodles because I would end up happier. Even when a coworker drags you here just pass on putting any of this in your mouth. No matter how hungry you are!

The food here is blah. I'd rather eat tacos from a dozen places I pass on the way here... The bar atmosphere is crowded on weekends... standing room only in fact. Drinks are okay, lots of TVs to go with the fake beachy vibe. The music was not my groove but did observe some hilarious drunk dancing that was the most entertainment to be had... If I am invited to yet another birthday bash here, I may or may not decide to come.

I made my way in to Total Wine to see if they carried Ace Perry Cider, which I used to drink at George and Dragon ll a few years a go. After admiring the impressive inventory I sought some help to hopefully locate my libation of choice and the employee was efficient and helpful. It was clear that they had plenty of staff eagerly addressing people's needs. They even had my cider in two sizes.  I'm not a frequent drinker, but this will definitely be my go to purveyor when the need for fermented deliciousness arises.   The myriad of choices and strong focus on customer service did not disappoint!

Okay, I was sick of hearing about these subs so I had to nosh here just to weigh in. First off, I think the use of "world's greatest sandwiches" and  "gourmet" is a bit of false advertising. Um, I'm fairly certain the avocado on my beach club came from a tube. Also, I don't get why I was instructed to reach over the counter if I wanted my food in a bag or needed napkins. I thought that's why one exercises the phrase "to go." I'm not lazy, but gosh darnit there are three of you and no other customers are here. I don't get it. They'll drive miles for free to deliver the food but can't be arsed to throw the stuff in a bag? Even (Insert crappiest fast food chain of  your choice here) does that! Since you guys can do eveything so fast you have plenty of time left over to put the freakin' food in a bag for a girl with her hands full already! Whew, sorry. Moving on...  I'd like to dispel the most prevalent assertions swirling around the much ballyhooed Jimmy John's.  #1. "They are waaay better than Subway." This is true. But, isn't that like saying a c*** punch is much more pleasant than a double c*** punch? Edging out Subway in a taste test is the not brass ring to be reaching for!  #2. "They are soooo cheap." Yeah, not really. I think it's an okay value in relation to the quality, but stop raving about it like it's a $2 trip to Tijuana with tacos and tequila included. (Because that would be fantabulous.)  #3. "They have the BEST bread." I concede the bread is the best thing about the sandwich, but that's only because the rest of my sammich's innards were nothing spectacular. The turkey is just so so. Not bad, but not flavorful at all. So, the bread is not the earth shattering, yeasty lusciousness that people make it out to be. Truth be told I'd be happier if there were options. (They have some kind of sliced wheat that they basically told me no one likes!)   It's not that I would never partake because I get that its decent and they deliver. But come on my friends, quit swilling the kool aid.

I really enjoyed my first visit here! So much in fact that I spent five hours of my time here... The coffee was really good. I really dug the laid back homey vibe here. The patio is awesome...Super cozy, big, lots of misters... I'll definitely be back and would love to try the crepes. I like that it isn't obnoxiously hip too. Mmmmm, an Americano sounds good right about now!

It's been over three months and we're still going strong. JoBot Coffee is phenomenal. Love the iced toddy, love the people and love the atmosphere. Always good people watching on the spacious patio and a lovely place to watch fireworks I might add.  ...I knew it was love at first sight!

I decided to go here because of a Groupon. I left a voicemail specifically explaining I needed an appointment for me and my mother to come and it needs to be on a Saturday. It took them 4 days to return my call and I was told they were having computer problems and would call me the following Monday to set up the appointments. I did receive the call and conveyed once again that I needed 2 same time or back to back appointments for a Saturday.   We show up and were told they didn't have enough hydro therapists to accommodate us both, but one appointment could be kept. I once again explained the whole point of doing it the way I did was because my mom wasn't so keen on going through this alone and wanted the treatment done before an upcoming Colonoscopy. So, I rescheduled the appointments for us both once again.  The next trip over mom ran late to my house so it was evident we'd not be getting there on time. I called on the way over to explain we were and to see if we could be accommodated or not. I gave my specific cross streets at the time of the call which were Southern and Hardy. The person I talked to said "We are running behind so just hurry." I was thrilled since we wouldn't have to reschedule yet again.   I was shocked that upon arrival the woman standing at the counter was glaring at me the second I entered the suite. (I kid you not!) She immediately started our dialogue by asking me if I KNEW my appointment was at four o'clock. I explained that I talked to someone to confirm we should still come in once I realized we'd be late. She started to argue with me and actually brought out the person I talked to who admitted that yes they said what they said to me, but they didn't realize it would take another ten minutes for me to get there and it was too late because they close early that day.   I was perturbed for 2 reasons: First, don't tell me to go ahead and come in when you can't keep my appointment. Had they just said "Sorry we're booked solid and you'll need to reschedule" it would have been no big deal. Secondly, Why would you after realizing this had happened be waiting and seething and prepared to scold me when I walk in? Especially considering this person was the manager! Honestly, she was immediately hostile about it. She also was aware of the previous error of theirs which was beyond inconvenient... Why not just be prepared to say "I'm sorry that she didn't realize we couldn't take you when you kindly called to let us know you'd be late and were told to come anyways...?" I would have once again been irked at the wasted trip but it would have salvaged the faintest desire to follow through with this thing... Instead we were brow beaten for being late to begin with.   I love how I should be understanding when they screw up, but when we have an honest misunderstanding I get chastised and treated like I'm being unreasonable. At this point she didn't even offer to reschedule, but sharply said "Do you want the number to Groupon or not?"   HA! At this point they don't want to even try to do business with us anymore! This experience was totally unexpected. I thought there would be shit involved, but not because I'd be treated like it...(LOL)  I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want rude, angry people being the ones shoving a water hose up my ass anyways!!!
