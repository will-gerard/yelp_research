Nice patio, and interesting salsa with the chips while you wait for your meal, but I can't believe what we got for $70: Four $7 margaritas that had no trace of alcohol and three forgettable tacos. Plus we were charged extra for a side of rice ... Rice and beans are standard sides in Tex-Mex and don't cost extra. That's the way it should be.

I barely remember my visit here. So it must have been good.  Seriously, they have a great beer selection. And from what I remember, the wine choices are nice as well. The atmosphere is cozy and laid back. A fun spot.

What a fun spot! It looks like a great place for a burger and a shake, but we stopped in for breakfast. Had a wonderful breakfast burrito (something we don't really have here in Texas, and the only improvement I would have made would be to add some hot peppers and cilantro). It was the "Machaca Burrito" ($4.95, grilled beef with onions, peppers and eggs in a flour tortilla). The salsa that came on the side wasn't much, but the burrito was great.  The prices here are great. I don't know when I'll be in Cave Creek again, but I'd love to come back.

Pretty much the best place in Arizona. That gaping hole in the north section of the state runs a close second, but they don't have coffee and comfortable seating up there.
