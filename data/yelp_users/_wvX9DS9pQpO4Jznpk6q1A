Discovered this little hole in the wall while pinging my Yelp Blackberry app looking for adventure (and lunch).  It is close the the Southeast Annex of the Maricopa County Superior Court.  If you are interested in some good ceviche, this is a great place to go.  The ambiance is definitely humble.  The restaurant is situated in the corner of a strip mall containing a dollar store, a rent to own place, and a pawn shop.  Upon walking into the restaurant, I immediately noticed it was clean, and that there was no overpowering smell of seafood; both were good signs.  I was confused as to whether I should order at the counter, or sit down at a table.  (Silly gringo.)   If you are dining in, sit down at a table and they will bring you a menu.    The Diet Coke I ordered was brought to my table in a can with a glass of ice.  It appears that they have Mexican (cane sugar) Coke in glass bottles for those of you so inclined.  The menu had quite a few seafood choices.  There were also other items on the menu that i was not familiar with.  Salvadoran food is similiar to, but different from Mexican food.  Note that the pictures of the food on the menu do not do the actual food justice.  I ordered the ceviche and after a 10 to 15 minute wait, I was brought a very large plate piled with ceviche on top of lettuce ringed with tomato, cucumber, and avocado, and topped with grilled (hot) shrimp.  I was also brought a small bowl of chips.  This was a little different than the way I have had ceviche served in Mexican restaurants.  I am not sure if this is Salvadoran, or just this restaurant's unique take on ceviche.  I picked the grilled shrimp off the top with my fingers, squeezing off the tails.  I then dug into the ceviche with the chips unti I ran out of chips.  With the chips gone, I picked up my fork and finished the dish including the lettuce.  Everything, seafood and veggies,  was fresh and tasty.    The serving was extremely generous.  I left with a very happy panzita.  I will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu.

I have a new favorite sushi spot.  This is the best sushi I have had in Arizona.    I went in around 1:30 on a Saturday and sat down at the sushi bar.  The place is very cozy.  Would be a good place to go with friends and relax.  Very laid back.  Instead of ordering off the menu, I asked the chef to make whatever was good today.  He started me with the blue fin sashimi.  The fish was very fresh.  The tuna melted in my mouth.    I told the chef I was still hungry and asked him to make something else for me.  He made a delicious uramaki (rice on the outside) roll with salmon (I think), wasabe (the real stuff), and mayonnaise.  This was REALLY GOOD.    Like the Hungry Caterpillar, though, I was still hungry.  The chef then presented me with an interesting dish that was avocado and fish sitting on thin slices of lemon.  Not sure what the fish was, but the blend of lemon, soy sauce, and avocado was the perfect finish to this grand lunch.  While I ate and watched the chef, I chatted with the staff.  Everyone was very friendly.  Mikado Sushi is what going out for sushi should be: great food in a casual, friendly atmosphere.  If you like sushi and are adventurous, don't order, just let the chef decide what to make you.  It is extremely flattering to the chef, and he will go out of his way to impress you.

The food gets 4 stars, but they lose 2 stars for LOUSY service.  The pizza is pretty good NY style pizza.  The crust is cooked just the right amount, just a little crispy on the bottom and the perfect consistency to eat folded.  Because we are a family of five we tend to buy a whole pizza rather than by the slice.    Wings were also good and very saucy.  We got the mediums, and they were just the right amount of spicy for everyone to enjoy.  They had a deal for a large pizza and 25 wings for $22.  Watch out, though, because the drinks are $2.50 each, so with a family of five we paid over $12 just for the drinks!  Dining room and restrooms were both clean.  Unfortunately, what detracts from the Ray's Pizza experience is the service.  The service SUCKS.  We were told we would get the wings first, and then our pizza would come out.  They yell out to you from the counter when your order is ready, but you cannot understand what they are yelling out.  I kept checking to see if our wings were ready every time someone yelled.  After about 15 minutes, I went to the counter to ask about the wings.  They told me they take a while to cook.  (Huh?)  Finally, they called out our pizza order; still no wings.  I again asked about the wings and the man behind the counter said they would bring them to us.    We started eating the pizza and when the wings finally came they were COLD, like they came out of the refrigerator.  Even the plate they were on was cold.  I hate sending food back, but I carried them up to the counter and gave them back to be heated up.  The girl who was at the counter look perplexed when I told her the wings were cold, like she did not know what to do.  The man working the pizza ovens, though, took them and said he would heat them up and bring them out to us.  10 minutes later, we were finally eating our wings.  The service problem is not so much in the screw-up.  I am a forgiving person and mistakes happen.  The service problem is in the attitude  of the people who work there.  Just a rude and abrupt demeanor.  You are not a guest in there restaurant, they are doing you a favor.    It's too bad that bad service detracts so much from good food.

I love this little mom and pop Thai restaurant.  This is a weekday lunch spot for me.  The service is great, the owner always remembers exactly what I like to order,  the atmosphere is very casual.  Don't let the run down strip mall and the location right next to a DES office turn you off; good food keeps this place going.    If I am with friends we will get the Tom Ka Gai soup.  It is excellent!  For my entree i usually get the Gaeng Ped pork (Thai hot), which is a red curry dish with bamboo shoots.  If I am alone, I will get Gaeng Ped off the lunch menu which comes with an eggroll and a bowl of soup.  I also like the sweet Thai tea.  I always get the Gaeng Ped because it is just so good.    Honestly, I have not tried very many other things on the menu since I love the Gaeng Ped so much.

I used to come here regularly back in the '90s when I was at ASU.  I was in the Staples across the way and the cashier assured me this YC's was still good.  YC's is still a good choice for Mongolian BBQ, although it is not one the fanciest Mongolian place I have been to.  It is clean, has plenty of seating, the service is quite good, and the price is right.  I like that the meat is at the beginning of the line and the noodles at the end of the line.  (Anyone who is familiar with Mongolian BBQ will understand the architectural importance of putting the meat in the bowl first instead of trying to pile it on at the end.)    $8 for a small bowl and $9 for a big bowl.  The price includes soup and a drink, but not ice cream which is an extra $1.

Ugh!  I think I am going to be sick!  Please let the record reflect that I did not choose this restaurant.  It was chosen as a meeting place by my sister-in-law sight unseen.    Located in kind of a dingy strip mall, the place was pretty full on a Sunday night.  We took this as a good sign.  The staff was friendly and was very good about bringing drink refills and clearing plates.  The restaurant was relatively clean.  Let's get down to the heart of eating out, though, which is FOOD.  The food ranged from unexceptional to bad.  The eggrolls, jalapeno chicken, and fried wantons were not bad, but nothing special.  The coconut shrimp was the best thing  I ate and was actually tasty, but very heavy and greasy.  The hot and sour soup was okay.  Do not be tempted by the sushi.  I am skeptical anytime I see sushi at a buffet, but decided to try it anyway.  It was TERRIBLE!  The one nigiri I had was just awful.  The fish was not fresh and the rice was bland.  The one California type roll was similarly AWFUL.  I hope that sushi virgins are not getting this as their first taste of sushi, because it will turn them off to sushi forever.  The other items to choose from were standard Chinese buffet fare, but bland and greasy.  Nothing special here.  I was too afraid to try very much.  After eating at Great Wall Buffet, I feel cheap and dirty, but I did not even enjoy the experience.  If I am going to be so bad, it had better be so good.

This is another place on my regular lunch rotation.  I have been eating at Someburros for years frequenting the locations in Gilbert and by Chandler Mall as well as this location in Tempe.  This is deli style.  You go to the counter and order, they give you a number, and then bring the food to your table.  The restaurant is always clean and well staffed.  This location, though, is a little smaller than the Gilbert or Chandler Mall restaurants.  The food at Someburros is on par with any good Mexican restaurant in the Valley, but it is fast and inexpensive.   Most adult meals with drink will cost about $8.  Kids cost 1/2 that.    I usually get one of the burritos.  Lately the Crudo Burro is my favorite.  It is shredded beef with SPICY tomatillo sauce.  Do not order this unless you can handle spicy food.  I also like the Rod Burro and the Poncho Villa.  I really like the rice, as well.    Someburros also has large party platters.  A number of times we have purchased party platters for a gathering at our house.  Our guests always devour the food and rave about it.  It is a relatively inexpensive way to cater a party.  Someburros is a great place for lunch and a relatively inexpensive way to feed the family.  If you have not tried it, definitely check it out.

This is so close to my house that it is a shame that I have been driving by it for the last 4 years.  Finally, tonight, my wife was feeling adventurous enough to try a new place.  We were very happy with our experience and will be returning again in the near future.  Chips and salsa were good.  The salsa was a smooth, red sauce that I would define as medium hot, although I like SPICY food.  The chips were crisp and not greasy.  I had the Enchiladas Blancas which were green chile enchilada with a spicy cream cheese sauce.  They were very good and the tortillas were crisp.  The meat inside was delicious.  Rice was good and the bean salad side was interesting.  My wife ate the El Pollo Fundido.  It was one of the best I have ever tried.  The chicken was tender and not over-cooked.  My wife is Chicana and can be very picky about  her Mexican food.  That she liked La Casa Blanca means a lot.  The kids had chicken tenders and french fries, cheese crisp, and a bean burrito.  All of the kids reported they liked their meals.  They also had strawberry smoothies which were delicious.  Our waiter was quick, attentive, and friendly.  For the five of us, the bill came to just over $50, which I consider very reasonable for what we got.  We were very happy with our meal and sorry we had not tried this great restaurant sooner.

Who would have thought that I could get decent sushi at my local grocery store?  The fish is consistently fresh and delicious.  The calamari salad is also delicious.  Usually once a weekend, I am sitting in the comfort of my own home, drinking a Coke Zero, and stuffing myself with sushi.  I usually get 8 nigiri (1/2 salmon, 1/2 tuna), a rainbow roll, and a calamari salad (no lettuce, just sweet, delicious calamari).    They sell groceries, too.  Good selection and prices.  Nothing exciting there, though.

This place is on my regular lunch rotation when meeting friends.  I usually get the Aunt Chilada's Special which is a green chili chimichanga, or the tacos pescado (fish tacos).  It is the only place I have ever had fedeo which is a Mexican spaghetti.    I like the food, and more importantly, my Chicana wife likes the food and she is picky about Mexican food.  This is not the cheapest place for good Mexican food, but it is a fun place to meet with friends.

As many others have said: burger, fries, and Shasta soda for $5 including tax.  I was a big sport, though, and got the Fat Ass burger special which came with a double bacon cheese burger, fries and onion rings, and a Shasta for $7.50.  In a moment of weakness, I also went for a magic brownie.  Total bill $9.50.  Knowing that I consumed enough calories for a whole family: priceless.  The burger is like what your dad would make at a family cook-out.  Hand formed patties that are really thick compared to a McBurger.  The onion rings were good.  The fries were also good, but a little on the soft side.  I prefer a fry with a little more crisp to it.  I had the first black cherry Shasta soda I have had since I was probably 12.    The brownie was really good and definitely worth the $2 and associated guilt.  If the weather is good, there are places to sit outside both in front and in the back.  If the weather is not good, get your food to go; there is some seating inside along the windows, but it would probably get a bit crowded when it is busy.

This has got to be the WORST McDonald's ever.  I have lived less than a mile from it for 4 years.  I am not big on McDonald's, but my kids are.  I have learned to drive miles out of my way to go to another McDonald's.  Inevitably, though, out of laziness or maybe hope, I keep trying this McDonald's only to have the order screwed up or something to be wrong with the food (stale french fry grease anyone?)  or both.    Nothing like the look of disappointment on a child's face when their french frys taste of stale grease.    I am not sure if this is a franchise store or corporate owned, but it has consistently been TERRIBLE for FOUR YEARS.  This McDonald's just needs to be NUKED from orbit.

It's been 2 1/2 years since I posted my original review and this McDonald's still sucks!  We have learned to drive to the McDonald's on Alma School near Ocotillo as it has much better food and service.

I find it hard to believe that the Simpson's have not parodied the Brazilian Steakhouse, yet.  Seems like it would be Homer's fantasy come true.    Came here with a couple of friends who were taking me to lunch for my birthday.  This was my first time eating here, and I always read in the reviews of other places that this is the place that all of the other Brazilian steakhouses in Phoenix are compared to.  This place is top dog for a reason.  The restaurant itself is very nice with white linen, rich wood paneling, and a spacious dining room.    What can you say?  If you are a vegetarian, the salad bar is really incredible.  Figuring we would cushion the blow, we started at the salad bar.  I ended up making a plate for myself resembling an antipasto platter.  It was excellent.  There were cheeses, and prosciutto, marinated asparagus an inch think, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and things I did not identify, but were tasty anyway.  Once we were done dabbling in the vegetables, cheeses, and prosciutto of the salad bar it was time to get down to business; it was time for meat.    Each person has a coaster-like card that is red on one side and green on the other.  We flipped our coasters to green, and immediately we were overwhelmed by an onslaught of meat.    Like Homer would do, I just indiscriminately tried everything.  Don't ask me what I had, because I was too busy talking to my friends, drinking caipirinhas, and eating meat.  There was also polenta, fried banana, black beans, and bread.  Everything was tasty and delicious.  I ate way too much.  I glanced at the dessert menu, but was just too full to even seriously consider it.   The service is outstanding.  The wait staff was falling all over us serving meat, filling drinks, and bringing more bread, bananas, and polenta.  We never were without anything.  If you are interested in a Brazilian steakhouse in the Phoenix area, this is the place to go.

Tonight was my daughter's promotion ceremony from 6th grade and following family tradition I let her pick the restaurant and this was her choice.  She had eaten here before but this was the first time for me.  We had an excellent experience!  The food and service were both excellent.  I started with the antipasto, which was really good with lots of pepperoni, salami, and cheese.  We also ordered fried mozzarella sticks, you know, for the kids; the sticks were really plump and crispy and there were seven or eight on the plate.  For the main course I had Ricotta Cavatelli with Vodka Sauce and added a chicken breast.  This was really good and the portion was so generous I only ate half.   For desert we shared the chocolate lava cake with ice cream, which was also really good.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive and did a great job.  Atmosphere is casual, which is okay with me.  We will definitely be back.

This is located less than a 1/4 mile from my new office and was recommended by a friend of mine, so I had to try it.  I have eaten here twice and both times I got the Ultimate Taco with red chile beef.    The restaurant is a bit austere, but clean.  I had no problem finding a clean table at lunch time.  You order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table.     The Ultimate Taco is enough to satisfy my big appetite.  It is pretty big.  Wearing dress clothes, I did not dare try to pick it up and eat it for fear of getting red chile all over my clothes, so I ate it with the plastic knife and fork provided.    I am not a fry bread connoisseur, but I thought it was delicious and not too greasy.  The red chile beef is good, but I would like it a whole lot spicier.  (I like VERY spicy food.)  Fry Bread House is a once every couple of weeks treat for me and it is now in my regular lunch rotation.

We love the food here.  Service is also always good.  The place is always busy, so you would be wise to call ahead if you don't like waiting.  Our favorite, family friendly, Italian restaurant.  The salad and bread are really good.  The entrees have generous portions and are really delicious.  There is a kids menu as well.  The whole restaurant is moving to McClintock and Warner in March and they said that the new building will have more parking, outdoor seating, and more space.  They promised not to change the food.  The new location will be a little farther for us, but that won't keep us from going.

Came here for Sunday morning brunch.  The food was very good, but the service was below average and the wait was long.    We shared a cheese biscuit, which was good and I ordered the Breakfast Monte which was also good.  I was going to order a smoothie, but when I asked, the waitress told me that the smoothies were made from a mix, instead of fresh made, so I ordered orange juice instead.  I don't have any complaints about the food.  The wait staff was friendly, but they seem very disorganized.  This place would really benefit from better management and better trained wait staff.  The staff should have assigned stations with specific tables they are responsible for.  When we were seated, it seemed that there was confusion over who was going to be our server.  Once we were seated, there was a long wait for the server to take our drink order, then a long wait for the server to take our food order, then an even longer wait for our food.  We rarely saw our server.  Other people we chatted with afterward, seemed to have the same experience.  Overall, I would say the food is good, but not worth the extremely slow and disorganized service.  If they can improve the service, this would be a four or five star place.

Great little neighborhood Thai restaurant.  I had the red curry pork with brown rice Thai hot and it was really good.  My wife had one of the noodle bowls with meatballs and that was really good, too.  We will be back.
