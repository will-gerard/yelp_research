They offered a gluten free "menu" so I was happy to try it. It came out with a Heartland flag stuck in the sauce; apparently they used boxed gluten free pasta. I had asked for the meat sauce and they had spooned maybe 2oz onto the top of my plate of pasta. The "salad" was just a handful of iceberg mix. I could have bought all of the ingredients at the grocery store for a 1/4th of the cost and a jar of prego would have tasted better. They've been here since the 70s and I don't even know why people still come here.

My heating went out and so I gave these guys a call. The yelp reviews seemed good, but they didn't have an appointment for 3 days away. Bought a little heater at Walgreens and toughed it out. Come my appointment time, no one showed up. Called the office,  line was busy? Got someone else to come same day. Maria from the office called me 5 hours after my appointment to apologize. Nice of her, but a little late.

This place is fantastic. I've tried almost all of their options now and they've all been delicious. My favorite so far is the alambre. They have three sizes and even though I'm a big guy, the super is awesomely huge. Great for a double meal. The mini and regular are perfect lunch sizes. Great food, great prices. I highly recommend this place.

Our waitress Norma was awesome! Beyond awesome! No joke, ask for Norma. If your waitress isn't Norma, then your experience won't be 5 stars. Oh, and the food wasn't bad. I feel like some of the meats need a condiment as they tend to be a little dry. If it wasn't for Norma I would not have given this place 5 stars.

I used to order from this place at least twice a month, if not once a week. The food was great, consistent and decently priced. Ever since the new ownership, the food has gone downhill. The salads are brown and wilted, the staff gets confused when you order something custom, they often forget parts of your order for delivery and the last two times our pizza looked like it was stored on its side. Totally ruined the pizza and the experience. If you want something quick, it's not bad but there's a much better Rosati's nearby.

This place is sub par. First of all, the staff is only just nice enough to warrant the feeling of welcome. I felt that waiting on us was tolerable and it really reflected in our attitudes back. It wasn't that pleasant an experience.   About our food: We got edemame that was over cooked and burned 4 times and each time the girl just apologized and they tried again. We finally told them to stop trying when they offered to remake them a 5th time. Our bowls were all over cooked and soggy like they overcooked it and tried to fix it by adding water, totally ruined the flavors I picked. Half the ingredients were missing from the final product.I would not recommend this place for anything more than 2-3 simple ingredients at lunch time maybe. I won't be back. YC's is 100x better.

I have no idea why people like this place. I have been here several times with co-workers and dread it. The first time I went, I asked the waitress to surprise me with a taco trio. The flavors she picked sounded fantastic, but I was woefully disappointed. The flavors were drab and the tacos were greasy. I tried different combos afterwards, but none of them had a distinct flavor that left an impression. It's a cute concept being in an old church, but none of their food stands out.

I tried to like it, but the food falls very short. Nothing tastes fresh and everything is way overpriced.   Let me first start by saying that I work nearby and we were really excited for a new place to eat. I have been to Ocotillo 5 times now and each time has been progressively worse. Four of my visits were for lunch and one was an attempt at a happy hour. I say attempt because they have no happy hour, at all. We left for another place in the area after we had already ordered a drink and told they were closing soon. The servers don't know anything about the alcohol being offered, it's clear that there is no training or knowledge being given to them. They have also been out of most of their wine offerings the two times that I've tried to order.   Walking in, the first thing you will notice is that it's very, very noisy. They keep the music really loud and all of the hard surfaces cause voices to echo and reverb over your conversation. Don't expect to have a decent conversation or even hear your server unless you sit outside.   The roasted cauliflower was OK, but it would be hard to ruin such a simple dish.  The diver scallop ceviche tasted terrible. The scallops were chewy and I was pretty sure it was several days old.  The mole chicken salad comes with chicken nuggets covered in a flavorless brown sauce that almost resembles chocolate and for a "field greens" salad, it was 90% shredded cabbage.  The country pate is on par with Spam. It's dry, flavorless and sliced out. It was impossible to spread on the provided oversized bread that was better suited for bruschetta. For $14, I expected more than just a plate of a bunch of pickled greens and spam.  The smoked salmon sandwich tasted like it's been sitting in the fridge for a week.  The BBQ pork sausage sandwich came with raw sliced jalape√±o which made it totally inedible The brisket sandwich some how made it past expedition burnt and what little meat it had was mostly fatty. The caramelized onions and red peppers tasted like they came from a can.  The "crispy tofu"  Bahn MI was awful. The tofu was over cooked and had no flavor.  The Thai chicken dinner was incredibly salty, I'm pretty sure it had been sitting for days to have soaked up that much sodium. The pure salt content over powered any other flavor they had tried to include.   Now every restaurant has its issues, but each of these visits is over a span of several months. They are well passed the opening jitters. The place is trying to be trendy and hip, but it fails on even the basics. All of the faults appear to be from poor management and bad kitchen practices. It's a shame.
