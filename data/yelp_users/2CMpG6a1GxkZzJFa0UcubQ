I'm rating the "Express Exterior Wash" experience. This is my go to place when I just need the outside of the car washed. It usually takes anywhere from 10 - 15 minutes depending on how many people are ahead of you. They change out the brushes in the automatic part of the wash on what seems to be a regular schedule (I've been getting the exterior wash for a few years now and notice these kinds of things). It usually runs $5 and the bonus is they hand dry the car for you after you exit the wash. I end up spending $7 or $8 as I usually tip the person drying the car. Anyways, it's a great, quick, basic wash.  I can't speak to their complete cleaning experiences, but am happy with the service I do use! Will I go back? Absolutely!

I don't give five stars out often, but when I do. Anyways long story short, if you like really good craft beers and great food, this is the place! I've been going to Four Peaks since the owner(s) used to sleep in a cot in the back room. It can get crowded, probably the only downside, but the atmosphere, patio and overall vibe make it worth any wait you might have to endure. Check it out, you will be happy you did!

Almost two years since my last review at Four Peaks on 8th Street.  We did some Sunday brunch on the patio (One of my favorite things to do this time of year)! Service was great, as always!  Food was delicious! I had the breakfast Brickhouse burger, perfect for when you can't decide between breakfast or lunch.  The beers were tasty and refreshing as well.  Four Peaks is probably one of my favorite places to go in the valley!  If you are visiting the Phoenix area or haven't been to Four Peaks yet, just go.  I will caution that there can be a wait, especially when the weather is good. Parking can be a challenge, but if you are willing to persevere, get that parking space and possibly wait a bit to be seated, you will be handsomely rewarded! If you love patios, the wait will likely be longer, but the inside seating area is quite expansive if you don't care where you sit. Lastly, if beers like Miller lite and Bud are in your wheelhouse, then I would suggest this may not be the place for you, unless you're open to trying new things.  Great place to hang out and relax with friends/family!

This is a review of Happy Hour (runs from 3-7) at Stingray in Old Town. A really good experience with and easy on the wallet to boot! A number of great choices and some really good drink specials.  We had the Gyoza (pot stickers), shrimp shumai, dragon roll and the Las Vegas roll. We were seated on the patio, which was a nice high top overlooking Scottsdale road. Service was very good.  The gyoza and shumai were a good appetizer size.  The sushi rolls were good, but I would say great.  The happy hour pricing still puts the whole experience at a solid value. I would go back for Happy Hour again!

Frank and Eve (the owners), I hope you or someone who cares reads this! This is a review of the Chandler location.  I've been a long time patron of Chino Bandido, starting with their first location at 19th Ave and Greenway in North Phoenix. Quality, care and portions have always been the first priority. My last three experiences with the Chandler location over the past 4 months have gotten progressively worse each time. The most recent was this past Sunday evening around 6:30 for a carry out order.  The person who handled the order was very nice.  No issue here.  Although concern arose when she mentioned that the current kitchen staff was making the Egg Foo Yung we ordered for the first time. The Egg Foo Yung ended up being the best part of the meal, as well as the complimentary Snicker Doodle cookie. The Hengrenade Chicken was dry and leathery with little flavor left on or in it.  The Diablo chicken was also not their best effort, overcooked and dry as well. The fried rice tasted as though it had been in a steam pan for hours...crunchy, dry and flavorless.  The kind of thing I might expect at the end of the night from a lesser establishment. I'm not going to dwell on this, but unless some things change at the Chandler location, I really am not motivated to return at this point. If I'm up North, I'll try the 19th Ave location in hopes that the same issues are not occurring there. Frank and Eve (the owners) are wonderful people, so I am hopeful they take action and can get Chandler back to the really good Chinese /  Mexican fusion restaurant they once were.

The only reason I'm even giving one star is for the excellent Bell desk staff and the solid bartenders who worked the wedding reception.  The pool staff was very friendly as well.  They understand taking care of people.  It's unfortunate that the "management team", front desk and security staff need some remedial courses on how to treat guests. A couple examples of how the wedding day started.  The maid of honor went to the trouble the afternoon before to confirm if we could check in earlier than 4:00PM for the bride's suite and the two story tower suite we had reserved.  The wedding was to start at 4:00 PM, so a number of us planned on arriving at the Valley Ho to enjoy some lunch at the property for a couple of hours and then get ready for the wedding.  They didn't have the bridal suite ready, so they put the bride and bridal party in one of the smallest resort rooms I've ever been in.  Mistake 1. We show up a little before 1:00PM and are told, sorry the tower suite isn't ready, and we'll expedite its cleanup. OK, so literally over two hours later, around 3:00 they finally have the room ready.  Keep in mind we have a wedding that starts in less than an hour now.  Ridiculous. Mistake 2. I'm not going to beat a dead horse on what ensued the rest of the evening, up to and including security chomping at the bit to throw us out, and seemingly disappointed that I had cleared out the room per their earlier request, when they returned a second time. I'm *sure* the crack security team didn't confuse us with the raging bachelorette party going on three doors down from our room. You can read through other guest's feedback if you'd like more of the gory details. I was pretty excited to stay at a place that has been a part of Scottsdale history.  I was looking forward to a great weekend.  Despite the management and security team's best efforts to be a wet blanket, the wedding still happened and we're all glad for that. I suspect if you want a nice, quiet weekend experience alone or with one other person, in a mid-century motif property, that the Ho will be a nice fit.  Just make sure you're tucked in by 9:00PM. If you want to have any kind of an event or group function here, I would certainly look at the many other options the valley has to offer. Jessie T., save your canned response.  If you have something original and meaningful to say, by all means.

My first Yelp review of a financial institution.  What can I say?  It's a credit union.  I've been with them for many years.  My other bank is USAA.  I only dinged Desert Schools a star due to them not being able to renew my ASU Sun Devil's check card, due to another bank taking the sponsorship deal.  Minor I know, but it cost a star! Friendly staff, fairly efficient drive through, although I hardly use it any more. Coolest thing, the drive thru ATM gives out $50 bills when you take out a larger sum of money!  That's all I got on this.

Carnitas and mahi fish tacos are great here!  Your choice of taco shell is a nice touch as well.  Solid bar, fantastic tequila selection!  Not sure about prior reviews citing high prices.  None of the food items are over $10.

Awful.  Bunch of rude, arrogant whatever... Service was terrible, unless you are into waiting forever to place an order and then expect a heaping portion of attitude along with it. I don't go out to be treated like someone's doing me a favor. Do yourself a favor and avoid going here ever.

Terrible. Don't waste your money or time. We were going to have dinner here, but trying to place a reservation well in advance gave a big thumbs down to our group of 14. We ended up eating elsewhere at Tempe Marketplace and then went to the ranch.  The drinks were expensive by AZ standards and weren't right half the time, in addition to being pretty weak.  Place was pretty busy and a good amount of potential for a good night out.  Then about midnight they started throwing people out left and right.  We were celebrating a birthday and the birthday boy brushed up a against a "security" person and was ejected.  I've been going out a long time and have never seen anything like it.  They told the rest of group we could stay.  Ohhh, OK, you just tossed the guest of honor.  Then seeing other people being "profiled" and tossed out...really weird... We won't be back, ever.

Another great experience at Pita Jungle!  I've been here many times, but hadn't written a review until today.  We started off with a mix plate of roasted bell pepper hummus, jalapeno/cilantro hummus and baba ganoosh.  It came with two pitas and all three were very tasty!  Next up was the broiled chicken salad. Very tasty and the lemon vinaigrette dressing was delicious!  My friend tried the lavosh shawarma warp and enjoyed it very much.  The garlic sauce makes that wrap!  Our server, Skyler was excellent as well.  Everything just when you expected it.  Made many suggestions that applied to what we were ordering.  Genuinely gave a damn about what he was doing. Last but not least, offered up "to-go" drinks at the end of our meal.  Not in any way trying to get us to leave, just a nice touch before leaving.  Other things that may or may not matter to anyone reading this: It has a nice patio and open floor plan inside. Keep in mind it's directly across the street from Mesa Community College.  I notice all different kinds of people when dining here.  It adds to the whole experience for me.  I'm not hung up on clothing choices or body art my server(s) wear, as long as they are doing a great job.  Will I continue to go here?  Absolutely!

This review is long overdue and could have been written well over a year ago!  You won't find truffle oil, baby arugula or bleu cheese crumbles here. What you will find is a great, honest burger with any of the basics one might desire. I've been here a few times and the burgers as well as the Italian beef are excellent.  The owner is cool and there more times than not.  They use really good beef and it shows in the final product.  The other ingredients are fresh and tasty as well. The place itself is nice, clean and the staff have always been friendly. They cook to order right in front of you, on a flat top, so no surprises! Fries are crinkle cut and good.  I'm usually not a fan of the crinkle cut, but Lobby's are tasty! Will I go again, absolutely!

Yawn...another "Irish" pub....funny thing is, the owner of this one is Irish, I believe.  Modeled after Johnnie Fox's in Dublin, Ireland (not very well, I might add), although the real Johnnie Fox's might not appeal to the masses here in Arizona.  Interesting choice of location, right between two other well established Irish pubs (Casey Moore's and Rula Bula).  I'll give the bar staff 4 stars as well.  Friendly and attentive.  They lose a star for pouring their whisky not a ml heavy. Let's cut to the chase, If you want loud, college party atmosphere, show up after 10:00.  Don't look for a seat at the bar, as they will have removed them. If you want to enjoy a pint or two and average to below average food, it's OK, but I would rather spend my hard earned dollars somewhere else.

Discovered this place driving by it on Broadway, just east of Alma School. Lots of taco shops in the valley, but this one has a few things that simply make it better than the average slew of "(insert random name here)berto's" type places. First off, the tortillas they use to make the burros are delicious, almost as good as Carolina's.  My favorite item is the shrimp burro.  The shrimp are nice/firm, combined with rice and other filling to create an extremely tasty burro!  They offer a Diablo version of the same if you are feeling spicy! Their breakfast burros are also quite tasty.  Other items I've tried include hard shell tacos, taquitos and these tasty bags of tortilla rounds they either bake or fry and coat with sugar and cinnamon.  Simple, yet delicious! I have no opinion on the refried beans as I usually don't have them on or with anything I order. You can dine in (a few tables inside) or go through the drive thru.  I recommend going inside to see all the tasty options on their menu board. (You will find misspellings on the board, but hey, I'm more concerned about the food and service than an absolutely correct translated menu board) Is the place perfect, no, but what is?! I would agree with one of the other reviewers, that the fish tacos are not the best choice here.  Also, they have been a little slow on preparing orders a couple times, but it's always been worth the wait. Lastly the place is always very clean and the staff are very nice!

Excellent experience with Sprinkler Doctors! I called, left a voice mail and submitted a request for service on their web site. They got back to me the same day and scheduled a technician to come out on Wednesday between noon and three. I was told the tech would call me prior to arrival to confirm, and Jay did just that. The house call carries a base $60 charge, which more or less is applied to the first hour of work done. Jay was able to quickly identify the problem with one of the valve solenoids.  In addition to replacing that he inspected all of the sprinkler heads and found a couple more problems. Lastly he asked if I wanted him to program the timer, which I had him do as well. The systems is running the best it has in 5 years. I'm VERY happy with the entire experience! I would definitely call them again or refer them to anyone having issues with their irrigation system.

As always, skip to the last paragraph if you want the quick review!  I've driven by this joint on the north side of Indian School Rd. more than once and today I had an opportunity to stop and check it out.  I was getting it to go, but went inside to see what the place was like, rather than use the drive thru window. It is small, but what would you expect from a place called "The Stand".  I found it very clean and busy.  It was 12:30PM on a Monday.  There were three people ahead of me in line and a couple of people taking orders.  They moved us through pretty quickly. I ordered a burger w/cheese, a short rib taco, vege taco and a chocolate shake.  This will end up being two meals for me, but I always like to try a few different things when I go someplace for the first time. She asked if I wanted fries, I declined, she countered with "It's free fries Monday".  OK, I'll try the fries as well. My order was ready in about 10 minutes. The staff were friendly and you definitely got the feeling they were working hard to get things out as quickly as possible. Despite the small menu, they have some good offerings for the masses. I feel their pricing is fair.  The ingredients seemed to be of better than average quality, so I expect to pay a little more than average.  How does it go, do a few things and do them well.  Holds true at The Stand as far as I'm concerned.  The burger was reminiscent of old school In and Out, back when they were just in California, but just a touch better.  The shake was delicious, although could have been a touch smoother.  Fries were good as well.  If you like crispy fries, you'll probably want to request that when you order.  Vege taco was delicious.  Very well done.  Short rib taco was tasty too.  Will I go back? Yes, if I'm in the area and want a quick and tasty lunch!

Went an a Sunday at 10:30am We had a large group (10) people, so it took over an hour to seat us.  I expected this, so not a negative, just providing some insight. They seated half our group, then the other half about 10 minutes later.  Complimentary coffee while waiting is nice and the option to order a Bloody Mary or Mimosa, also a plus. I consider most breakfast joints very similar, so I'll go over the highlights  of this new venture:  Host and other staff were friendly.  Manager type person seating a couple at the counter where I was waiting on a couple of Blood Mary cocktails, not so friendly.  They could add a sign at the end of counter that says "walk up drink orders" and probably help out everyone. Breakfast cocktail selection was very good as well.  We tried the Gazpacho Bloody with pepper vodka and it was very tasty. Great and varied menu.  Creative offerings and the food itself was very good! We tried a number of things. The highlights included the Pancake flight, allowing you to mix and match three different pancakes.  Breakfast Pot Pie was delicious and filling.  They also had some tasty options for our non carnivore friend as well.  Regarding the comment about no paper towels in the bathroom.  The faucet has a built in Dyson Blade air hand dryer.  The only downside is if you are not familiar with this device you would benefit from reading the "how-to" they have posted right next to the sink.  Although I can certainly empathize that the last thing one might want to do on a Sunday morning breakfast is have to read instructions on how to dry one's hands! :)  All and all, good experience, great food.  Would I go back?  Yes.

Visited Potbelly on a Saturday around 12:30PM. Skip to the last paragraph for the short and sweet review.  I've seen this place a few times and finally had a good opportunity to stop in and grab a to-go order.  I like the name and figured it would be average (worst case), but hopefully I would be surprised. This location shares a building space with Starbucks.   Although parking is a bit limited I found a space straight away. I found the decor warm and inviting.  It smelled of toasted bread, a plus in my opinion. After a short wait for two people ahead of me a very pleasant and friendly person, Ann I believe, took my order. I ordered a tuna salad sub on multigrain bread as well as one of their signature sandwiches called "A Wreck" on their white bread.   I also substituted cheddar cheese on the wreck and no cheese on the tuna salad.  They toast their sandwiches, so into the toaster they went.  When they come out the other side you can ask to add your choice of condiments. I asked for lettuce, tomato and onion on both, with some Italian seasoning on the Wreck.  I added some Zipps kettle chips (delicious chips made in Louisiana) and a sugar cookie. My bill came to a total of $13 and change.  Most of the sandwich options are around $5. I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Arriving home I tried half of each sandwich along with the BBQ Zipps chips and found everything to be pretty good.  The bread toasted up nicely, leaving a crusty exterior.  Based on the price, I felt the sub had adequate amounts of ingredients.  There were options on the menu for extra meat and the like.  The sandwiches themselves were around 7 inches.  Although it was not mind blowing or life altering...I mean, it's a sandwich shop for Pete's sake!  The place was nice, clean and had a pleasant and friendly staff.  Service was quick and efficient.  The food was good.  Would I go back again? Yes.

Visited last Saturday 3/14 around 3:30PM Only time for quick and dirty review today Wait time was minimal for us, as they close at 4:00PM They were also out of a few things, but to be expected. Brisket, Turkey and Sausage were all wonderful.  Nice, natural smokiness and super flavorful! The beans were terrific as well, not a tomato based sauce, but more of a meat based broth that they were in.  Absolutely delicious!  Potato salad was good too. Service was solid, even though we were there at the end of the day, the staff seemed genuinely happy that we were there and were able to answer any questions we had about the menu. Oh they do have a regular and spicy BBQ sauce, although I would argue it's not necessary. They were good too! I will definitely return and tell others about Little Miss BBQ.  It reminds me of some of the better BBQ places in Austin, TX and certainly is some of the best I've had in Phoenix.  Lastly, understand this is a BBQ stand if you will. They do have super limited indoor seating and shaded picnic table outdoor seating.  Luxurious, compared to some super BBQ places I've been that setup in vacant parking lots! Keep up the great work Little Miss BBQ!!!

Arrived at 1:50PM on Friday, March 20, 2015  Quick and Dirty Review (Full Review Follows) Nice, brand new burger joint! (I love burgers!) Stuffed burgers make it unique to the area. Staff was courteous and responsive. Place was nice and clean, including the bathroom. Burger and fries were delicious! Everything was done in a timely fashion. Price to food ratio was reasonable and fair IMO. I will go back again and I will tell others about this place!  Full Review  I walked in just a little before 2:00 on a Friday afternoon.  I was greeted when I walked in the door. Nice touch these days! Person who helped me asked if I had ever been there before.  Upon saying it was my first time in, she offered a sample of their Outrageous Sauce on a fry for me to try.  It was tasty. Their focus is stuffed burgers and they have a number of signature selections pre-built or you can make your own (see pictures). The number of options are plentiful, another reason I'll be back.  I saw at least four others I want to try, not to mention some ideas of my own.  Thinking I'll go back with additional people next time, so we can sample different burgers! As others have mentioned, they bring out your order as it's completed.  This didn't bother me, as the fries arrived a few minutes after I got my drink and sat down.  They were piping hot and needed some cooling time, again a good problem to have IMO. The burger arrived about five minutes later, fresh off the grill. The fries were quite good and ample, somewhere in thickness between a McDonald's french fry and a steak fry.  I think they may have been lightly battered or coated with something.  It made them nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The Jalapeno Popper burger was prepared nicely. They toasted the white (brioche) bun and the stuffed burger was cooked through, which melted the philly cheese nicely.  The Jalapenos were chopped fresh as well.  Another plus in my book! My burger, fries and a drink came to $9.45 with a 10% off yelp first time visit discount on my phone. I thought even without the discount this was reasonable, considering the extra time it takes to prepare a stuffed burger. I noticed some people complained about the patty size.  The proprietors claim they use 6oz of beef in each burger and I believe that to be true.  You can't go too thick on the beef with a stuffed burger, otherwise the inside just doesn't get cooked through. Regardless, I thought the portions were ample for the price. If you are expecting In/Out or other fast food pricing, don't, while it feels like a fast food joint, I wouldn't call it one. Everything is made fresh to order, which I don't mind waiting a little extra time for. Hopefully the others who had long wait times were victims of the place being pretty much brand new. They are locally owned and not some big national franchise (yet)! I will definitely go back and will bring others with me! Keep up the great service and food!
