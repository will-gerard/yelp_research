Utterly fantastic!  Seared Ahi on a scorching hot Himalayan salt brick... Are you kidding me: makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  Duck Confit in a mesquite bean crepe... Say what?  This chef is as creative and focused on flavor as any in the state.   The wine list was well crafted, thoughtful and fairly priced.  I rarely give 5 stars but this place rocks!  Great  ambiance and outdoor seating that borders on perfect.

Thoroughly outstanding in terms of food, service and originality.  Located in a quiet neighborhood near downtown this place has it all.  Retro vibe with couches like we had in our home in the 60's, small intimate bar seating, a nice view of the kitchen and a small number of tables.  Went with my daughter and her husband and we had appetizers and small plates.  For apps we had the cheese curds and Sonoran style "pigs in a blanket" made with a local craft sausage....curds were smooth, creamy and had a mysterious spice that moved them over the top and the dogs were unique, spicy and filled with flavor.  For small plates we had the spicy shrimp that was perfectly prepared and as good as what you get in New Orleans, next we had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, utterly sumptuous.  The huge hit was the Pork Belly with a little fris√©e salad that wears perfectly prepared, sweet, savory and just plain delicious.  It may be out of the way but it's worth the trip.

From the minute you walk in the door this is a first class experience.  Ok, so it's in a strip mall but so was my favorite Italian restaurant in Jersey where I grew up.  From the hostess to the bartenders to the wait staff to the food I could not say one bad thing.  WIne list was thoughtful and fairly priced, food was well prepared and elegantly presented and the energy and ambience are upbeat and real.  If you haven't tried it yet : go!

Sushi on a conveyor belt!  Was it the best sushi I ever had...maybe not.  Was it really fresh and good...yes!  Overall this place is a blast and we had a lot of fun.  The prices were quite reasonable the service was prompt and friendly.  We will surely go back.

This was a tough experience with some really good food last Saturday night.  With much excitement and anticipation I went here with a group for a birthday.  The contract for the private room had been signed months prior and when we arrived the table was set for 16 and we had 20 guests.  To make matters worse, we only had one server and I got my first cocktail after my 3rd request more than 30 minutes after arrival.  The wife of the "birthday boy" made the mistake of breaking out in tears and asking to see the manager and I personally witnessed his rudeness.  After placing his hand just inches from her face, he told her she needed to "back off"  and told her she was out of bounds.  After many years in the restaurant business I can confidently say he needs to be fired.   The food was anywhere from good to incredibly scrumptious.  Antipasto was fabulous as were the all the first courses from chicken meatballs marsala to beef shoulder cured in red wine that was ridiculously savory and delicious.  The bone in rib eye was off the charts and the giant prawns and pasta were really good.  Our solitary waitress for a party of 20 did the best she could and reinforcements finally showed up to help about mid-way through dinner but the entire experience was severely tarnished by a bad first impression and a thoughtlessly rude manager.    As an aside, the party's host and hostess had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day and reminded them about the increase in guests and a member of our party who  was staying at the hotel and also mentioned the problem to management earlier in the day to no avail.  Someone had the audacity to bring up a contract that had been signed over a year prior that had multiple "amendments" that apparently never found their way to the manager on duty.  Sadly enough I will have to favor B&B on future Vegas visits for their excellent food and superior attitude and service.

For what it is, it's delicious and fun.  If you like crab by the pound with paper covered tables, craft beer and a fun atmosphere then this is your spot.  I had King Crab with a hot n spicy butter, boiled sausage and red potatoes, cold beer and great service.  I shall return!
