I believe this tgi Fridays is slightly worse quality food than the others as well as service. I went when there wasn't a game going on but comicon was so a bit of a crowd was warranted. We waited about 20 minutes to get in and once we were sat down the waiter left. He didn't ask whether or not we wanted drinks until 10 minutes later and brought it to us another 10 minutes later. I started timing everything when we got the water and boy did it take a while. He left the water at the table then walked away again even though we were ready to order. Another 8 minutes went by before he came back to take the order. By this time the room seemed nearly empty to me as there did not seem to be that many customers on that side. We waited a whopping 33 minutes until our food finally arrived and the guy didn't check on us in between or refill water even though we tried to get their attention. I was so hungry by the time the food came I devoured it almost instantaneously, but not fast enough to glaze over the fact that the chicken was too dry and the broccoli was overcooked. The meal was also around $17 not including tip so I did not find it worth it. It took more than an hour of waiting after being seated to get food and we were ignored most of the time. The waiter seemed apologetic afterwards but I don't think I will be back.

The sandwich is such a good deal if you get the 20" sub. I got the turkey sandwich the first time and added vinegar and oil as dressing. The turkey was very dry and needed a pastier or more liquid dressing to season but the vegetables on the sandwich were fresh and complemented the vinegar and oil well. The second time I got the Italian sausage with mushrooms. This took a while to come out but the taste was worth the wait. The sauce was a fresh tomato paste that was warm and tangy on the greasy and delicious sausage. The mushrooms were a great add since it creates a certain texture and flavor that  swirls in the mouth well. The bread both times was soft and great tasting as it is white bread. The decor and place itself are a bit drab but I think they expect people to take it out more often than not. This sandwich place is very delicious and I would recommend it.

I quite enjoy the atmosphere of this mom and pop shop. The waiters are friendly and serve attentively and the music is pleasant to listen to. Pasta nights are nice because you can get most of the pastas for under $10. You can add a salad for $2 more and it is worth it. I love the dressing it comes with. It is a tart flavor with olive oil over it and a bit of cheese. The initial meal starts with their bread which is usually warm and fresh out of the oven. It comes with a vinegarette that is just divine. The broccoli and pasta dish was quite light and did not make me feel bloated like most Italian places. I liked the veal combo as well where it came with a side of pasta and your choice of sauce. I think the veal was well done and thinly sliced to retain the perfect texture. The pasta on the side was a bit overcooked but not to the point of mushiness so it was negligible. I had a cannoli and it was pretty good. The sweetness was not too overwhelming and there was a balance of crisp to cream and chocolate sauce. The meal here seemed very light and balanced and the place is cozy.

I came here for lunch and it was packed so there was a half an hour wait but I was craving the chicken so I patiently waited the 30 long grueling minutes. The wait staff was very nice about it and came out frequently to seat people. There were outdoor seating areas that were empty that they should convert to dining spaces. When we were finally seated, the waitress was perky and ready to help. We ordered our Jar of Drank first. The koolaid was a bit warm with lots of ice and the lemonade had a crystal lite flavor to it. I ordered the 3 piece chicken with two waffles and eggs with cheese and onions and a side of grits. I do not like grits so I traded it for fries but they gave me rice instead... (must have been the loudness of the place). The chicken skin is so delicious and crisp with the perfect amount of salt. When you add their hot sauce the flavor is divine. The waffles have cinnamon and are nice and fluffy. I can't say much about the eggs and "fries" (rice) because they were pretty standard. I loved the foods they are known for but I would skip the extras. The price is not bad for the amount of food and the experience was nice.

The place is nice but the decor ordinary, the wait staff is only attentive at the beginning of the meal, when they brought the ban can first which was a plus, I got the khalbi dot sok bibimbop which came out relatively quickly but I noticed the bowl was a lot smaller than hodori's was. The food did taste good but the service is terms of bringing me water was slower. When we were done they seemed really eager to have us leave so they gave us the check right away. I ordered the tempura ice cream then and shared with my friends. It did not have chocolate drizzle like the picture but instead it was smothered in whipped cream and had two lemon wedges on the side. I was Ok with that but it is false advertising. Since it was the middle of the day on Saturday it didn't seem very packed so we stayed to talk longer but received no service after that. This place is good for eating in and leaving but not for friends who want to catch up.

We got the 24 hour buffet pass and came here for lunch. I started with a penne pasta dish that was delicious because it had a spiciness to it, I also got the pork and apples which was also quite well made. The prime rib was really tender but a bit saltier than I would like. The roast beef was too tough to cut and to chew. I did get a pot pie that tasted pretty good as well. There were clams and crab legs and both were mediocre. The crepes are pretty amazing and the fruits within are fresh. I had a variety of other desserts like the lemon tarts, creme brulee, flan, cake pops, cheese cake etc. I liked the tart and the creme brulee the best the flan and cake pops were far too sweet. This is a good buffet compared to planet Hollywood, I think it was better, and almost comparable to Caesar's since it's not the extra $25. The wait staff was way more attentive than both Caesar and Planet Hollywood and asked us how we were throughout the dining experience. The decor was adorable as well.

The place has the basics for dim sum, there are steamed pork buns, ribs, stripes, chicken feet, shumai, shrimp dumplings etc. They are all quite flavorful and standard on their tastes. The pork buns don't use a traditional bread but the bun they use taste quite sweet. The tripe is good and their other beef intestine dish is a bit salty for my taste but still acceptable. The food is average for dim sum, but it is pretty decent for dim sum in Arizona. The service is not great I had to ask 3 or 4 times for shrimp rolls and the tea refill took a while to arrive. It was pretty slow on business too so there seemed to just be a lack of workers at the time even though we went at around lunch time. I would say Sunday would probably have better service but you would have to wait for a while. I have also had dinner here and they have better quality food as well as service then.

I used to come here all the time for dinner with my family. The service is alright, but when they are busy it is understandably slow. They do check up on you when they aren't busy and food comes relatively quickly. First you get complimentary edamame, miso soup and salad, then your order comes shortly after. The baked scallop roll is warm and flavorful, the sashimi is usually fresh and the udon has bouncy noodles. The tempura is crisp and delicious as well. I've also had a wide range of their rolls and they all taste relatively good for sushi in Arizona. The all you can eat is a really good deal since you can get 3 rolls and make it up as it is only $19.99. If two people get it you can get a sashimi plate with a variety of fish.  This place is  a very good deal and pretty good sushi for Arizona.

I love crepes and the fact that this location is so convenient for me is wonderful. As you walk in there is a cute atmosphere that invokes a sense of comfort. The wait staff is quite nice but sometimes it is very busy and they forget to bring the water or take a while. I have often come at different times just to make sure it wasn't due to the crowding but the service is still subpar. I suppose they want to imitate the slow pace of paris.  Each crepe is crafted with care as all of them look fabulous and the taste is just splendid. The crepe itself is not a crispy texture like some places but a stretchy doughy consistency that I am quite fond of. The savory crepes are similar to each other except for the turkey pesto and italian. Turkey pesto is unforgivingly salty but the others seem true to their description. The sweet crepes are a delight and they have a good variety whether you are craving a lighter fruit crepe or chocolate drenched or a mix there is one for you. I enjoy the strawberry, kiwi and honey as well as the sunshine. One crepe rarely fills me though so the bill ends up being expensive since I get one of each. Coffee and italian soda here are also quite good but I wouldn't say it is to die for. All in all it is a wonderful place to sit and relax for a bit as well as enjoy a delicious warm doughy crepe.

The musical instrument museum is spectacular. There are so many exhibits to see, instruments to play and videos to listen to. When you walk in the hall is quite tall and a bit cool (probably to keep the instruments at a certain temperature) I suggest bringing a light sweater. The prices are well worth it as general admission is $20, teens (13-19) $14, and children 3+ are $10. There is also a two day pass options that seemed quite cost effective as well if you live closer to the location. The admission comes with a headset that allows you to listen to all the videos playing at the exhibits. Each exhibit has interestingly crafted lutes, guitars, flutes, pipes etc. and they all have descriptions about the culture. The videos are especially nice because they show how the instrument is played as well as a general idea of how it sounds. The instrument construction sections are pretty cool as well. There is an experience section so you can play the instruments and a gift shop to bring home the fun. Overall I enjoyed the experience of all the cultures through music.

This place is awful......  I came in not expecting anything since I hadn't seen the reviews and I was downtown for a convention so I wanted cheap food. First of all it is a fast food place so the food should be ready and usually warm. I tried to order wings (which they advertise on the banner) but they didn't have any that day even though it was earlier in the day and in the week. The people working were very lethargic and didn't want to be there (who would?). In leu of the lack of wings I decided to get 1 slice of pizza and a salad which was a combo for around $9. The salad came with either a vinegarette or ranch and I chose vinegarette. It was a goopy texture and the taste was so sweet it was like molasses. The salad was so bland and had basically nothing on it. The only hints of flavor came from the onion and tomato. The pizza had rubbery cheese and it was slightly cooler than room temperature. I did not have a good experience here and I do not think I will be coming back.

Snoh is one of the most well established Asian hang out spots I have ever stepped foot in. There is boba, shaved ice, shaved ice and boba and their new brock toast. The variety of flavors is decent for boba but the shaved ice is really what makes the place special. The snoh has the fluffiest texture and each flavor such as thai tea, matcha, mango and cream. The toppings just add an extra pop or crunch to the cold fusion in your mouth. The ice is not too sweet so the addition of glaze creates the perfect amount of sweetness for a refreshing dessert. I recently tried their brick toast which is the most delicious way to get diabetes if you are into chocolate and banana with vanilla ice cream.         The vibe is quite chill and their music selection is alright, at least it's not too annoying or loud.  The staff is friendly and the service is fast except for the brick toast which takes them 10 minutes but it is worth it. Overall I recommend the place for just a chill hangout as there are games and such in the back and interesting decor that is comfortable to relax in.

I've been here a few times now but every experience I've had has been excellent. The service is fast and friendly but not bothersome. They really understand that as diners we are trying to enjoy the food without too much interruption. The menu is not too expansive but the few things they have are done quite well. I like to start off with yellowtail sashimi. With 8 pieces costing $12 it's a pretty good deal. Additionally the fish was a nice temperature and tasted fresh and tender. Each roll that I've tried has also been a delight. First off the Oh My God roll has a smokey eel flavor that is not overwhelming but compliments the rest of the ingredients well. The H3 has a spicy kick that most japanese restaurants don't have, it might be a korean thing. The caterpillar roll is melt in your mouth from the fresh avocado to the eel. I've had the chance to try the mango crunch roll which has a sweetness to it mostly from eel sauce, the mango I found was a bit tart and made the roll a delightfully light flavor. The oasis is covered with cucumber instead of their signature purple rice, it's cooling and refreshing for summer, but I'm not a huge fan of that much tuna. Overall I would recommend this place to anyone that has a standard for raw fish.
