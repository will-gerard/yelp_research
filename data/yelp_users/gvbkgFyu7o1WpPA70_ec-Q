This is a very good Korean place to eat.  It is just a little on the pricey side if you get a drink or two and also eat a full meal.

Great bagels and sandwiches. Wonderful people there also. For the first check in we got six free bagels. They are great. Very fluffy compared to most other places where it feels like your jaw is giving out chewing up one. Their bagels are good both toasted and not.   Recommended for sure.

To know me is to know what being a foodie truly is. I just so happened to be in the area and we hungry and this place turned up in my search results. Being that I live diners and the reviews were good, I thought I would give it a go. All I can say is WOW! . I love the food! . I was in search for breakfast and I found it. Man did I ever.   This is the kind of Diner I have been looking for since moving here! I had one of their specials that came with 3 eggs, double bacon (you can get half bacon and half sausage or all sausage or all bacon), hash browns, choice of toast, and since my son was with me we added one of their Belgium waffles as we were sharing. Everything was wonderful. It was way more than enough for both of us and I am looking forward to going back again and often.

It is a small place and on busy nights do takeout. Great food for sure.  I have not tried a dish that wasn't good. Their food is prepared with care. We eat here often and always take extra home.

If I could put negative stars I would. Setup an appointment a week in advance and the guy doesn't bother to call or say I'm going to be late. He just doesn't answer his work. Pay attention to the bad reviews. Do not do business with this guy.

These guys are top notch and very accommodating. They worked me right in after a different tint company I had an appointment with just ditched without a call. Not these guys. I drove up and they got right on it. Excellent work and I highly recommend them. I have already setup an appointment for these guys to follow up with me to do our home windows.

This place is an absolute gem.  My son loves Pad Thai and my entire family loves Thai in general, but we know good versus mediocre. We just moved from Southeast Mesa where we were close to a great Thai place and we're hoping to find a local spot that was good. We Yelped up this location and less that a mile from our current abode we found some delicious food and very friendly staff. We ordered the mixed fried rice, some Penang curry and an order of Pad Thai. All of the dishes were delicious. We can't wait to go again.
