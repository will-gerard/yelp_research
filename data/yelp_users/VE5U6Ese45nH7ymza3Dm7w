I have been coming here for years! Owners Jimmy and Demi are amazing!! Top notch products and services. Leah gives best pedicure! Would never waste my money anywhere else!

I thought this place was great.  I am super picky about my nails and even though it has bad reviews I decided to try because of convenience to my office.  Soloman did a great job and said if I messed them up or one broke come back and he would fix for free.  They were super friendly!

Make sure you understand what a "bottomless" soda is before you order a soda. asked for a soda and he brought "bottomless" which for 2 ppl was $27! This place is such a rip off. Then told the waiter we wanted to dispute our tab and he said he'd send a manager over and then we went and ran the card. Not the sharpest tool in the shed! They need to train people to explain how policies and also in customer service. The manager Jamie was very nice and refunded some of the charges but my overall experience is not good. I will definitely stick to the smaller comedy clubs.
