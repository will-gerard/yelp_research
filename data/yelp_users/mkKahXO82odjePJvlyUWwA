Went to Breadcrafters with my sister and we both got sandwiches and a fruit tart to share. We both enjoyed our food a lot but it was the bread that made the food. I loved the fruit tart. I wish I could have tried all of their sweet treats. But good place to eat but my only complaint was that it was so small. Like only 7 tables... Oh well amazing food!

Love this place. Awesome sushi hour during the weekdays. I'm a regular and have never been disappointed in my 7 years of coming here.

I have been going to Avina's for years with my parents. Their food is home made and delicious. The owner is either out on the floor taking orders or in the back helping with the cooking. My favorite dish is the Avinas special cat fish. They have great egg rolls, both spring and summer. Every trip there makes me feel like I'm in Vietnam.

The staff here is amazing. Sarah was a great waitress. Kind, friendly and attentive.  But the food... the food... was terrible. I started off the minestrone soup. Classically a vegetable broth with small pasta throughout. this was literally broth with vegetables. No real flavor or seasoning.  I ordered the bolognese and literally could not stomach more than a few bites. It tasted like dog food served with undercooked (and I like al dente) pasta.   I was very disappointed with my meal but once again, the service is the only reason I gave any sort of rating.
