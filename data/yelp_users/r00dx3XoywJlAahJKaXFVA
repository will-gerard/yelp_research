Joey's was nice family feeling good Italian food. I came for a few brews while waiting for my wifey to get her hair done at the Avalon Salon school down the way from here.   He recommended I try the kronenbourg and it was so perfect I had another, chomping on yummy bruchetta with a mixed green salad thrown in.   To finish it off I had a canoli and cappuccino which together was just wow. About $30 for all that, hmm sure a bit pricey but not unreasonable considering the place seemed to have a great handle on what they were doing, and did it right.  Great Italian vibe, unassuming and friendly, like you would expect in a neighborhood New York place, though it calls itself a California Bistro.   I shall return for dinner sometime soon! Kudos to Emily my waitress and the guy behind the whole works for keeping up on everything during my visit.   If you are looking for cheap grub this is not it, but if you have a desire for authentic Italian in the area, I can imagine no better destination. Impeccable, caring service and not rushed.  Parking is plentiful, easy access from Bell and 7th. No WiFi but I was able to watch the game at the bar, they have  few TVs around though def this is for the people and the eats.   If you have well behaved kiddos they would certainly be welcome, though also romantic enough for couples, and bright enough for casual dinner and drinks with the guys or friends after work.

Most expensive breakfast in town. $160 when all was said and done!   This isn't because of the food, it's because of that awful gift shop that just has so many things we absolutely loved and dresses for my wife, jars of goodies, candies, toys, knick-knacks, rocking chairs, games, oh for the joy of stuff stuff stuff!  We'll be back, Cracker Barrel, and will use your plentiful parking, easy access off the road, to have more yummy food and buy more goodies afterward!   Men (or equivalent other half thereof), guard your wallets! :)

Greeted by the pleasant staff as we walked in,  no waiting and sat to our booth, ordered drinks and then introduced to the manager  Bruce, a great start to our first time at Red Lobster.  Our first taste was the legendary biscuits which were soft on the inside and crunchy toasted on the outside, with a hint of cheesy herby goodness, brought to us by the handsome and mild-mannered Brandon. He would take good care of us throughout the evening.   We got half a dozen steamed oysters on the half shell, a bit dinky but the horseradish was amazing. I'd go for the raw ones next time and hope for bigger oysters.  Next came the salad which was your basic Caesar, however nicely shaved slivers of parmesan on top which was a nice flavorful touch, the dressing was light and not too salty.  I should pause to say they have a pretty extensive drink menu for those who like to get their foofoo fruity, margarita or tropical drink on, you are covered, as well a decent compliment of beers, wines, and standards along with virgin non-alchy drinks and smoothies.  We got the Ultimate Feast and split it, it did not disappoint, the lobster tail, crab legs and fan tail ( aka scampi ) were great! Along with it came some yummy wild rice pilaf and mashed potatoes and a compliment of sauces for each thing, buttery sauce, seafood cocktail sauce and seared lemon which were well paired. Everything cooked just perfect.   Would have finished it off with an awesome desert but wanted to go for froyo so off we went. Total was around  $50 which ain't bad, we could have easily doubled that with all the yummy stuff on the menu.  Red lobster did good. We enjoyed it and will be back for more soon! That's a rare 5 stars from me.

Excellent, friendly service by knowledgeable staff.   We arrived just before 8 when there was plentiful parking.  Though we made an appointment online, they are not needed for Visas.   After a short wait, our documents were processed by Nancy who gave us clear direction how to proceed and warm, welcoming  smiles.   We went back home to retrieve some documents we forgot, by the time we were back my Visa was ready and pasted into my USA passport.   The waiting area was air conditioned and cool while it was 110 outside.   They have a number system of 12 windows, queued by first to last arrival, common sense, get your place in line and follow along.   The facility has nice HP laser copier/printers (not for you!) and Canon T3i cameras (they use) to take your picture. Of course this isn't a FedEx copy shop or photo studio.   Tip for everyone: Get your pics taken before hand, and all papers filled out and ready for your visit. Come at 8 when they first open.   All the info you need is online and clear to understand. Don't call, not needed. Come in person. They do an awesome job here.   Many thanks to Consulate General of Mexico!

Though I've had some decent food at Texas Roadhouse out of the area, this location, unfortunately, did not do well the several times I went there for lunch or dinner.  Service was great, or at least our waitress had an amazing nice shaped arse which made up for some of the otherwise poor dining experience.   On to the food - wifey ordered a steak and it was so tough she couldn't chew it. We were going to send it back but it took them too long to notice -- on the plus side, they took it off our bill and apologized. Thanks +1 star for that.  There are TVs on, not loud. There is music, also not so loud, it's just overall loud as hell  and I don't mean because of the constant barge of yeehaws or call/response for birthdays.  I don't know if it's bad acoustics or what, but if I were a sound engineer I'd map that place out, then do something to dampen the noise.  I ordered a ribeye, medium rare. On the plus side, it was cooked perfectly. However, although these are hand picked and carved, I guess they cut corners better than meat, or maybe the chef missed this was about half fat which I had to trim off, along with stringy parts I wasn't able to cut.  Evidence of a bad slice left for the waitress to see, she got a good look but stayed silent as she removed my plate at the end. Not a question "Did you enjoy your steak? Was it cooked well? Did it taste ok? Was it a bit too fat?" None of that. -1 star there.  Drink menu has a few fruity cocktails and margaritas, beer selection awful unless you like commercial lager/pilsner in a frozen glass, then go ahead. They were out of the seasonal Sam Addams brew so Boston Lager was the thing and it tasted stale, also served in a chilled mug. I happen to like the taste of beer, don't mask it with ice cold containers please.  For a steakhouse, some darker brews compliment the meat. (Point here: Texas Roadhouse doesn't have them). Try a Guinness or a porter, really. Room temperature glass. You'll thank me. You're welcome. Every other bar in the area has at least a few locally produced ales and usually given in a proper glass. It's a science like wine, different shapes for different tastes. Keep the cans of cheap beer for hot summer days where you don't care how many or how often you drain them. Nuff said.  Parking is decent though at times odd because of the way these places are right angled along 75th, you may have to circle around or use adjacent parking for Desert Sky Mall.   Tip: They have lunch/early dinner specials so come earlier to get in on that or for when it's less crowded.  Note to management or brand owners: I really really want to like Texas Roadhouse, and not just for the cute staff. Please fix the problems with the food and the beer selection, so we can enjoy the full experience like a Texas Roadhouse is supposed to be.

Some good German brews on tap, though known for some tasty wines and fun cocktails they mix.  They have great sausages, decent German style food, not overly extravagant, though table service was excellent. Price was as I'd expect it to be. Wifey and I got the dinner for 2 for $35, I kicked back two Dunkel's and she had a delicious white wine. For desert we opted for the cake and coffees.   You can opt to sit at the bar, a table, or outside depending on weather and events going on (or lack thereof).   Clean bathrooms. Plentiful parking around the back sides of the building. It has a homey kind of atmosphere, you are among friends and relax, kudos there.  All in all a nice treat - I'd surely return and explore more of their menu and drinks! As for the authenticity of it being German, well that's like trying to describe American food, you will get something different depending on what region you are in -- it was German enough for me ;)

Close to my work, Sunday at 11am it was pretty desolate (usually this is a busy place!) so it fit the bill.  Double double animal style and Neapolitan shake.  Extra star given for fast friendly service by cute smiley people.  Prices have rose steadily over the years so I don't go as often, though I do as In-N-Out urge hits! ;)  Tip: the original SoCal locations are awesome, and outside the area places serve fairly consistent grub even if not as good...

A bit of good and bad all around -- expensive in comparison, but authentic Japanese food. Huge portions. Wifey has a tiny stomach capacity so we brought much of it home.  She took a very long time to decide due to the high prices, and we almost left, when she decided on the ribeye. A good choice, the steak was amazing and full of awesome flavor.  Though a bento box or a few rolls would have been nice, I chose tonkatsu ramen and it was good with lots of delightful goodies in the broth.  For drinks, though they don't serve alcohol you can BYOB. I asked for hot tea, and got a can of green tea soda and cup of ice.  I ordered seaweed salad, and was brought a lettuce side salad followed by the one I ordered.   Next an oyster shooter. It was $9 for one presented in a small dark bowl which arrived the same time as the main course, I paused a bit, being used to seeing them viewable in a clear shot glass. Nevertheless it was tasty.  On to the service: Before entering the restaurant we were greeted then seated quickly. Parking was surprisingly plentiful given the small lot, we lucked out and got a place near the door. Quite attentive wait and sushibar staff, all appropriate pleasantries spoken in Japanese, respectful and honoring us.  Though the room temperature was uncomfortably hot, overall nice experience.  We're on a budget so could not splurge on things we really wanted to try. Would return again at a less busy time with lower prices and less heat.

My friends took us here when we moved in, sort of an introduction to the area and wow this was the authentic stuff you want to eat, they live up to the name.  Catfish, jambalaya, wonderful sauces and things you would expect the bayou to serve up fresh like they do here.  I felt that funky mojo soul thang power-up inside me and you know it's good cookin when you get that goin' on. And the tea, have the tea. Oh yes.

Ah the triennial boob smashing for the wife.  Scheduled our appointment online the previous day, found AMPLE parking and went in, signed in at the FRONTal desk and had a short wait til she went in.  Said the staff was very informative and did her 3D scan which we got a free take home DVD (how often do you get that for a breast exam? Woo I have something to watch other than game of thrones now).  Being a guy I chuckled at that idea.  Well, all in all a great visit. Lovely staff, a short wait.   (BTW do check in when you walk in, don't just sit there like a sloth and expect to be catered to).  Goonies was playing on the TV, you know, the one with the kids and pirate ship and treasure CHEST. Sorry, enough silly references :) if you need a scan (they do more than just bewbies) I would recommend them.

Amazingly attentive, welcoming service. Can I say heartfelt? The staff made us feel as if we were longtime, cherished old friends.  Our orders were delivered timely and explained well.  The dinner was ala carte and quite expensive, $30 per person, though we know they have a booming daily buffet at $9.99 a person which is said to be quite good, which we shall return for. They also cater and do takeout. We got a menu for later ;)  Music was modern yet tasteful, Indian influenced stuff that accompanied the meal well.   Bathrooms and decor were clean, well cared for. Parking was easy, nice access to Dysart, the place is easy to spot from the road.  The wifey can't handle spice so they dumbed it down for her. My lamb dish was adequately spiced for me though. Drink choices were plentiful. Rice options and side dishes all what you would expect though I didn't notice saffron rice, maybe they don't do it or I just missed it? They have a huge menu. I will venture into more flavorful choices on our next visit.  Portion sizes were good, though maybe a bit skimpy on meat and naan considering price per plate, still had plenty of food left over which they helped us carefully pack, so can not really complain. I imagine they do vegan dishes very well.  Everything presented well, our waters were kept full and we were checked on often to ensure we enjoyed the meal and all was in order.  On the way out, the waiter even rushed half way across the restaurant to hold the door open for us and personally thank us for coming, a nice touch, and their thankfulness quite sincere. That kind of care goes a long way in my book, and sets them apart from many Indian places I've been before.  So there you have it, the India Garden. Give it a go, one of the few if not only restaurant in the West Valley of its kind and caliber.

Good ol' home cookin' and big portions. Don't expect fast food, this stuff is made by family and they might take their time, but oh so worth it. It's not pricey at all, a great bargain, super friendly staff. Ample parking even during busy times, though beware of motocity next door they don't take well to restaurant people using up all their parking (for good reason!)   If you want desert items or just crave something sweet, the giant size cinnamon rolls or little chocolate cream pie things (sorry, don't know the word...) are super tasty. I always leave satisfied. Only drawback is coffee could be a bit better, though I will take a wild guess they make it 80% good so people don't just linger all day and take up the tables while others who want to have a meal wait for a seat...   Tip from the regulars: Look at the board as you walk-in, good specials not on the menu!

$6 for 2 smaller than normal scoops. Baskin-Robbins how you have fallen, or it is just this location perhaps? Ice cream was too soft and melty... This place seemed dirty and depressed, and I feel a bit sick after eating it.   Tip: The one off Dysart is a nicer experience, go there for your BR fix if not buying it at the grocery store.

This is a fun indoor swap meet, it is almost a maze of shops, you have clothing boutiques, cell phone/accessory stores, a row of salons, barber shops, jewelry and jewelry repair stores, photo studio, t-shirts, hats, souvenirs, wedding stuff/formal wear, tailors, travel, loan, and tax services, printing and embroidery shop, is your head spinning yet? They also have food courts on either side including some wickedly good ice cream and snack/dessert stands that will fill your belly with happiness and blow your mind. Given the name and location you are in a world of handsome and lovely latinos where Spanish may be preferred but of course English is welcome. Enjoy yourselves, and if none of this stuff sounds like anything you need to buy, heck, just go walk around for the amusement of it all, it's good eye candy for the soul.

Best sushi and sake bombs, with an awesome happy hour menu (and a generous happy hour it is!) in the valley, hands down. Nuff said.   This hidden gem will fill your craving for Asian cuisine, not just sushi but ramen, Thai, and other dishes whipped up by their talented chef.  A true delight. Courteous and efficient service, love songs on the playlist to woo your love, and a fun kids menu to boot!   Easy parking, great for takeout as well.

Our home warranty called them in to fix the propane pool heater, they called us soon thereafter to schedule coming in the next day.  He was able to come out quick and fixed the issue, educating me and the wifey on how to prevent the problem from reoccurring.   Kudos to great communication and efficient, friendly service. Our rep was from Tempe though the office is Chandler.  The tech was knowledgeable about our area and the type of old heaters that came with the property. Extra points for that :) would recommend for your service needs.

Drove 20 minutes to get to the restaurant because Church's Chicken used to be wonderful.   This review is for the drive thru. Staff was super friendly though had trouble hearing us in the speaker. We drove up to the window to order.  We just started eating paleo so asked if they did lettuce wrapped chicken sandwiches instead of buns. The staff said yes they do lettuce wraps and so we ordered 2 of them with ice tea for the drink. Can't go wrong with boring basic Lipton tea, that's what we got.  I remember how good Church's chicken was as a kid so really looked forward to this.  In a few moment they gave us one box in a bag and we were on our way home.  When we opened it we find two small salty chicken strips with a small cup of chopped up lettuce on the side. To call them strips is overdoing it. These were like flattened chicken byproduct mcnuggets fried or perhaps microwaved in a thin batter.   Even with both of these there was definitely not enough meat for a sandwich and this was no wrap. My wife tasted her flat slab of mystery meat and it was pure salt.   The whole experience was completely unacceptable and we just threw the stuff in the trash. Mine looked so gross I didn't even try it.  Couldn't even give it to the dogs.  I am so sad if this is what Church's has become. I will return some day for chicken 3pc or what not and hope it's better, though my confidence is low.  Parting advice: Do not order chicken wraps.

We went here for lunch, and split a plate of appetizers along with a side of chile relleno, and were actually stuffed after that :) I had 2 beers from the tap and wifey had what I can assume was a lava flow sort of pina colada drink -- they have margaritas and you can pick your own tequila, as well happy hour Mon-Thur from 3pm-7pm, friendly staff, great decor all around, and misters around the outdoor patio if you feel so inclined. Fiesta? oh yes!   Price, say about $9 a person for food, drinks about what you'd expect. They have many more pricier options for those that want to eat more, as well a tantalizing desert menu with all the traditional faves, flan, deep fried ice cream, and so on...   Don't expect street tacos or grab and go burritos, it's not that kinda food. This is good Mexican style sit-down-and-eat restaurant grub, with a few entrees from other south american cuisine as well.

Good burritos with a lot of meat. Hot fresh chips free with your meal, freshly made salsas. Kid friendly place. Plentiful parking. Taco Tuesday specials.  Wifey had the Lazaro special burrito which had a mixta of shrimp, pork, beef   I got the plate with burrito, enchilada, rice and beans. Good comfort food.  Next time we will do just tacos, it was so much food! :)

Tl;dr - bbq meat by the pound. No frills. Good stuff.  We stumbled into this place last night after driving by several times.   The decor is rustic like a country fair. You order by the pound and get your sides or fixins further down the line, cafeteria style.  Grab some paper for a place mat, Sit at long picnic tables on metal chairs with your box of grub.  For two of us it was $40, so it ain't cheap, but if you want your texas BBQ fix, this place will surely satisfy.  I had 1/2 pound of brisket ( $6.99 ) which was super yummy and smokey, they have 3 kinds of beef brisket. Sorta dry, mushy, or cutters choice. I did choice. As someone who knows good brisket, it was done right.  Wifey ordered babyback ribs ( $7.99 x 2 ) cooked perfect for me though perhaps a bit under for her tastes, still darn good. I was fortunate to share ;)  Sides were $3.99 each, a green chili stew (whew spicey goodness with celery, tomatoes, chili's, and such) and potato salad (fairly basic Costco style though no complaints). They have bread and sauces, peppers and more in the salad bar looking area.  Drinks were a wide nice variety of local or commercial beers for $3.50 each (lots of shiner beer, I dunno why), you could get a bucket of ice to stick em in too), sweet tea, not sweet tea, sodas, etc. No glasses, no plates, this is real eatin with none of that sissy foofoo. OK they do have sissy sauce for people who can't handle the spice, though I digress...  TV's all around with sports on display and seating outside for those that want it ;) mind the roll up garage doors.  Plentiful parking in their own lot with easy in and out to the street.  Ordering is in a line, you tell them what you want, get it, then sit down wherever. They also do catering.  I hear they are known for massive baked potatoes with all kinds of trimmings, though I didn't get any of that this round.  A place to bring your out of towners or locals who crave good BBQ in a casual setting.

I strolled in early afternoon, in luck I was the only one there except for an occasional takeout customer.  Looking over the bilingual menu I knew I had found some authentic Mexican food. Surely not like Taco Bell or Chili's, who are about as far from Mexico as some politicians embracing immigrants...  When the waitress took my drink order, she was a bit confused at me asking what the difference was between the Mexicano and Americano versions of their Michelada, though was kind enough to point out the menu clearly detailed each and their respective beer choices. Mexican brews for the Mexicano, American lagers/pilsners for the Americano.   "Ah, the Cerveza?" I mused in Spanglish, laughing.  "Y Comida?" She replied.  I ordered the chimichanga with beef. She asked if I wanted red or green salsa, I said Rojo.   Though my Spanish is a bit out of practice, the lovely waitresses seemed to admire my efforts and continued to speak to me in Spanish the rest of my visit.   In awhile it came out, freshly done with fluffy Spanish rice and refried beans. Never mind the calories, this is the real deal. I can tell they dumbed down the taste for my gringo palette, though grabbed the hot sauce and salsa from my chips to kick it back up a few notches. Did the waitresses just smile, or was it something amusing on the TV? I like to think it was me.  Afterwards, the eldest of the three, who I am guessing is the mother and owner, came out to greet me, and seeing me enjoying myself had an approving nod and went back to the kitchen.  The beef was cubed and baked in a sauté, old school style. Wow, not your usual beef by any sort. There was carefully sliced avocado (not guac dip), the chimis were just the right amount of crispy texture.  Not omg the best ever meal, but good. Comfort food can be like that, it hit the spot.  The waitress in red came again by to check on me "¿todo bien?" - oh yes, it was all good. I was licking my glass and stirring up the tamarindo and spice rock which I was sure was melting away in the bottom as I kept tasting it.  I took my time and finished up my meal. "La cuenta, port favor" I asked as I went up to pay, admitting my Spanish was not so good.  She said something pleasant to me about practicing and rattled off other stuff I am not sure what it was, probably along the lines of "thank you, come again"  but who knows!  Prices may be a bit more than you'd expect for some things, but then this corner location in the southern half of Desert Sky mall must come at a premium.   I will return, surely. I left there satisfied. There was a $1 surcharge for using debit but oh well, next time cash.  For a local, family run little hole in the wall place, they've done well by me.   I hear they do breakfast, have a great seafood menu, and serve up traditional agua frescas as well. Nice.

Oh so yummy grub here.   Burgers and sandwiches that are OMFG good.  Beers, I got the sampler of 6. They nailed the Saison so I had another pint of it, the Oatmeal Stout was too low gravity (though I understand why) and the freestyle wasn't to my liking, but the others were great examples of Microbrew.  I plan on coming back and having lots more, hell maybe I can share some of my brewing knowledge with their brew folks and stuff like that!  Anyway, yeah, best damn find since I moved to Arizona, this place rocks!

His and hers mani pedi $125 with the yelp checkin 10% discount.   You could easily spend less here and still get the same lovely service, nice people, not rushed.  I'll probably not go so extravagant next time but it's been awhile so needed it. It's like I have new feet and hands now, and they feel and look great. So smooth ahh like baby skin!  Wifey got French acrylic nails with gel top coat, sparkly red polish on her toes. I of course simple clear coat on both.   Very clean shop and well appointed, family run business. We were just driving by and decided to stop in, so glad we did.
