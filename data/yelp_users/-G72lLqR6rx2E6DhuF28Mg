The best food ever!!! Brandon is the chef to request he puts on a great show. The steak was so good... It melted in my mouth. Also the shrimp is great. Service was amazing and they were fun to talk with. Give this place a shot you won't be disappointed.

I just had the worst experience of my life.  I have been a member for 6 months but my 1st time going was tonight. I was told that I can bring a friend when I come so I brought my friend... he is the one that motivated to go.  When I get to the desk they tell me that he can not come in. Brandon the manager was very rude and condescending. I asked to talk to his manager, Pat another manager called her and she would not talk to me.  This took about 5min and then all the sudden the police show up and tell us to leave. Brandon did not even ask me to leave he just called the police and had them tell us to leave.  I have  never had the police called on me. Officer Stranger then took my info and treated me like I was a criminal and literally escorted me and my friend out. If Brandon asked me to leave I would have left. I will be canceling my membership and praying to never have an experience like that again.  Absolutely no customer service and apparently don't care.

I came to the keg with a group of friends. I've never had a bad meal here but tonight was not great. Three of them got steak and loved it but I got salmon and it was awful! Super dry and over cooked. Also the bell peppers were fermented. The manager came out and apologized and removed the meal from our tab. The manager was very professional and nice. Other than those two things everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. I would recommend this restaurant to a friend but tell them to stick with a steak.

Great place to come to watch a game. Tons of TVs with every game on. Great food and drinks. Awesome service. Food came out fast and was delicious. Lots of options for food. Was seated quickly on a Saturday night.

This is a great place to play softball for kids and adults. It has great concessions with lots of options for meals. The concessions is indoors with a nice bar. It also has a playground for younger siblings. The umpires are great and management truly cares about the needs of your team. The batting cages are really nice as well.  Another great thing is that when you pay to get in they give you a token that is good for $1 off any food or beverage. It is a great place to bring your family!

Bad night for service at BJ's. I ate here with 6 of my friends after they all got their food mine did not come out.  I figured it would be out in a sec... But no after 20 min of waiting I had to track down my waiter to ask about my food.  Only to be told by her I did not order anything.  Me and everyone I was with we're 100 percent positive I did order. The waitress was rude and not helpful and tried to make me feel dumb. Nothing worse than being treated like that in front of all my friends.  Once again horrible night for BJ's

Worst service ever I have a few business accounts here and waited in the drive threw line for 30min then decided to go inside.  The wait was just as long inside.  The business teller was not nice and was not helpful. Horrible experience for a loyal customer.

We showed up at 8:56pm and they close at 9pm... They were very nice and still served us.  It was a great late night treat. The employees were really nice and did not make it a big deal when we ordered just before closing.  It's something I would recommend nothing to compare it too.  Really good healthy treat.

Good food l got the breakfast burrito called the California Big Daddy burrito.  I liked it a lot cool place. It's a hole in the wall type of place but really nice and clean.  Everyone was really nice. We will be back again. Also when we checked in we received 10% off our meal so if you try it its worth checking in.

Great service and food. They are always really nice. Their breakfast is my favorite!  Try their endless French toast it's the best. I also like their omelets. The American is my favorite. There are options for everyone. A good variety of treats. Their orange rolls are delicious. I haven't had something bad here.
