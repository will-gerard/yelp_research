This was the last place on earth I expected to have the best sushi experience of my life, but it happened. The only reason it gets 4 stars is because it's not something everyone's gonna be able to duplicate.  See, I like sushi without crap. No avocado, no cream cheese, no mayonnaise-based BS sauce. I like raw fish, vegetables, and the occasional citrus. I'm not going to Ra for a reason, basically. When I explained all of this to the waiter (who was hobbling around like James Caan in Misery), he told me to order the Heaven on Earth roll. I did it, sans avocado, and found a new favorite, instantly. They were also very amenable to my request for slivered onions soaked in ponzu sauce as a topping for my salmon nigiri. If you haven't tried that, btw, then do it. If you're allergic to salmon, then you did some bad shit in a past life.  The squid salad seemed a little off. I don't know what it is about it, but I've definitely had better, and it's not something I think I'll be ordering again here.  The Island Poki is delicious, but comes served as a salad with leaves, so I always feel bad about the waste if I'm by myself, and giving it to a date results in mixed results. Poki and lettuce shouldn't be mixed, I think.  The prices are reasonable (for sushi in AZ), about $35 w/tip to a pretty waitress (yes, that makes a difference) for Salmon Nigiri, HoE roll and a hand roll of spicy tuna with hot tea.  I've been for the oft-praised happy hour here, and while the price is good, the sushi is unremarkable.  All in all, this place has done me right, and I know I'll be returning.

I haven't been here in a while, and I don't remember names, but I do remember that a group of us came in and more or less got sat immediately as we chose what we wanted. The artist didn't so much as blink when I told him what I wanted, which tells me that this place knows custom work very well. Yeah...mine's the foot.

I fucking love this place so much. SO MUCH. Possibly more than Fry's Electronics.  I can't find ANYTHING I want here, technically, but I could probably order it. To this day I still haven't tried all of the beers I want to, and I've been going for a long time playing beer nerd. Mix n match your 6-pack! Their liquor and wine selections are absurd, and even though I don't drink that stuff, I certainly appreciate its existence.  The aisles are skinny, so when two people pass there can be a crush, but rubbing up against someone elses girlfriend is something of a hobby of mine.  The staff is very, very knowledgable and helpful. I've been out and seen Bill and had a few drinks. Greg is cool, willing to talk to you about anything business related, assuming he's not too damn busy.  They always have amazing specials. They ran a special last year sometime on "Otter Head" for maybe $15/12 pack of big bottles. The stuff was delicious, and I found later that normally that stuff is only sold to bars for way more expensive prices. Shiner 6-packs are (last I checked) on sale for $6.99 and Session 12's have been $9.99 since the beginning of eternity, I think.  If you want good beer, or good prices, or weird liquor bottles...go to TOPS.

This place has something for everyone - from mexican, to traditional english, greek and indian. The food is more than filling, the price is very reasonable for what you get, and the staff is friendlier than most places I've been. They serve good beer, and serve $3 car bombs all the time - if you don't like the food, it's easy to drink until you do. It's not very spacious, but that adds to the charm - you may spend up to 15 minutes waiting for a 2-top, but I've never really minded the wait. The soundtrack is better than any you're going to find - I recently ate my Bangers and Mash while listening to Clarence Carter - Strokin'. This quickly devolved into a singalong for several of us, something I would be surprised to find out happens quite often here. I've heard some people say that their pasties aren's as good as other places, but I doubt that these others have the variety and consistent quality that the Cornish has. The salads served here are of exceptional quality as well.  The only problem I've come across here is that the pasties are pre-made, meaning that special requests (no mushrooms, extra meat, etc) cannot be honored. Usually this does not present a problem, but it is something to be aware of.

Screw this place. Seriously.  If I'm going to TB, I'm 90% of the time doing drive-thru. If I don't have the time to respect my body, I don't have the time to sit on plastic chairs and listen to top 40 garbage, either. Both times I've been to this particular restaurant, I got held up for an excessive amount of time behind a female who so charmed the drive-thru personnel that I had to wait an extra 10 minutes. The first time I had to fight off a horde of angry ASU sophomores who took exception to the trollop who cut in front of us on foot and got service. This time, I decided to share it rather than cause trouble. Take that, class of 2012.

The staff is always down, the beer is always cold, and the haircuts can't be beat. Only place I know that includes a straight razor and hot shaving cream w/every haircut, and as long as you're clear as to what you want, you'll get it.  I only got a $13 tattoo on $13 dollar tattoo day, but my understanding is that the work done here is well done.  Their pomade is a bit expensive, but you absolutely get what you pay for.  Oh - one thing. You're gonna get hair in your beer. If you've never had hair in your mouth, then you have bigger problems than a little fuzz in your brew, if you know what I'm sayin'...

Mr. G's gets 5 stars because I'm rating it for what it is - this isn't a House of Tricks, this is a Native New Yorker. It's a bar/restaraunt combo with great specials, great food, and the most personal and friendly service I've ever seen. The proprietor, Larry, has made me feel at home like I've never felt at home in any establishment, and I've been a regular at quite a few places before. Every employee is friendly and they always have smiles on their faces. The food is made with care, and everything tastes home-made. Sundays, I'm here from 10am until football's over, and the atmosphere is great. Several TV's all over the place are showing at least parts of every game shown, so you miss nothing. The main screen can hop around based on the action or the prevailing opinion on the best game on. When football isn't on, Larry will hand you the remote - the channel usually ends up on comedy central, but it's not a rule. Combine all of this with long hours of operation, free wifi, and a number of 2-tops, this place is great for sports fans, couples, friends, students...anyone who needs a place to be. Mr. G's is Cheers 2.0.
