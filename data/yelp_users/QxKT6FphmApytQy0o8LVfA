This place is wonderful, they have a great wine list and the food has always been great. sometimes the wait is long but it is always worth it. ..  Kinda tucked away in a neighborhood and very cozy little joint and the serive is always wonderful great place for a first date, everyone should try this place at least once.

To whom it may concern,    Imagine my shock, surprise and extreme disappointment arriving at class this morning at 645 am to find my favorite trainer Jesse O was no longer working at the OTF in Paradise Valley.    I am truly at a lost to think of any reason they would let someone go that is so upbeat, friendly, knowledgeable and encouraging. I can only speak for myself when I say that for the first time in my life how comfortable and at home Jesse made me feel about going to the gym. I have tried every diet and hired many trainers and it never seems to make a difference. I just did not enjoy going to the gym at all. I was always waiting to get the workout high and it never came. However, when I joined OTF and took Jesse's class I am pretty sure that I found my place, the music, the workout, and Jesse's energy made me not only want to come back every day but I wanted to bring all my friends.    Now that Jesse is no longer with OTF Paradise Valley I can no longer in good conscious continue to go back to that location or recommend it to any of my clients or friends.     Christian James
