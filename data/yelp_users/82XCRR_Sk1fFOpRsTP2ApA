The ribs were delicious!!  Finally a place that the sauce was so good that I would buy a bottle.  The sides too me were nasty (potato salad and cow beans) .  I would buy ribs from here and go to Mrs.Whites for the sides to make the perfect meal.

I love this place.  Frozen Margarita's are the best and they do not short you on alcohol at all.  Love the chips and salsa and the best item I think is the fish tacos.

I placed an order at the bakery for an office affair.  The next day I arrived to pick it up and they didn't have the order.  It was in the book they used and some how was not seen.  The ladies behind the counter were so apologetic.  We sat over at Starbucks and waited. Within 20 mins or less the decorated cake arrived.  The lady's name was Reggie.   I understand that everyone makes a mistake, it is how you handle it is, what I am looking for.  Safeway has always been good with customer service but this took it to the next level.  Even though their is not a Safeway in my neighbor only near my place of business.  I will start doing my grocery shopping on my way home.

Being from Philly this shop wouldn't be open.  It is ok for Phoenix but a true Philadelphian knows a good cheese steak when they eat one.  There is barely any meat in the sandwich, little to no seasoning, the condiments are plenty by they don't  make up for the lack of substance of the cheese steak.

The food was 2 stars.  We ordered a chopped salad with a processed chicken breast with grill marks and bacon cheeseburger.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the burger was good.  Ordered alcoholic drinks which were just nasty.

WOW , what a nice surprise.  I thought the music was great.  First time customer and didn't know what to expect.  The food was great.  Definitely will be a return customer.

The service is so slow.  Short staffed.  The lady at the register is very nice and really tries.  They have only 1 person making drinks at any given time and in the morning it is horrible,  Only store in the area.  Avoid!!  Lunch time is even worst.

I have had the take out (fish tacos), it was delicious.  I definitely will be dinning in and sampling more of what they have to offer.  I would like to say to the negative reviewers, GET A LIFE!!

I like the office staff and Dr. Harter.  Nothing but polite and fast.  Dr. Harter doesn't talk down to you or gives you lectures.  I like the fact she is very detail orientated.  She works with whatever is her health issues and come up with options and not just do costly test on you for money.  I have been in AZ since 2008 and I have finally found my primary doctor.  I recommend her to my mom and she is pleased as well.  Love the fact if you register on her website you have all your health history, treatment and prescription history at your finger tips.  No unnecessary office appointment to get a co-pay out of you to get information.  I am a fan!!
