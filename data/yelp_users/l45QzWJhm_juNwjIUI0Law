I wish that I could give less than one star! I went here after buying a groupon, I tried to schedule and was told that they could not get me in for a month, my deal would've been expired by then but they let me use it anyways which I thought was cool until I went in.  I had never had one of these treatments before but I eat a lot of red meat  and want to get healthy so my wife bought it for me. The technician said that everything was going well during the treatment but nothing came out  during or afterwards except water.  After the session I walked out and the tech went into hardcore sales mode, she said that because of the information that I had provided at I would need to come back at least 5-10 more times to really get the full effect. This would have been about $6-700 at this point, instead i said that I would be happy to buy one more session to see if anything would happen

This place is great, from the cheesesteaks to the pizza everything is good! Anyone that is complaining about attitude is clearly not from the east coast nor has ever visited the east coast...go to Philly and see if you don't get a little attitude in a restaurant...I'd be offended if I didn't get my meal with a side of attitude!   People need to stop being so sensitive...
