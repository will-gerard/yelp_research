Service was okay, but like most breakfast spots the wait between getting seated and ordering the food/drinks was longer than I'd prefer.  The food was decent. However, the biscuits were undercooked as well as the hash browns being too soft for my taste. The benefit of coming here is that its open 24 hrs. Nothing else around the area was open at 5:30 am.

Our hungry party of 6, looking to be wined and dined Vegas style, were thrilled at being able to get a late night reservation via our bartender at Parasol Down in the Wynn.  What started out well, ended with two words....very disappointing.   The single biggest problem was that it took way too long to get everyone's food. Two of us opted to splurge and go for the ultimate dining experience ordering the special Top Chef menu selections.  You would expect the Bravo Top Chef Menu @ $175 per person to blow us away right?  I wanted so badly for each dish to reach the Top Chef mark and be better than anything I've had the pleasure of savoring before, but it just never took me there.    As each course was brought out, I could see the anticipation of the rest of our party, but because it was portioned for 2 we could not share the wealth so to speak.  Instead everyone else got filled up on bread and drinks by the time their entrees were served. We'd been promised "gifts of the Mediterranean", but at the end of the night it turned out to be the longest, most expensive journey on our quest for food perfection. It did not live up to the Vegas hype.    I don't know who to blame for a lackluster and well below par Las Vegas dining experience.  Initially, there wasn't going to be any compensation for having our group of 6 wait for two plus hours for the main courses, but after speaking to the manager they comped 4 meals and only charged us for the 2 Top Chef menus.    There were too many courses to mention and only a couple of stand out dishes.  Was the food fresh? Yes. Were the dishes authentic? Yes.  However, far too few pluses and several irking moments make it highly unlikely that we would return or recommend this restaurant when there are so many other great options to choose from.

Late night dining options in the Cosmopolitan led us to Blue Ribbon.  The casual environment made it easy to get into the groove of sake and sushi sampling.  We were pleasantly surprised by the variety of retro sounds playing for patrons. 15 minutes into our meal our table was ready to get up and start boogying down!   Our server was spot on with his recommendations, some of which we never would have selected.  The bone marrow was different, but very tasty. The tuna and hamachi sashimi choices were mouth watering. Next came the spicy tuna roll and a roll wrapped in cucumber which was outstanding. The fried chicken was supposed to be one of their best dishes and it was! So light, crispy, juicy and with the perfect amount of spice.  The Red Dragon Sake and the unfiltered Sake (can't remember the name) were the best that we've ever had.  Be willing to dish out for these people.  The cocktails were top notch as well.    It turned out to be a perfect late night start for our first night in Vegas.  We will definitely come back to this restaurant next time we are in Vegas.

Cute spot and a nice happy hour. It's located above a restaurant and has a beautiful view from the seating on the patio. The bar opens up to the outside patio. I thought it was a nice balance of lounge and patio with a few TVs for those interested in watching a game. There's a gorgeous fireplace with a few outdoor sofas at the center of the patio. As for the food and drinks, they were good. I enjoyed the fish tacos. Service was great as well. They also have free valet  parking when you drive in. Nice touch.
