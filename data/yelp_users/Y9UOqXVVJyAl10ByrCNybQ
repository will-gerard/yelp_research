Lame company. Lengthy windows. Who really has time to stay home from 8am to 2pm waiting for them. Plus, they were super late past that six hour waiting period. Crappy service as well. Don't recommend. Secretary is rude, also. Never again.

Let me just preface by saying that I am very picky about my bagels and bagel shops. I used to work at a wonderful shop with great bagels back in the day. It's been hard to find a good bagel in the valley since.  My husband and I were in the mood for some bagel sandwiches. After being disappointed with the bagel shop selections located around us, we were determined to try to find "the one". After scoping out Yelp, seeing it was close-by and had great reviews we decided to try Lox, Stock & Bagel.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted by Patrick, Michelle and staff I knew we hit the jackpot. They were so personable and friendly, honored our Yelp 6 free bagels without question and were super patient with our large order.  As for the menu, lots of selection! Our food arrived in the right amount of time AND the whole wheat mixed bagel is nothing short of incredible!  Loved the chill, comfy atmosphere. (although, I'm not going to lie--the big mirrors on the wall need to go!)  We will definitely be back--with our 3 1/2 year old, since there was plenty of kid toys to keep him busy while we take our time eating.   Can't wait to try one of the bagels we brought home for breakfast tomorrow morning!

Honestly, I'm not sure why people are rating this location so low. I've never had a problem at this shop & I actually think all of the women who work here are very friendly (when you make the effort to get to know them). It's a kid consignment store, not a church gathering. Also, I'm thinking people might me confusing rude-ness with just plain busy employees. This shop is slammed--at all hours. Slammed because so many others like it. If you are familiar with second hand shopping you should know that some days you find winners and other days you walk out with nothing. As a seasoned thrift/consignment pro (snort!), I believe you have to go often to find the good stuff. As for Tiff & the ladies--keep it up!   Also--you can't expect tons of $$$ when consigning clothes. Don't take the cash,cheapskates, take the credit and re-use the money for the next size needed for your munchkins. If you don't like the amount you are offered, you DO have an option to donate to mamas less fortunate than you.   /rant

Small nail shop that can feel crowded really quickly. Everyone there seemed nice enough, although they don't necessarily go above and beyond to gain new clients. They seemed to show much more favoritism toward regulars. It was my first time stopping in. They quoted me $30 on the phone & said they could take me right away. (Which they did, but with exceptions) I was sat at a manicure station, only to have my manicure rushed-so much that my massage, wait.. What massage? Then I was ushered over to a pedicure chair to just sit. No soaking feet, no chair massage, no instruction. My nails didn't even have polish on them yet. I soon realized that I was moved because a regular had stopped in. All of a sudden my nail tech, who had the personality of a rock, was now super bubbly. After waiting for about 5-7 minutes, a man came over & took off my existing polish. Then left me again. At least I now was able to soak my feet. Finally a completely different nail tech came over and finished up my pedicure. Which was mediocre at best.   To make a long story...well long, I guess. The final result is: don't go here if you want to relax, or get your money's worth. (My total ended up being $40 for mani/pedi combo--much different than I was quoted). Was it $30 worth? Yes. $40? Not so much. Go here if you are awful at polishing your own nails. That was their best (and sadly, only) feature.

Jeanette is what I've been searching for quite some time! She is definitely doing what she loves & it shows through in her skills! I've only had the privilege of her waxing my eyebrows (will absolutely get a facial before long!), but the attention to detail--it's perfect!  She is so awesome at listening to what you want. I tend to like my brows on the thicker side and she listens, while throwing in her expertise, and delivers! She usually can get me in quickly and is very reasonably priced. I highly recommend Jeanette.

After using this location as our eye care specialists for the last three years, my husband and I finally decided to call it quits.   They had three years to impress us--never have they done so. The staff (depending on the day/month/year) can range from completely unprofessional to outstanding. Unfortunately, they change so often that you are never quite sure what kind of help/service you will receive. The doctor herself seems nice enough, but you spend about 5 minutes with her that it's really hard to built a client/patient relationship. (She comes across as if she could care less to, anyway.)  This last visit, my husband and I had back to back appointments. We both took about 30 minutes each--totally reasonable. When it came time to pay and order contact lenses & new glasses frames--the process took over an hour. That's just absurd! Even after all that waiting, I didn't leave with a receipt, new contact lens or glasses.  I was told in two days, I would be emailed the receipt, confirmation of my contact lenses purchased and once she had figured out the cost of my new glasses lenses--the price.   I called five days later to have them email my receipt and my rx's. Looks like it's time to find a new optometrist. Sorry 20/20, you had three years of chances.

I really want to like this place. I do. I've also given it about seven different chances--every time hoping that it will be the time when I scream "This places rocks! I'm coming back for sure!". But, unfortunately, I think today was the last time I'll spend/waste my money here.   The major issue I have with Which Wich is that they don't follow through well with their theme/gimmick--what they so that sets them apart from any other sandwich shop. It's this cute idea that simply falls through--every time! You go in, pick a brown paper bag of the sandwich you want, use a sharpie to check off the various ingredients you want on your sandwich, pay, wait for your sandwich which then is inside of said brown paper bag. Cute idea right?! Well, if I spend the time to check off ingredients and it's very simple to follow-- why is it they can never get my order correct?!  No joke. Every time my order is wrong, sometimes my son's as well. It's silly--and frustrating. (Especially since they are pricey for a quick/ non-gourmet sandwich shop.)  Slow service, horrible parking and can't follow check boxes. I've finally given up. Maybe it's just this location???

Like any parent, I need a place to drop my kid off for various reasons--doctors appts, sudden emergencies, and the much needed break.   I've been so pleased with Daydreams! I have been bringing my son there for just shy of two years. Never once have we had a problem, never once has my son not wanted to go or said anything negative about it.   From about the second or third time we went, the staff recognized us. They take great care of my son, he enjoys going and I feel safe leaving him there.  Very clean, comfortable with lots of fun things for the kids to play with while you are out and about.   Will continue to take my kids there and enjoy the comfort and convenience of Daydreams!

Interesting experience to say the least. I can't say I've ever done anything like this. I was super excited to try it, especially after my friend raved about it & gave me a gift card for my birthday. Only, I had wished I enjoyed it as much as she did. :(  It was really smelly in my pod. I'm not sure if it was urine or the Epsom salts, or what... It was really off putting. I was hoping they would put some sort of essential oil in there to assist in relaxing you, but unfortunately not.  It feels really small in there, not in a claustrophobic kind of way, but you really can't stretch out. I'm only 5'6--so I honestly didn't think that was going to be a problem. I kept banging into the sides, even when I stayed still. Kinda ruins the vibe a bit.   Also, by the time you are 20 minutes or so from being done...the water gets SO cold!! I was chilly & had to step out of the pod to get under warm water from the shower. Such a bummer.   The decor is a little cheesy--I mean lawn chairs while you wait?! :/  Anyway, I will say I did get some very few moments of serenity when I wasn't bumping into the walls, or trying to forget about the smell, and before the water got cold.  Kind of a bummer experience. Hope you have a better float if you make the decision to try it out.

A manager did contact me & provided a "do-over"--I did have a much better experience. I mostly think it was because I went to the TrueRest location in Scottsdale (Almost a completely different experience up there--I highly recommend that location!)

Don't forget to use the earplugs! I spaced this last time & my ears ached for a few days.
