Love this place when I'm in the area. I used to get seafood special which they haven't had lately. Now I get mahi-mahi with hummus! Very good!!

Well very disappointed in food and especially service! I was very excited to check it out as I like this type of food and it's close to my house and it got great reviews otherwise.  Waitress was kind of short & unfriendly to say the least. We ordered and I had a chicken salad. Upon commencement of eating I came upon what looked like an unwashed lettuce.. I carefully inspected it and moved it aside dismissing the possibility... Very soon after I found another piece of unwashed lettuce (romaine) right after a slight feeling of sand in my mouth, now truly inspected it - sure enough it looked like dirt that has not been washed of produce (just like when you buy loose lettuce at the grocery store); decided I had enough (I hardly got any progress on the food). I let the waitress know and she proceeded to convince me it was the salad dressing (because I guess I don't know the difference). Then as she took the plate, she said: "you should have told me sooner". WTF?? What does it even mean? I said: "no, it should have been washed!" At that point I was fed up with the unfriendliness and I kind of forcefully rebuffed her.  I haven't ordered anything aft that. They brought soup as a means of settling it all down (as I mentioned I liked the soup because my parents ordered the soup as an appetizer which they didn't like but I did so I ended up eating it). I declined but said I would take pistachio ice cream (they only had 2 on the menu - vanilla & pistachio). Well, pistachio ice cream ended up being vanilla ice cream with few ground pistachios on top of it.. I mean I don't even know what to say. When I read pistachio ice cream I expect pistachio ice cream just like vanilla or chocolate or strawberry. It wasn't worth arguing. I will not be coming back to this place and it's a shame because I really like mediterranean food.

I was looking for a "I crave sushi today" kind of place in the neighborhood and I think I found it. After reading reviews for this place I have decided to try it. I would say for me mostly what counts is food and I thought it was pretty tasty. I have only been here once and it was a take out sushi (salmon and yellowtail). Salmon was very fresh and tasty but yellowtail was just good. I would come back here, but probably as a take out again as the staff (1 waitress and a man prepping the sushi) were a bit on not very warm/friendly side. P.S. They automatically add 10% gratuity to your bill for take out... (???) Ohhkay....

I like this place. Not a true (New York) Italian place (in my opinion) but very very close. Food is very tasty especially fried calamari app. I usually stick with fish or veal (not a big pasta person) but have sneaked some from my bf's plate at it was tasty as well as my dishes have always been. We are here fairly often.

I can eat here every day! Their chicken - the way it's done - just yum! I usually get a combo - chicken/shrimp w/rice and cole-slaw

I truly enjoy this place! Everything I've tried so far was very very good. My favorite is provably the Eggplant starter which is done in olive oil (however way they do it) and comes with their (grilled?) lavash style bread for dipping. Sooo tasty! Will come back over and over!

My first time here: I was very satisfied with my experience here. I had a regular pedicure done with some flowers painted on my toes.  I found the place clean, staff friendly. They have sort of a menu for pedi with clear spelled out services and prices.  My tech (Michael) was very meticulous. I didn't feel like a mill type of place where the next one is all that matters. He took his time and was careful with cutting cuticles and working with my toes.  Pedi chairs are newer, comfy and have massages in them. I also received a below the knee and foot massage - seems to be included in the regular pedi as some have stopped doing in the past.  Over all great experience and I will be back!

Was looking for something to eat for lunch that's tasty and healthy. Found this place on Yelp (it's fairly new) and decided to give it a try. Overall I would come back again. However, my personal opinion is that if you're a true New Yorker or an east coaster with large italian population this place can hardly be considered italian eatery. May be my idea of italian is just different.  Good points: (I had grilled salmon over salad) - pretty tasty, fresh ingredients, good portion of salad, small portion of salmon. The place seem to be serving the same style as Chipotle - you pick salad bowl, pasta bowl or wrapped in a panini, then you add your choice of salad ingredients and meat/fish. That's it. Like I said before I would still come back as the place seems clean, friendly, tasty and fresh! Cute patio outside with free wifi! ;)
