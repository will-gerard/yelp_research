This is definitely one of my favorite spots in town!  I have lived here for just a little over 2 years, and I think I've been to the Gardens 5 or 6 times.  I'm from Tennessee and used to love going to their botanical gardens, but the DESERT Botanical Gardens are unlike anything I've ever seen!  I just love walking around there, and I feel like I discover something new every time I'm there.  I love the Chihuly exhibit that's there now.  I've seen it twice.  They also have some wonderful events there.  My favorite is Corks and Cactus, their wine tasting event, which I attended last weekend.  What could be better than wine tasting followed by wandering around amidst a bunch of cacti?  ;)  One of the best trips I had there was in April one year because so many of the cacti were in bloom.  Prior to that, I don't even think I knew that cacti did bloom!  It's just a great place to be.  If you're local and you haven't been, you need to take advantage of having this place nearby!  Get a list of their events!  I took my boyfriend for the first time, and, once he started walking around, he said that he couldn't believe he'd lived here for 2 years and had never been.  If you're visiting, this is definitely a unique way to explore Arizona--it's the Sonoran Desert compressed into an area that you can walk through in a couple of hours!  But if you're going in or close to the summer, be sure to wear a hat and cool clothes, as there's not much shade.  Also, I would recommend skipping their restaurant, Gertrude's.  It's too much to pay for not-very-special food.  Otherwise, enjoy!

I had a Groupon and went for dinner with my boyfriend last night.  This place is amazing!  We started off with the tapas sampler, and everything on it was great.  We also ordered bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, which just melted in my mouth.  For our entree, we shared a fried chicken dish--very good and actually not too heavy.  And if course, since it's a Cuban restaurant, I had mojitos.  They were delicious, and very authentic--no Bacardi!  In addition to the great food, the service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!

Top 5 dining experiences in the Phoenix area!  My bf and I went last night, and, from start to finish, it was perfect.  When we arrived, we were seated in a corner with a spectacular view.  We were immediately greeted by one of our three servers, and they were extremely attentive all night.  We shared the pork belly appetizer to start.  They split it without us having asked, and both of our plates were like works of art.  More importantly, the dish was stellar!  We are both hesitant when it comes to pork belly because of the potential to be too fatty, but this was fantastic.  For our entrees, he had lobster on top of some sort of raviolis, and I had hangar steak with risotto.  They were both excellent, but I preferred mine.  It was cooked perfectly and was a good portion size but not overwhelming.  The dessert menu looked great too, but we were stuffed!  So we moved outside and just enjoyed the view with our cocktails for a little while.  I can't wait to go back!

Awful service!  The drive thru line always takes forever.  Today, there was no line.  We pulled up to order, started to order, and then were told to hang on.  We had to repeat our order several times, and it took 5 MINUTES from start to finish to order our meal for 2!  Then, we were given our food, and, while we were checking out food, the guy closed the window and walked away.  We found that they'd forgotten one of our sides, and they gave us 2 ranch dipping sauces for 12 tenders!!  We sat there for a couple of minutes and then my bf went in to correct the problem.  He came out and said there were several people waiting for food.  The food was actually very hot and fresh, but service like that is just unforgivable.

Fantastic place!  I recently got rear-ended, and my boyfriend recommended Jim Winter to me.  Everyone there from the receptionist to the mechanics were incredibly friendly and helpful.  The estimate for my car was almost $700 to replace my bumper.  Prior to doing so, they called me and said that they'd cleaned it up and, if I didn't care about the small crack in it, I could just pay $100 for the clean-up.  My car is 11 years old, so I wasn't concerned with perfection.  So, I ended up making money off of being rear-ended!  I was so impressed because I feel that most places would have gone ahead with whatever work they'd make more money off of.  I will definitely continue giving them my business!

I just moved to Scottsdale and ate dinner here...AMAZING!  Service was great and food was even better.  But be warned, portions are huge!  I ordered an appetizer and the mini version of the mushroom fry, and it was more than enough food.  My mom had the Stetson chopped salad, which we both swooned over.  Oh, and we shared the sweet potato soup, and, had I not been in public, I would've licked the bowl clean.  I'll definitely be returning soon!

Ugh, I'm done with this place.  Tried it a few months back and was not impressed, but decided to give it one more try tonight.  I think the only thing I've liked was the tamale.  My boyfriend liked his enchilada style ground beef burro, but I tried it and didn't care for it.  I had the machaca burro supreme tonight.  The meat was somewhat spicy, but overall it was bland.  The rice has absolutely no flavor, and I love good Mexican rice.  Finally, the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp.  Plus, everything is overpriced.  I will just pick up Taco Bell next time.

I can't adequately express how disappointed I was in the management during the year that I lived here.  I moved in with my boyfriend, who'd been here for 2 years prior.  First of all, there was a leak in my ceiling that was first reported in November of 2013.  When was it fixed?  A YEAR LATER!!  During that year, not only did they not fix it, but they made a big hole in the ceiling that they left there for a few months.  We were away one weekend, and it stormed, and most of my bedding was ruined.  Did they care?  Nope.  Second, my ceiling fan broke.  I asked them to fix it, and they replaced it with a wobbly one that made so much noise I was never able to use it.  Third, there were several occasions that I would call the office asking for a package, and I'd be told I didn't have one.  Then, 2 days later I'd call again and would be told by someone else that it had been there for a few days.  Finally, and this isn't a management issue, but this place is just too full of douche bags.  The pool is like an MTV beach house.  Oh, and parking sucks.  There are not enough spots to accommodate the entire complex and guests, and the entire back of the complex is full of parking spaces that are too tight for most cars.  It's ridiculous!  Really the only good thing about this place is the location.  If you want to be in the middle of Old Town, this definitely puts you there, but be ready to put up with a lot of crap in exchange for the convenience.

I live in Old Town and had not been up to North Scottsdale in quite a while.  Over the weekend, though, my boyfriend and I stayed at the Westing Kierland with some friends and had to find a place for dinner on Saturday night.  One of our friends found Bobby's online, and, although I'd never heard of it, it sounded promising.  Well, it turned out to be much more than promising, it was exceptional!  First, the decor is very different and trendy without being pretentious.  Our server was very friendly and efficient, even being the only server for our party of seven.  But the main appeal was most certainly the food.  I started with the escargot appetizer.  It was incredibly flavorful with all of the garlic and butter.  There was not a drop of the olive oil mixture that did not get sopped up with bread after the escargot were gone.  For my entree', I had the cannelloni.  I love pasta, and this may have been the best cannelloni I've ever had.  They were very generous with the filling, the noodles had a good consistency, and the sauce was delicious.  You can choose between alfredo and marinara, and I chose both.  I would definitely recommend the "pink" sauce to anyone.  I loved this dish so much that I made everyone else at the table taste it!  Other dishes that I tasted were the fillet and the paella, both of which were delicious.  Paella is very hit-or-miss for me, and this was definitely a hit.  My boyfriend's fillet was cooked perfectly.  Our friends also had the lamb chops, which I did not try, but they said they were wonderful.  I don't think there was a single thing amongst the seven of us that was not enjoyed, and that is a hard task.   I would love to return soon!

My boyfriend and I stayed at The Boulders this past weekend, and it was amazing!  We like to take advantage of the summer deals around town--we live in Old Town Scottsdale-- and, of everywhere we've stayed, this is definitely at the top of the list.  If you've ever visited the Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, then you can kind of get an idea of how special this place is.  The Boulders is like a resort in the middle of the Desert Botanical Gardens.  It is very spread out, so much so that they have golfcarts that come around and take you to and from your room if you want.  It's August in AZ, so we took advantage of the carts the whole times.  The drivers were all extremely friendly and prompt.    Our room was the biggest selling point for me.  It was larger than most typical rooms, with a fireplace that I'm sure is wonderful in the winter.  The bathroom was big and had a separate vanity, which I enjoyed.  The bed was super comfortable!  The best part, though, was that we had a back porch with lounge chairs, where we sat and watched rabbits playing!  The rooms are not all squished together as they are at most places, and it was nice to have some privacy.    We had dinner at Palo Verde and were very impressed.  The food was delicious, and they even have their own brand of wine from The Boulders.  I had the cabernet and loved it.    My singular complaint about the Boulders was the pool.  We spent several hours by the pool on Saturday, and we could not go 10 seconds without swatting a fly off of us.  At one point, I looked around and counted 13 flies just in my immediate area.  It made it a little difficult to relax.  Also, the pool water itself seemed a little dirty, but not so much that we didn't spend an hour in it.  Despite the flies and the dirt, we did have wonderful service from Eduardo, one of the poolside servers.  Our cocktails were delicious, and he brought them to us promptly and checked in with us frequently.  Overall, I absolutely loved The Boulders.  It is definitely different from most of the other high end resorts in town, and it was wonderful to get a little more of that out-in-nature feeling.  We will be going back as soon as we can!  Tip:  if you're local, check the deals on this place during the summer months.  I think it's upward of $300/night regularly, but I think we got it for $115 in August.

My mother and I ate there last week, and everything was fantastic!  The homemade pasta dishes were incredible, and we also loved our bacon wrapped dates and the bread and pesto.  To top it off, our server was very friendly and made a lot of good recommendations.  Finally, the patio is nice and has a good view of the canal.  I can't wait to go back!

How have I never written a review until now?!  I refer to DJ's as "my bar," as do many others, I'm sure.  I am pretty much there every weekend because I live in Old Town and want to minimize my douche bag exposure as much as possible.  While most of Old Town is composed of clubs, DJ's is a dive bar where you can always feel comfortable and welcomed, but it's not gross like another Old Town dive that will remain nameless.  All of the bartenders are fantastic.  They are friendly and great at what they do.  Also, they pour big, cheap, strong drinks!  You can't beat that!  There's a reason that this bar has been around for over forty years, so check it out!

First and foremost, if you're trying to decide between this Hilton and the Hilton Squaw Peak that is 3 miles down the road, you absolutely should choose this one!!  My bf and I stayed 2 nights at the Squaw Peak Hilton and had the worst service ever.  We moved over to Tapatio Cliffs for one night and absolutely loved it.  The scenery is fantastic.  It is up in the hills and has fabulous views.  We were lucky enough to be in a room with a view, so that was even better!  The main pool was pretty, but not crazy busy, and the service was prompt.  There was also another smaller, more tucked away pool that looked nice, but we didn't get a chance to check it out.  We would have loved to have eaten at A Different Pointe of View, which is their nicer restaurant, but it was completely booked.  We will definitely make a trip back to eat there, though.  We did have dinner at Pointe in Tyme, their steakhouse.  The food and service were excellent, and we ended up closing down the bar.  We both really liked the décor and set-up of the space.  When we left, we both said that we would absolutely love to stay there again!

I would really love to be able to give more stars, but I just can't.  My boyfriend and I live in Scottsdale and went to this Hilton for a Valentine's staycation this past weekend.  He is a Hilton Honors member and has a lot of points, so we stay in Hiltons pretty regularly. This was definitely the most disappointing that I can remember.  The service was AWFUL!  The day we arrived, we went to the pool around 3 or 4 pm to just sit around and have some drinks.  I think our server came to us twice in an hour, and he forgot our drinks once.  This was even after the pool had started to clear out significantly.  Also, we ordered food, and he never took our dirty plates away.  The next morning, I called to order room service breakfast at 9:45.  I tried 3 or 4 times, and no one answered.  So, I called the front desk, and they put me in touch with room service.  Instead of apologizing and taking my order, the woman asked if she could call me back!  What?!?!  After 15 minutes of her not calling me back, I then called the concierge.  I apologized and told him I knew it wasn't his job, but could he please help me order room service.  When I finally talked to the woman in room service again, she told me she'd been trying to call and there was a do not disturb on the phone...BS.  I know that's not true because the concierge had to call our phone to put us in touch with her!  Then, once I'd ordered, I was told it would be 25 minutes...it was an hour.  So, the grand total of time spent between my first call to order breakfast and when it arrived was an hour and a half.  Not once did anyone offer to comp anything.  We did not go to the pool that day, so we didn't have to worry about service there.  Later in the day, though, my bf called for a wake up call and was on hold for 5-10 minutes.  He finally hung up.  That night, we actually had great service at the bar, and we were thrilled by that.  The next day, we went back to the pool.  Our first server was fantastic and attentive, but then, his shift ended, and we had the same guy from our first day.  Once again, he was awful.  I just don't understand how someone who works for tips could be so inattentive!    Aside from the service, this place is ok, but definitely not up to my local standards.  The grounds are nothing special, and we were stuck by a parking lot.  I think this would be a fun place for kids b/c they have a lot of kids' activities, but that's the only redeeming quality I see.  The two stars I'm giving are for our bartender Sarah, and our good poolside server Stephen.  I don't think we will be back.  We did, however, end up spending the next night at the Hilton Tapatio Cliffs, and it was worlds better in every sense!  It's only 3.5 miles away, so go there instead of Squaw Peak!

I have finally found my go- to pizza in Scottsdale!!  My bf and I have lived here for almost 3 years, and we've always complained about the lack of really good delivery pizza out here.  We've tried everything.  We'd even had HH's before and enjoyed it but weren't particularly blown away.  We are both huge fans of Detroit- style pizza--deep dish, 8 corner, crispy crust, lots of cheese.  Our favorite is Jet's pizza, but, unfortunately, Jet's has not made it out west...enter, HH's deep dish!  We'd had it once before, and there was too much sauce, so it kind of ruined it for us.  Thankfully, we decided to give it another try.  We ordered it with light sauce and the butter crust today, and it was fantastic!!  It's not Jet's, but it's the closest thing we've found out here!  When we want pizza in the future, that's what we'll be getting!  Oh, and delivery has always been fast, and our orders have always been accurate.  That is hard to come by around here.

I have been going to Salon d'Shayn since I moved to Scottsdale almost 2 years ago, and I have never had a bad experience there.  First of all, I love that I can schedule online.  It's so simple!  The owner, D'Lisa does my brow/lip waxes, but I've also been to Courtenay.  They both do a fantastic job while being very fast and friendly.  Marissa is my stylist, and she is great.  I have been doing the same thing to my hair (all over color) for the past several years, and she does it faster than anyone I've ever been to!  You'd think the quality would be compromised if the treatment is faster, but that does not appear to be the case!  I also love that I am always offered a glass of wine at my hair appointments.  If I don't want wine, there's water and lemonade.  Plus, they always have snacks on a table when you walk in.  I always leave with a purse full of fruit snacks and Laffy Taffy!  Finally, their prices are extremely reasonable.  When I moved to Scottsdale from Nashville, I expected everything to be more expensive, including taking care of my hair.  I actually pay less at Salon d'Shayn than I did in Nashville, and the quality is just as good if not better than what I was getting there!  I would definitely recommend them to anyone!

I live in Old Town, and The Lodge is one of my most frequented hang-outs.  The food is good, the happy hour is better, and I usually enjoy the atmosphere.  Obviously designed to resemble a hunting lodge, The Lodge is pretty cozy.  The lighting is somewhat dim but not dark, the booths are comfy, and there are a lot of tv's.  The back patio has cornhole and a decent number of tables, so, when it's pleasant outside, I enjoy sitting out there.  The happy hour is one of the best in town, in my opinion.  It is one of the only ones that is 7 days a week, and it lasts from 3-7.  Well drinks are $3 a piece, and certain beers are as well!  Definitely a bargain if you're a liquor drinker like I am.  Their food is pretty solid.  My favorite thing there are the fried cheese curds, which come with ranch.  I almost always order them when I'm there.  Their fried pickles, tater tots, and waffle fries are good too...can't you tell what a health nut I am?  ;)  I have not had the famed Sasquatch Burger, but I've had other burgers, and they're good.  The brat is decent but nothing to write home about.  One thing to avoid at all costs is the Buffalo Meatloaf special on Wednesdays.  Ugh.  My boyfriend ordered it recently, and I took one bite of it and wanted to spit it out.  The meatloaf was squishy, and it was topped with cheese sauce--like, nacho cheese sauce.  I have no idea who came up with that idea, but they should never be allowed to decide upon menu items again.    The only thing I don't like about The Lodge is that it can get pretty douchey late night on the weekends, but I guess that's true of most bars in Old Town.  Oh!  And they have a bathroom attendant on weekend nights.  Whaaaatt??  I can't stand feeling like I have to pay to use the bathroom, but I especially don't care for it at a place such as this, where I go to relax.  Also, the bathroom is really small and quiet, so if you're the only one in the bathroom, you're basically in there with the attendant just sitting outside of the stall listening and waiting for you to emerge.  It creeps me out, and I refuse to pay someone to hand me a paper towel.  No offense to the attendent, but I can do that myself for free, thank you.    Aside from my rant about the bathroom attendant, I generally enjoy going to the Lodge, and I will continue to as long as I live around the corner from it.  Just remember to get the cheese curds!

Overall, my party was very happy with Rita's.  We started off with the chips and guac, which were fantastic-- very crisp but not stale chips, and guac that wasn't too salty or spicy, although they can make it as salty or as spicy as you like.  My boyfriend ordered a caesar, and I honestly think it's the best caesar I've ever had because the dressing was really creamy!  I had the shrimp enchiladas and a side of their corn, which they were nice enough to take off of the cob for me.  I love Mexican corn, and this was some of the best!  The enchiladas were great too.  My boyfriend had the seabass, and it was well cooked and had a pretty good flavor, although maybe not as rich as I prefer seabass to be.  I can't remember what our friends had, but I know they were happy as well.  The service was just as good as the food.  I would definitely recommend it!

I went to Gallo Blanco last night with a group of 8, and, overall, I was very happy!  The food was fantastic.  I had the guacamole, smoked elote, a carne asada taco, a shrimp taco, and the tres leches cake.  I loved everything, but especially the elote and the tres leches.  The tres leches was topped with ice cream and strawberry sauce, and it was some of the best I've ever had!  I tasted a friend's shrimp and grits, and that was quite good as well.  I'm from the southeast, so I'm picky about shrimp and grits, and I was pleasantly surprised that it was as good as it was!  I also had a glass of sangria, which was alright, but it was pretty sweet, and there was more fruit in the glass than drink.  That was disappointing.  The service also was not fantastic.  I understand serving a larger group can be difficult, but there were 20 or more minute time spans where we never saw our server.  We were sitting in the lounge area, and the server basically told us that she kind of forgets about that area...not exactly what we wanted to hear.  She was nice and got our orders correct, but I would have preferred a little more attention, especially since we were a larger group.  My only other complaint was that it was rather warm in the area where we were seating, and there's nothing more uncomfortable to me than trying to eat while you're sweating.  Having said that, I really enjoyed the meal, and I will definitely go back.  With everything I ate, my check was under $25 for happy hour!

I love this place.  I've stayed here several times since moving to Arizona, and I have enjoyed it every time.  This past time was particularly memorable.  I got a Travelzoo deal for a night for $100, and so me and some girlfriends did a staycation.  I assumed that with that deal, we'd have one of the older rooms, but, instead, we had one of the newly remodeled rooms right in the middle of everything!  We spent the day at the Ocatillo pool.  I believe it's reserved for the Ocatillo wing guests, but we didn't realize that.  It was just the closest pool to us.  The bartender, Eric, was fantastic.  Even though he was the only one out there, he was extremely attentive and friendly.  You might assume that because we were a group of girls that he was flirty in order to get a good tip, but that was not the case.  He was just very nice and made sure that we enjoyed our time.  To top it off, when we returned to our room later that night, he had sent a bottle of champagne to our room with a note thanking us for coming to the pool.  If that's not good service, I don't know what is!  I will definitely be heading back there as soon as I can, and, thank you again to Eric.

If I were rating on food alone, I would rate David's 4 stars...but I'm not.  I have ordered delivery from David's 4 times, and EVERY SINGLE TIME they've gotten something wrong!  My boyfriend and I always order ranch with our French fries, and the second time we ordered, they left out the ranch.  So, the next time we ordered, I specifically mentioned the ranch and the fact that they'd forgotten it before, and I asked them to please remember it this time.  Was it in the bag??  No!  Another time, I ordered a breakfast burrito and specifically asked for sour cream and salsa and told them to be sure not to forget it...and they forgot it!!  I call and complain, and the person I talk to sounds like he's 20 years old and couldn't care less that I'm complaining.  I did get a credit once, but no other time has it been mentioned.    It's a shame that the delivery service sucks so bad because the food is actually very good.  Their burgers are great, and their milkshakes are to die for.  But, next time I order delivery, I'm going to tell them that, if they mess anything up, I am never ordering from them again.  Four times in a row screwing it up is just ridiculous.  This is delivery food, not rocket science.

I will be the first to admit that I am not that experienced when it comes to nail salons, but, from my limited experience, I think this place is great.  I recently started getting gel manicures to keep myself from biting my nails.  I'd had regular manicures in the past but had always been frustrated by how quickly they chipped and broke.  I had my first gel manicure at Biogio, and it was fantastic, and my others there have been great as well.  I had to go to another place--a "nicer" place-- once because I couldn't make it to Biagio, and I quickly learned that I don't want to go anywhere else in the future.  My manicure from the other place did not look flawless, as my others had, and it chipped within about a week.  Gel manicures are supposed to last for at least 2 weeks, and one of mine from Biogio lasted almost a month!    In addition to the great manicures, the establishment is comfortable.  It's not super fancy, but it's not a hole-in-the-wall either.  It's a good place for me to run to on my lunch break.  My only complaints about Biagio are that 1) the nail techs sometimes just sit there in silence, other than giving you instructions, and 2) the massage part.  I know most people would disagree, but I don't like the shoulder and arm massages.  It's not very relaxing to me, in fact, it kind of hurts.  But, the simple solution is that I need to request that the tech not do that part, but, for some reason, I feel bad about making that request.    Overall, I am extremely happy with Biagio's service, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

After trying other nail salons in town, I am updating my review to 5 stars.  I originally went to Biagio because it was close to my workplace.  A few months ago, I started a new job closer to home in Scottsdale, so I wanted to find somewhere more convenient than Biagio.  I tried one place, and I was not happy at all with the quality of my mani.  I tried another place--very nice, trendy, more expensive.  They took forever, and the quality still was not as good as what I get at Biagio.  Bottom line is that the nail techs at Biagio are fast, and they pay attention to detail.  I am always happy with the service I receive there.  From now on, I'll be more than willing to drive a little farther.

This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!  The escargot is to die for, as is their duck.  They also have the most delicious martini called a Le Poir--pear Grey Goose, St. Germain, and champagne.  And for dessert, their souffles are spectacular!  I had the Grand Marnier souffle at my last visit, and it was definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had.  In addition to the food, they have a very charming patio.

I don't do a lot of fast food reviews, but I see that Carl's has gotten s few recent poor reviews, so I wanted to throw in my compliments.  This is actually my go-to fast food place in Old Town.  My food has ALWAYS been fresh, and I don't think they've ever messed up my order.  Their burgers are great, and they have the best fast food chicken tenders around.  Onion rings are fantastic too.  Except for the hash browns, I think they beat McDonald's when it comes to breakfast.  They even have a breakfast burger, which is pretty ridiculous...and I mean that in the best way possible!  Finally, the employees have always been friendly.  Keep up the good work!

For what it is, this is a good place.  The staff were very friendly, the room was big, the bed was comfy, and the TV had the football channels that I wouldn't have been able to watch at home!  Also, it was cheap at only $60/night!  There is also a bar next door that is open until 2 am.  When we checked into the hotel, my boyfriend and I each got a free drink ticket, and we got 10% off food for being a hotel guest.  Not a bad deal!  My only real complaint was that the room smelled a little like mildew, but otherwise it seemed clean.  I travel often and have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels...this is not one of those, but they don't claim to be.  This is a place to lay your head after you spend a day on the lake, and I would lay my head here again.

My boyfriend surprised me on my birthday with dinner at Orange Sky.  What an awesome place!  We got there early to watch the sunset from the outside area.  It was breathtaking.  Because it was my birthday, they seated us in on of the private booths, even though he had not requested it.  That was definitely a nice touch, as we were able to watch the end of the sunset from the comfort of our private table.  Our food was delicious.  We had soup that was fantastic, although I don't remember what kind because this was a couple of months ago.  Then, for our entrees we shared the crab legs and some sort of steak.  The steak was good, but the crab was INCREDIBLE!  It was already shelled, so we didn't have to go to any trouble and were just able to enjoy it.  Then, they brought us a free dessert for my birthday, but I'm not really a dessert person, so I don't remember what it was.   ** One tiny little complaint-- a few months earlier my bf and I had been at the casino and just wanted to go up and look at the view.  They would not allow us to go up because my bf was wearing flip-flops.  I think that's kind of ridiculous in AZ, but, oh well, just be sure to dress to impress when you go there.

If you're looking for a place for good bad chinese-- you know what I mean, greasy and not at all good for you-- then this is a good place!  My boyfriend and I have lived in Old Town for 2 years and had yet to find a decent delivery chinese place.  I'd actually ordered from Yummy Yummy over a year ago and was not impressed.  But, either it's hit or miss, or their "new management" actually has improved things.  I tend to order a lot of fried, filled foods when I order chinese, and this place did it right!  I had crab rangoon, pork filled wontons, and an eggroll, and all were fantastic!  The eggroll was gigantic and very crisp, and the rangoon and wontons were crisp with a good amount of filling.  Usually when I order these things, the rangoon is soft and mushy, and the wontons are mostly breading.  So, I was excited that this was not the case.    My sesame chicken tasted like every other order of sesame chicken I've ever had.  I was not a fan of the fried rice that accompanied it.  It tasted kind of like I would expect feet to taste.  My boyfriend had chicken chow mein and orange chicken with the sauce on the side, and he was a fan of both.  Service was accurate and prompt, although, I asked for "lots" of sweet and sour sauce, and they gave me one small container of it, no more than they normally give.  In conclusion, will I go here when I want a gourmet dinner?  No.  But, will I crave this when I'm hungover and don't want to leave my apartment on a Sunday evening?  Absolutely!  I am happy to have an alternative to pizza when I want delivery food.

If you want to surround yourself with a bunch of douchebags wearing Ed Hardy-esque clothing, enough hair gel to set the place on fire, and too much cologne, then El Hefe is the place to be!  That, however, is not my taste.  I can't comment on the food because, after spending one Saturday night drinking there, I have never wanted to go back.  Plus, I can't imagine trying to eat while inhaling all of the aforementioned cologne.  I'll stick to DJ's, my "dive bar" down the street, thank you.

I have been working out in some way, shape, or form for 20 years.  For most of that time, I've just gone to a gym and worked out on my own.  I've always had a hard time with classes because I've never liked the pressure of having to go at someone else's pace, and classes have made me somewhat self-conscious.  Also, I've usually had access to a free gym, so I haven't been able to justify paying for anything.  Several months ago, I decided that my body was no longer responding in the way that I wanted it to from my usual workouts, and I knew I needed something different.  I do not care for jumping or lifting heavy things, and I'm very sensitive to the heat, particularly during the summer in Phoenix.  So, I was looking for something that would challenge me but not require me to be outside doing box jumps and whatnot.  I have a couple of friends who are Pure Barre instructors, and they encouraged me to try it, saying that it would change my body faster than anything else and that I would become "addicted."  Wow, were they right!  Actually, during my first class, I wanted to cry, scream, and vomit.  It was so incredibly challenging, I had to stop so many times, and I thought to myself "Can I really put myself through this on a regular basis?"  The answer was yes.  I'd bought a package, basically to force myself to keep trying, and, sure enough, after a few classes, I was hooked!  Has it gotten easier?  Yes.  Does it still kick my ass every single time?  YES!  Although, after a while, you get familiar with most of the techniques, every class is different.  The instructors always change things up, and new techniques are often introduced.  Speaking of the instructors, they are all amazing.  They learn everyone's names so that they can personally help you through the classes.  They really make you feel comfortable, which I've never experienced before in group exercise settings.    People always say that they "love" the classes...I am going to be honest and say that I am pretty miserable during that hour that I am at the studio.  But I mean that in the best way!  I sweat profusely, and everything hurts, and I still sometimes feel like I want to cry or vomit...but I feel so fantastic when I leave!  And at least I get to hear a lot of good music and be surrounded by other motivated people while I'm there.  I would recommend Pure Barre to anyone, and I'm so happy to have discovered it!

This is just an update, as I posted a long but glowing review of PB back in October.  I just want to add that, in the almost year that I've been going, PB has done more to boost my metabolism than any workout I've ever done.  There are other activities that will burn more calories in an hour, but PB keeps the burning going!  I try to go to PB 4 times a week, sometimes one more, sometimes one less...but I'm not an every day exerciser.  I eat a relatively healthy diet during the week, but, on the weekends, I pretty much eat whatever I want.  I am 33, and, for the first time in my life, I am not concerned about weight gain.  I just went on a week long beach vacation where I ate too much, drank too much, and did essentially zero exercise...but I came home feeling almost just as good as when I left!  This is a major accomplishment for me, and it is one of the reasons that I don't think I will ever stop going to PB.  If I were trying to lose weight, I know that I could by making a few changes, but, for now, it's so nice just to be able to maintain without any worries!  Also, even though it keeps my metabolism revved up, I somehow don't feel hungry every second of every day.  Usually when I'm getting a good workout, I feel like I can't get enough to eat, so this is a nice change too.  Thank you PB :)

I love Crudo's brunch!  If it were a little closer to home and a little cheaper, I would probably be there every Sunday.  I had the bacon risotto for the first time a few months ago and was hooked.  It is one of my favorite brunch dishes ever!  I've never had anything bad there, but the risotto is definitely my go-to.  Their dinner menu looks amazing, and I fully intend on trying it, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.  My only complaint is that it took a fairly long time to get drinks this most recent time.  Overall, though, I have always been very happy with my experience at Crudo!

I love Kelly's...in the light of day.  Almost every single Saturday and/or Sunday over the past few months has been spent with my friends on the patio here.  They have half priced bottles of wine, comfy couches, and friendly servers-- what's not to love?!  We are also big fans of the pork wings appetizer.  It sounds weird-- what exactly is a pork wing?-- but they're delicious.  Kelly's is always packed at night, but that's typically when we head out.  In my personal opinion, the dbag ratio increases the later it gets, but I guess that's what you expect anywhere in Old Town.  But if you're looking for a great patio to hang out on and do some day drinking, this is the spot!  Just leave a couch open for us ;)

When I first heard that there was a new restaurant from one of the Top Chef contestants, I was very excited.  I'm a huge fan of the show, and everything that they cook always looks amazing!  So, I bought a Living Social deal and was excited to use it.  Then, I both heard and read mixed reviews, and I became a little less excited.  But, I'm very happy to say that I went last night and it was FANTASTIC!  First I must talk about one dish that was quite possibly the best vegetable dish I've ever put in my mouth:  the mushrooms with burrata and toast small plate.  Words cannot express how much my friend and I enjoyed this dish.  It is a small skillet filled with mushrooms that are cooked in something heavenly, and then you pile the mushrooms, burrata, and arugula on top of this perfectly thick, soft, buttery toast.  My only complaint was that there wasn't more toast!  But even that wasn't so bad because I could have just eaten those mushrooms for days.  This was about as flavorful of a dish as I've ever had.  The other fantastic small dish that we had was the chicken and waffle.  I was hesitant at first because the batter was made with Frank's Red Hot Sauce in it, and I am not a fan of hot sauce.  Much to my joy, the dish tasted nothing like hot sauce but just had a fantastic depth of flavor.  I am from the south, and I am not sorry to admit that this was my first chicken and waffle!  I hope they're all like this!  Also, it did not say on the menu, but I believe the chicken was stuffed with maybe ham or proscuitto and some sort of cheese.  It was delicious.  Our last small plate was the scallop with bacon and caramel.  This was the one that we were most excited about, but it turned out to be somewhat disappointing.  After the other two, we were expecting to be amazed again, and we were not.  It was good, but, I will probably not order it again, whereas I will be returning as soon as I can for the other two dishes.    To top it all off, they give you these fantastic cheese biscuits when you arrive.  They are vey moist and flavorful and a great way to start the meal.  I only have two things to complain about, one of which was my fault.  I ordered the $12 La Primavera cocktail, and it was awful.  It is made with berry vodka, St. Germain, and Campari.  I love St. Germain and vodka, so I ordered this, not knowing what Campari is.  Well, it's a bitters, and, man, was this drink bitter!  I hate sending things back, but I had to send this back.  I can't imagine that anyone would like that, but, I guess if you're a fan of bitters, you might.  Our server was nice enough to take it off my tab, but that was about his only redeeming quality.  He wasn't a jerk or anything, but he wasn't particularly friendly either.  Also, we hardly ever saw him.  The restaurant was not anywhere near packed on a Wednesday night, but, for whatever reason, we saw everyone else who worked there a whole lot more often than our server.  The table next to him even had to ask another server to hunt him down at one point.  Having said that, though, it certainly wasn't bad enough that I wouldn't return.  Overall, both my friend and I were extremely pleased with our experience.  We left raving about the food and were just full enough but not disgustingly full after 3 small plates and cheese biscuits.  I will be going back soon, and I only hope that their other dishes are as good as these!

Morning Squeeze has my favorite breakfast burrito in town.  It is huge, loaded with good stuff, and delicious!  That is the only thing I've had there, so I can't comment on any of the other food, but when I've been with friends, they have always been happy with their food as well.  Unfortunately, I don't make it there very often because it's always so crowded on weekends--a testament to how good it is.  I have been a couple of weekday mornings, though, and my complaint was the same each time-- initially poor service.  Both times, I was seated and then waited at least 10 minutes for a server to come to the table.  I must point out that this was not during high-traffic times, so they couldn't even use being busy as an excuse.  The last time, my boyfriend actually went to the bar to get waters after we'd been sitting for so long, and it was only then that a server noticed and came to our table.  The good news is that, for the rest of the meal, she was pretty attentive.

My fiancé and I ate here last night, and we both remarked that we were kind of sad that we'd never been in before, considering the fact that we live within a few blocks.  First, I want to rave about the authenticity of this place.  I felt like I was in a cozy Italian restaurant in New York instead of in Scottsdale.  What this means is that it was a little crowded and loud, but I kind of loved that!    We started with Caesar salads, which were very fresh and delicious.  I could have used a little more dressing, but overall it was very tasty.  For our meals, we both ordered pasta.  I had the tartufo, and I was so appreciative of their letting me make a couple of changes.  I ordered it without the olives and added shrimp, and it was AMAZING!  I could definitely tell that the noodles were homemade, and the sauce was perfection.  It was a cream sauce but wasn't super heavy like most, and how can you go wrong with truffles, right?!  The shrimp were delicious, and I'm very picky about shrimp.  What was even better was the fact that the tails were off!  I really will never understand why so many restaurants choose to leave the tails on shrimp.  My fiancé ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli with meat sauce.  The ravioli were impressive--plump and flavorful.  He thought the sauce was a little salty, but I thought it was great, and I'm usually the one who complains about salt.  The desserts looked fantastic, but we did not save room...next time!  We will be back soon!

Wow, this place is good!  In the less than 2 years that I've lived in Old Town, this spot has housed 3 different restaurants.  Looks like they finally got it right!  You would think that in a town where everyone strives to be so aesthetically pleasing, that there would be more convenient healthy restaurants, but, alas, there are not.  Subway just doesn't do it for me, so I was so excited when I discovered this place.  I always get carry-out, so I can't speak too much to the service, but the cashiers have always been friendly, my orders have always been correct, and they have always been ready on time.  My favorite thing is the chicken protein bowl with the forbidden rice--delicious!  It has wonderful Thai flavors and is very filling.  I also love their raw vegetable salad.  Everything in it is very fresh, and there is a good ratio of lettuce to veggies.  I add chicken.  The dressings definitely taste too good to be healthy, so I usually use a little of their dressing and a little of mine at home that I know is lower fat/calories.  But sometimes I just don't worry about it because that raspberry vinaigrette is gooooooood!  I've also had a couple of the sandwiches and the sweet potato hash, both of which were quite tasty.  I will definitely keep going back!

EVO is a fantastic new addition to Old Town.  It has taken the place of T. Roosevelt's, which was more than a disappointment.  The first thing of note was the great service.  The owner spoke with our table for a while when we arrived and stopped by the table a couple more times during our dinner, and our server was very attentive.  We were there during happy hour, and they definitely have a good one.  Drinks were cheap, and they have a good selection of happy hour menu items, and happy hour is from 4-7 7 days a week!   I ordered off the regular menu and had the pasta bolognese, and it was fantastic!  I am never one to pass up homemade pasta, and this did not disappoint.  Plus, it was very reasonably priced for a decent sized portion.  I also tasted a friend's arancini (fried risotto balls) and my boyfriend's mushroom risotto, both of which were excellent.  The only reason that I am not giving 5 stars-- I wish I could give 4 and a half-- was the noise level.  I was with a group of 6, and we were sitting at a round table, but I had trouble hearing even the person sitting next to me once the place got busy.  That will definitely not keep me from going back though!  Overall, I had a great experience there and am happy to welcome EVO to my neighborhood.

If I were rating based simply on taste of the food, I would be rating a four, but, unfortunately, that's not the case.  Yes, the food is good, particularly the steak and cheese and the Capistrami.  However, the subs seem to be getting smaller every time I order.  I am a 5'2 girl.  I can't come close to eating a 9" sub anywhere else, but I did today.  The sub rolls may be 9" long, but they aren't even 3" wide!  I could probably even overlook that, though, if the service was better.  Every time I've been in the actual store, the people behind the counter always seem more interested in talking to each other rather than taking care of the customers.  I haven't been in there in a while, so maybe that's changed, but that was the case on more than one occasion.  My delivery service today, however, was atrocious.  It took over an hour and a half, and I live less than 1/2 mile from the store.  I called after almost an hour and was told that the delivery guy had left 20 minutes ago.  Then I called another 20 minutes later and spoke to the manager.  He would barely let me finish a sentence and kept just saying that there was only one driver and they had a lot of orders.  If I'd been told when I ordered that it would be a long wait, that would have been one thing.  But I was told it would take 40 minutes, and it took over twice that amount of time.  He offered me a free sandwich next time, but that really doesn't make up for such poor customer service.

I wish I could rate them on their actual cleaning services, but, since they didn't show up, that's unfortunately not possible.  I purchased a $75 Living Social Deal for 2 hours of cleaning from Clean Envision.  I booked them for this past Monday, as I was moving out of my apartment over the weekend and needed it cleaned afterward.  When I called to schedule the appointment, I didn't even know if I had the right number initially because the person answering just said "hello?"  I had to ask if I had the correct number.  I was told yes, and we scheduled my appointment.  I was told that I would receive a confirmation call prior to the appointment.   Well, that call never came.  I called quite a few times and left 2 or 3 messages on the day of the appointment...no reply.  So, that means that my apartment was left dirty for the complex to clean, which I will be charged for.  I called Living Social today to get a refund.  They put me on hold and apparently called Clean Envision while I was on the phone.  Living Social was able to get ahold of them, and they said that they had had a break-in and therefore had no access to their schedule.  They offered to work something out for a cleaning in the future.  Um, no thank you.  If they had actually called me to explain the situation, I might have felt differently, but they made no such effort.  Whether there was a break-in or not, their phone is obviously working now, and they have made absolutely no effort to contact me and apologize for the inconvenience and money that they cost me.  They definitely have my number because I left it in my voice messages.  I am actually looking for an agency to do some light cleaning on a monthly or bimonthly basis, but I am definitely not going to try to hire this company again.  I am just astounded by their lack of professionalism, and I called and left yet another message to that effect.

Ham and Gruyere crepe at brunch--GET IT!!  I was actually sad when I was too full to finish it.  I also had the burrata, which was delicious, but I would have liked a crostini or something for the sake of texture.  I ate dinner here a few months back, and, I honestly thought it was a little overpriced and overhyped.  The food was good, but I can't remember what I had, which tells me it wasn't stellar.  I like the atmosphere, and the service was great both times.  I probably won't return for dinner but will definitely be back for brunch!

Wow...I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to try this place the other night and sad that I hadn't made it over there before!  I love hotdogs, but rarely do I have one that lives up to the hype.  For instance, I had one a month or so ago that had been written up in a couple of magazines, and I was very disappointed because, although the meat was very good, the bun was too big, so really all I tasted was bread...definitely not the case with the Short Leash dogs!  I love, love, love the fact that they are served in naan instead of a bun.  Like the example I mentioned, buns too often dull the taste of the dog.  I ordered the Oliver, an all-beef dog topped with melted swiss, sauerkraut, and Thousand Island, and I added fried pickles!  Holy hot dogs, it was amazing!!  My friend and I had split the corn dogs bites to start with, and they were very delicious and sizeable--definitely more than "bites."  So, I figured there was no way I would eat my entire hotdog.  But it was so delicious that I just couldn't put it down!  My friend had the Mac Daddy, which she loved.  I took a bite of it, and the mac 'n' cheese and chili combination was fantastic.  The only thing I didn't like was my drink.  I had some sort of sangria, but not the raspberry one, and it just tasted very odd.  I will not order that again, but I will definitely be back to Short Leash as soon as I can for the food!  I want to try almost everything on the menu :)  One more thing, I saw someone else's review that said that the corndog bites were undercooked and "bizarre"...they must have had an off day at that visit because they were wonderful when I had them.  I've actually never had corndog bites outside of the southeast that I've been happy with, and these were perfect.  They were perfectly cooked and a perfect ratio of meat to batter!  They are quite large and filling, though, so, if you have a small appetite, you might want to skip them, split them, or have as entrée.

After reading all of the glowing reviews of Nook on Yelp, I decided I had to try it.  First of all, you might be caught offguard by the fact that it is in a strip mall, but don't let that bother you.  Once you're inside, you totally forget.  With a name like Nook, it is exactly what you would expect--a cozy little Nook of a place.  There's a bar, several booths along the wall, and a few tables in the back.  We sat in one of the booths and were very comfy.  My only complaint is that it is pretty hot in there, but that's due to the presence of the brick oven.  Although I hate being hot during a meal, I'm a little more understanding when I know the heat is coming from that oven.  However, I will say, that makes me wary about going there in the summer.  Moving on...  The service was very good.  They don't take reservations for parties fewer than 5, and my party was of 4.  My boyfriend and I got there early, though, to have a drink at the bar, and the hostess was nice enough to seat us without the rest of our party being there when the restaurant started to fill up.  We really appreciated that.  Now on to the food.  First, we all shared the shortrib bruschetta.  It was good but not as good as I was hoping for.  The pieces are very small, and, although the shortrib was flavorful, it just wasn't good enough to want it again.  Then our entrees came.  I had the Gamberetti y Funghi pizza.  It was good, but not what I was expecting.  The type of mushroom on it was one that I'd never had before, and it didn't really resemble a normal mushroom to me.  Also the shrimp on it was not my favorite.  Otherwise, the pizza was great--good brick-oven crust, great cheese.  One friend got the Quattro Stagioni pizza and loved it, but I didn't try that b/c I'm not a fan of olives or artichokes.  My boyfriend had the pasta crepe, and it was so different and amazing!  I may have to get it next time.  My friend had the chicken marsala and, although I'm not usually a huge fan, it was fantastic.    All in all, I loved this place!  Next time I will just wear short sleeves and order a different pizza.

Wow!!  This is my new favorite place in Old Town!  My boyfriend has been there a few times and took me yesterday.  First of all, they have a fantastic patio, which was a wonderful spot to spend a 70-degree, sunny Sunday.  I couldn't believe how packed the patio was at 3:30, but it was almost full.  There's also ample seating inside, which I will need in the throes of the Arizona summer.  Second, their drinks are relatively inexpensive and strong, and happy hour lasts all day on Sundays.  Third, the pasties are DELICIOUS!  My bf has tried a couple but has stuck with the Reuben because he thinks it's the best.  We ordered a Reuben and a cottage pie (like Shepherd's pie, but with beef and not lamb).  They were both amazing, but the Reuben was definitely my favorite.  The dough was cooked perfectly, the meat was in thick, tasty chunks, and the thousand island was very flavorful.  I usually order apps when I'm out to eat, but there's no way I could have at this place.  The pasties are big!  I barely ate half of each half that I had.  My only complaint is that there are too many different types to choose from!  How will I ever try them all?!  I will definitely be back soon and often, now that I have been introduced to this neighborhood gem :)

D-LICIOUS!  Bootleggers is in the location that was previously occupied by Praying Monk, a favorite of mine and my boyfriend's.  While we were disappointed to see Monk go, I have to say that I am overjoyed that their departure made way for Bootleggers' arrival.    My boyfriend, and a friend and I went for lunch a couple of days ago.  First of all, I like what they've done with the interior, and the service was very good.  The only change that I was not happy with was the fact that they took the big couch off of the back patio.  Oh well, too cold to sit outside right now anyway.    The following food items were ordered in my party:  chips and dip app, turkey melt, pulled pork plate, chopped brisket sandwich, green beans, cottage fries, and mac n cheese.  The only thing that wasn't amazing was the order of green beans.  They were ok, but nothing you couldn't get from the grocery store.  Their homemade chips are thin and crispy.  The dip is very good but very rich.  If you don't like goat cheese, you will not like the dip.  I had the chopped brisket sandwich, which comes with cole slaw on top.  I typically don't like slaw, so I ordered it on the side, but I loved it!  I put it on my sandwich and ate it alone, it was so tasty.  I also had a "side" of mac n cheese.  It was served in a skillet and was super hot with a layer of cheese baked on top--fantastic.  I could have just eaten that and have been full.  My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork.  It was pretty good, but that's just not my thing.  Finally, my friend ordered the turkey melt and cottage fries.  The fries were good, but the turkey melt was even better.  I usually think turkey sandwiches are a little uninspiring, but this one was definitely different.  The turkey was extremely flavorful, and combined with the melted cheese and arugula, it was a winner!    I will definitely be going back to Bootleggers sooner rather than later.  It was certainly one of the best meals I've had in Old Town in a while, and there are so many other things on the menu that I want to try!

Favorite spot in Old Town right now!  I think Hula's has been open for about a month, and I have been there at least 5 times that I can think of!  First of all, I love the décor.  It is very island hip casual, if that makes sense.  I love that there is one wall that completely opens up to the outside.  That has been particularly nice during this mild winter that we've been having.  Second, they have a great happy hour.  It goes until 7 every day.  My favorite are the mai tais.  Usually I am not a huge fan of mai tais, but these are special.  They are not the usual fruit-punch-red, sugary concoctions you get beachside.  No, they are not...but, I have a hard time describing them.  I'll just say they are delicious, and they definitely pack a punch.  Third, almost everything I've eaten there has been great.  The two things that stick out in my mind are the poke and the hapu with lemongrass sauce.  The poke was extremely fresh and flavorful.  Sometimes raw fish dishes are too salty for me, but this was perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the hapu and chose to get it with lemongrass sauce.  It was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had.  Even with a cream sauce, it was relatively light and just really different.  I ordered the butterfish and had it pan fried, and I should have known it would be too much.  It was tasty, but it was just too rich and definitely on the salty side.  I've also had the sweet potato fries, lobster bisque, potstickers, and the crispy coconut shrimp rolls.  I enjoyed all of those except the potstickers, which were too thick and fairly bland.  Finally, the service has generally been good.  The one night I went for dinner rather than happy hour, the service was excellent.  I will be going back to Hula's as soon as possible!

I'm always looking for healthy restaurant options, and Flower Child is a great one and is fortunately close to my home and office.  My one complaint is that I find it a bit overpriced.  Portions are good, but, compared with places like Chop Shop, I just don't understand why it's so expensive.  Having said that, the food is delicious.  My favorite is the Early Riser bowl, which I get with steak.  It's such a unique combination of ingredients, all of which are fresh and flavorful!  I could eat it every day!  I also love the Madras Curry and the Avocado Hummus.  Finally, service had always been on point.  I typically offer take out, and it's fast and friendly.  I'll be back soon!

Came here last night for Restaurant Week, and it was fantastic!  First of all, their RW menu offered so many more choices than other restaurants, so that was great.  I had the rock shrimp tempura, Mexican street corn, and pad Thai.  All were delicious!  I order street corn pretty much whenever I see it on a menu, and theirs was exceptional.  My friend also had a beef dish that was delicious. Another friend had the seabass, also amazing.  Service was great as well.  I can't wait to go back!

Just discovered this place recently, and, for anyone who prefers dive bars over the Old Town club scene, this is a cool spot to check out.  First of all, nothing on their food or drink menu costs over $5!!  They have a drink called the Alcoholic Salad, which is delicious, and, did I mention, $5?!  The only food I've tried is cheese curds.  They weren't my favorite, but oh well.  Next time I'll order loaded tots or a burger topped with a Mac and cheese patty--yes, that's on the menu.  They have shuffle board, fooseball, darts, skee ball, and a bunch of video games.  They don't always work, but it's fun when they do.  I think the only thing I don't care for is that basically all of the walls are chalkboards.  That would be cool if Old Town wasn't so full of immature douchebags who take up most of that space with inappropriately stupid stuff.  All in all, though, I've enjoyed hanging out there and will definitely return soon.

Yuuuuuuuuum!!  Last month, I ate at Vivo twice in a two week period because it is so delicious.  I am a sucker for homemade pasta.  Both times I ordered a pasta special called the Michaelangelo.  The sauce involved short rib, truffle something or other, and, I think, magic.  It was heavenly, as were the fresh spinach noodles that it topped.  My bf ordered the ravioli, and it was the best ravioli I have ever eaten.  I never order ravioli at restaurants because I love noodles so much, but, I might have to make an exception next time I eat there.  My friend ordered the carbonara, and it was great too--not overly heavy, which is quite an accomplishment in my book.  I also had the Vivo salad, and it was very light and fresh. The pizzas looked amazing, so I'm hoping to try one before too long.  Definitely check this place out!

I had a mostly great experience here yesterday.  I went in to upgrade my phone, which I hate doing because I always end up losing stuff in the transfer, usually pictures.  Luis was helping me the whole time.  He let me leave my phone at the store until the transfer was complete.  Also, he let me know about a great deal, and I got my iPhone 6S, case, screen protector, and a wireless speaker that I needed for a total of only $75!  Plus, we reduced my monthly plan by $20/month.   He was very friendly throughout.  My only complaint was that I left the store at 4:05 and was told it would take an hour and a half for the transfer.  I went back at 5:45 and was told that he'd gotten busy and didn't start the transfer until 5.  I was trying to make plans for the night so I was frustrated, but he was willing to let me use my old phone while I went home and waited for the transfer to be completed.  I am very happy with my new phone, and, for once, all of my pictures are still there!

GREAT new restaurant!  I ate there last night with a large group, and we were all extremely happy with everything we ate.  Highlights for me were (in order of the meal) 1) hummus and bread.  I am very picky about hummus, and this was delicious--very creamy and flavorful. 2) the lamb...oh my God, the lamb!!  I usually don't like lamb because the flavor is too gamey, but I was fortunate enough to get a bite of it last night, and it was one of the best meat dishes I've had in a while. 3) the bolognese--I'm a sucker for homemade pasta, and this was no exception.  Noodles were perfect, and there was plenty of the delicious sauce on top of it.  And the huge spoonful of, I think, ricotta on top made it even better.  The table kept passing it around. 4) the short rib--tender, flavorful, and I could've eaten an entire plate of the polenta that it came with.  My fiancé said it was the best polenta he'd ever eaten, and he all but licked the plate. 5) the pizza--we had one with spicy salami and another sweet one with fig.  They were both great!  Sometimes brick oven pizza disappoints me, but this was the perfect balance of crust and toppings.  Nothing overtook the rest of the components.  6) the creme brûlée--this is my go-to dessert, and I was not disappointed!    In addition to the food being wonderful, the service was stellar.  It was opening night, so they ran a little behind at times, but that is to be expected.  Our server was great about making sure we had full glasses and letting us know when our food was coming out, and, most importantly, she was friendly and knowledgable.  Finally, I loved the decor--very open, brick, wood, and awesome light fixtures.  It's upscale but casual--very welcoming!  We will definitely be back soon!

I am so happy to have The Saguaro across the street from my apartment complex!  The first thing of note is the spa.  Actually, the spa itself is nothing more than a waiting room with the individual treatment rooms in the back, but I had the BEST massage there!  I had a 90-minutes massage with Karen recently, and, no offense to my boyfriend, but it was the best 90 minutes of my life!  Unlike most places in town, the massages are very reasonably priced.  After my 90 minutes in heaven, I spent the day by the pool.  The Saguaro's pool is fun, vibrant, and they have good service.  I think it can turn into more of a party scene than I would like, but it's never been too overwhelming.    Their restaurant Distrito is great, but I wish they hadn't changed their menu earlier this year.  They actually took most of my favorite things off the menu.  I remember that my food was good the last time I went there, but not memorable as it had been before.  They do have fantastic guacamole, but the only criticism is that it's a tiny bowl of it.  They used to have a second restaurant, The Whiskey, and I LOVED that place!  It was comfy and never overly crowded, and they had my favorite burger in Scottsdale--maybe my favorite burger anywhere.  Sadly, though, they turned it into an event space earlier this year.    Another thing that I think is great about this place is that they offer memberships.  For a very reasonable price--under $200, I think!-- you can use the pool and fitness center any time you want, and you get discounts on food and spa treatments.  I can pretty much guarantee that there is nowhere else in Scottsdale that offers a deal like that!  I've already decided that, when I move out of my apartment complex and no longer have an on-site fitness center and pool, I will be getting one of those memberships.  Despite living across the street, I have actually stayed a night at The Saguaro.  The rooms are very unique and brightly colored.  My only complaints were that the bed was a little uncomfortable and squeaky, and the bathroom door was a sliding one that kind of made you feel like you were in a jail cell.  But overall, I love this place!

My friend and I ate here for breakfast this morning, and it was incredible!  I had the Croque Madam, and it was the best I've ever had...and I've been to France!  The bread was so cheesy and delicious, but not so toasty that it cuts your mouth like a lot of Croques I've had.  The egg was cooked perfectly, the ham was delicious and not too salty, and they didn't add anything ridiculous like mustard, as I've run into other places.  My friend had the steak sandwich, and it was great too.  The steak was cooked perfectly and not at all tough.  I also ordered a side of potatoes, which weren't anything to write home about, but my Croque more than made up for that!  I will be back!

I was excited to try this place, but, I'm sorry to say, I probably won't go back.  One test that I have of a place is their burger.  This burger is a double, so my friend and I decided to split it, thinking it would be gigantic.  But, when we got it, the patties were super thin, and it looked like a Big Mac, only not as good (and I don't like Big Macs).  In addition to being thin, it was pretty bland.  My friend got the ribs, and they were ok, but nothing to write home about.  In a bar-b-q restaurant, they need to be excellent.  Mac n cheese and fries were pretty good, but I can get those at a lot of other places that have better entrees to go with them.  Overall pretty disappointing.
