This place has been long time favorite. Service is always good and the food is great. They have a happy hour that features $3 appetizers. My favorites are the meatball trio in vodka sauce and the garlic cheese bread.

This has been a favorite place of mine for a long time. There are so many great options on the menu, so it'll take some time to try everything and very hard to pick a favorite.  The staff is nothing short of fun and make dining in a great experience.

The Thai Iced tea wasn't that good. Spring rolls and dumplings were tasty. After a long wait, the crispy chicken with cream sauce arrived, it was a disappointment.

If you come here, watch your bank account.  They gave out free upgrades and I went back to get an upgraded wash. I handed the attendant the card and he didn't seem to understand what he was supposed to do.  I tried to explain what I wanted a couple of times and finally gave up. His understanding of English was not good. I  asked for a receipt,  just in case, and he came back with a receipt for $6. When I checked my bank account, I had been charged  $10, so the receipt was fake. Of all the times I have been here when it was Hog Wash, I never had a problem.
