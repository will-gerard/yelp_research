Bottom line... AVOID this place! We got some good nachos, but we were starving so our judgment was impared. There was only 1 waitress for the entire place... at LUNCH TIME! She fought valiantly and did a great job, but she was outmatched by the many diners in attendance and the service was ultimately SLOW.   Burgers are $10 each without sides. Not worth it, but the nachos were plenty big to share with 2 peeps (also $10). Come to think of it... every item on their menu is $10 with a few at $11 and $12. They had Fat Tire on tap, which is great, but $6 for a pint is a Ripoff. Bloody Mary was $8. Again... ripoff.

This place looks like a taco shop from the outside, but it's a sit-down place with waitress service. When I walked in, I immediately realized I was the only white guy in the joint, which is always a good sign.  The chips were fantastalicious, with mexi-cheese and salsa already on them when they hit the table. Cool! I ordered two asada tacos (phenomenal "street food" type), along with sides of rice and beans. All this, along with a Diet Coke, set me back less than $9. Smokin' deal! The quality of ingredients and overall taste were wonderful. The service and atmosphere were great. I'd totally eat here again next time I'm in town.

Angel's Touch is nice. It's cozy and comfortable, but don't confuse it for upscale luxury. It's a cute little place with wonderful service and talented massage therapists. It's a great value and isn't too far from the strip. It's 10-15 minutes from the strip if you have a car. We didn't rent a car this time, so our cab rides cost $15-$20 each way and we saved at least $100 on the massage, so it's well worth it. All in all, I would definitely return.

Nice Hotel. Clean, modern, updated rooms with enclosed showers (separate from the bathtub). Friendly and prompt service from all the staff. Great Value with rooms for less than $100 much of the time.  Nice restaurants with anything from $10 sandwhiches/pizzas up to $200/person fine dining with an amazing view (Eiffel Tower Restaurant). Mon Ami Gabi is one of the best restauarants in Vegas, with a patio right on the strip. The piano bar is cool and there are tons of stores, especially when you venture down the hallway to Bally's. Planet Hollywood Mall is next door. We never found any reason to venture more than a mile away from our hotel during our entire stay! TIP: Spring for the extra $50/night for the "Rendevous Lounge." Daily breakfast bar and nightly dinner/hors d' ouvre bar with two "Build it yourself" cocktails included per day (mine were usually "triples" and no one ever counted how many we had). Good food and drink available here for a great deal.

My Friend Gabi certainly doesn't NEED another 5 star review, but she's gonna get one... NOW! We ate here twice during our stay at the Paris and both times were fantastic! Once for dinner and once for brunch. The roquefort steak and frites were amazing! The steak wasn't what I expected. It was really flat and about a foot long and 8 inches wide! But It was cooked and seasoned to perfection and I ate every last bite. I even ate every single meat-juice-soaked frite! Yah, I was stuffed to the point of being sick, but I ran 4 miles earlier in the day, so get off my case about it!! The eggs benedict dish was out of this world. Super rich and creamy, with the perfect amount of tang. I poured the entirety of one of those little tiny Tabasco bottles over the meal and it became the world's perfect hangover cure! The service was slow at times, but not enough to diminish our experience by even a half-star. Merci Beaucoups Gabi!!

TV's are plentiful, to say the least. They have approximately 2 gazillion of them. They crank up some sweet tunes during commercial breaks, which is a fantastic idea and really increases the enjoyment of the sporting events. The food is mediocre at best. The service is horrendous. Your waitress will sometimes disappear for 20-30 minutes.  The prices are high, given the low quality and bad service. I almost dropped them to ONE STAR, since they have a BYU flag. BYU sucks and their fans (by and large) don't drink... or tip.

This place was fantastic! And a great deal too! Service: 5 stars. The Hostesses,  the waiter, and even the waterboy were all over it.  The Food: 4+ stars! I had the "Tour D' America" which consisted of 3 hotdogs (Chicago, NY, and LA). Yah yah... I know... I got hotdogs at a burger joint. So sue me! These dogs were fantastic little units (think dog sliders). The weiners had a nice snap to them and the toppings were spot on. The Chicago dog wasn't really authentic (no poppy seeds, celery salt or neon relish), but was still delish. My wife's burger was great. Tender, juicy, and super flavorful. We got waffle fries (amazing!) and steak fries (not bad, but not so good). Ambience: 5 stars! Beautiful! Fun, just loud enough, clean and crisp. Sweet!

Great sandwich, excellent value. $5.99 for a really good sandwich on the strip? Yes, it's true! The sandwiches were smaller than I expected them to be, but were also much more flavorful than expected. We just had sandwiches. No sides, no chips, nothing else, and we were perfectly satisfied, but certainly not stuffed. Perfect! I had "The Italian" and my wife had the "Caprese" and both were very tasty. I would certainly eat here again.

1 star? 2 stars? Could go either way.  First off, it was Dirty. Secondly, there was NO service! We had to go up to the bar to order drinks. We had to bus our own table and borrow a towel to wipe it down prior to consuming anything.  The drinks were very good and the bartender on this day was very friendly and cool (this is why the 2 stars, instead of 1). They make a fantastic Bloody Mary! But yah... the place is outdated and the service is non-existent unless you sit at the bar.

I was debating between 4 and 5 stars. But when I couldn't think of a single reason for a deduction... duh! 5 Stars!! Fat Tire, Peroni, Newcastle Brown, Molson, Lev... all on TAP! What a beautiful and most wonderful thing to have over 100 beers on tap.  And the food, My God, the food Jerry!! I had the crabcake hoagie and loved it... we also had seared ahi salad, chicken enchilada stack, chicken fried chicken and an onion ring tower at our table and each was unique and excellent in its own way. The servers were friendly, fun and knew what they were doing. Sharp, crisp service and decor. The music was a tad loud, making it difficult to have a conversation, but with all the beers, let's be honest... our conversation would have been mostly gibberish and forgotten by the next morning anyway. LOVE IT HERE! This is a MUST when in Vegas.

Bad. Ass. Sandwiches! If you're looking for a downright phenomenal sammie, go here now! Capriotti's has been knocking it out of the park in Vegas for Decades.  I love this place!

For an airport resto, this place rocks! On my recent layover I had an excellent breakfast. The thick-cut bacon was wonderful, my eggs were cooked to perfection and the potatoes had great flavor and crunch. They have French press coffee, which is pretty cool given the location of this place. Add a touch of top-notch service and an ice-cold beer, and this was the breakfast of champions.
