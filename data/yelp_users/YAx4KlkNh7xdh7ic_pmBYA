Just got back from eating.  I used to love this place. But not tonight. Less than a minute after receiving my appetizers my food came right out. Got a kids Mac and cheese dish. My 12 year old took one bite and said it was discussing. You had to constantly stir from the bottom to bring up the cheese. I tasted it and found that some noodles were nice and soft while,  others were a little hard. The French fries were on the cold side. The server was very kind and pleasant. Also the tortilla wrap tasted as though it was store bought.

At Nexcare with my son. They just recently put up a board that shows your first name initial of last name and how long of wait before getting called back. How cool is that. I've always like this place. Always friendly quick service.

Went here for dinner last night.  I got steak house one. It was so delicious best steak dinner I ever had. I ate it all and usually when I eat steak out I save half for later. Well I didn't with this one. It was that good. If you go there you have to try it. You'll love it like I did.

Excellent food and service. Love there sesame chicken. I can eat it cold and it's still crunchy and tasty.

I had a very good experience there today. Three three employees help us with our purchase today. The male employee Marcus really went above and beyond. Marcus went out of his way to find a toy gun my son want it and searched and searched and finally found. This is the second time in two weeks that I had a very good experience.

I just had the best experience ever. Tiffany and Andrea are wonderful. Actually all employees were. The very minute that I approached Tiffany she was helpful. Her ideas and everyone else's helped made my experience feel so good. This place was more helpful than Walmart and Hobby Lobby  other place I have been too in the past. I would recommend this place to anyone who projects that they need to accomplish.

Took my son there several hours ago. He got stung by a wasp on the side of his left foot. He was in a lot of pain. He was able to get the stinger out. Because when he took his sock off he saw it. Then a friend gave him a penny to rub the rest out. I didn't see a stinger in his foot, put some ice on it and gave him some pain medicine before taking him in. They didn't see the stinger either. But treated him made him feel really comfortable. We left happy and he was very happy with all the staff that helped. They did an excellent job. I am always pleased whenever I go to any of their facilities.

2 tacos not happy with it because there are very small tacos. And it cost 2 dollars each. The kids like the tacos but it is not worth the money. Before I even pay for it I asked the cashier are they regular size tacos she told me yes then when I questioned her when I got them she says those are our normal tacos

Great shop to go to. I love the experience from the minute I walk through the door until I leave. This store has a great selection of comics, statues, and toys. I enjoyed every minute of my experience while I was there. You must go check it out for yourself. My son loves the store he wants to go every week.

This is the best sub shop. My 11 year old son loves it. He will not try any other sub shop again. You must try it for yourself I promise you won't be disappointed. Their prices are fair.   On 3/25/15 all proceeds will go to Phoenix Children's Hospital a good cause.

I had to get my locks re-done because I lost one. The gentleman who came over was very professional. On one of my doors I did not have a key to it eat it. But he took the extra time to do it and worked with me on the cost because I only had so much money to work with. I would definitely recommend them to anyone with lock issues. They know what they are doing!

Nice place but don't like the fact that when you buy a fun pass at the kiosk .  You don't get $5.00 free like you would at the counter. Also on the kids meal doesn't include a drink unless you get the pizza one. Kid combo is $5.95 drink is $2?95. If I'm going to spend that much I'll go to Wing Stop where I van get it all. As far as arcade goes you're better off going to Peter piper or chuck e cheese. My son only really likes gravity and laser tag. This place is OK but not the best. Bye the way the most expensive game here is $4.65 the least is $0.65 a $5.00 card don't get you much. Good thing my son don't like arcade games. His friend that does got to play only 3 games on the card. They need to adjust the kiosk to add on the additional free $5.00 like they do at the counter.
