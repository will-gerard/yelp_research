First time to Armadillo Grill and I was pleasantly surprised. Based on other people's reviews, I was expecting a dingy, dark dive bar. This is just not the case! I think many people simply have never been to a real dive before. The area surrounding the bar was dimly lit, but that's a good thing! It looked pretty awesome in there actually, and the pool tables were in a separate area in the back. We sat in the other separate area with booths which was brighter and gave it a quieter, more restaurant feel (even the bar area was NOT that loud).  I have to agree with everyone's love of the fried pickles. Went with the original kind. I think they dip them in panko after the batter, super crunchy and delicious. I forced my roommate to try one bite with ranch dressing (he HATES pickles), but he actually couldn't seem to stop taking more bites. Pretty funny! I ordered the salmon in parchment special for $9.99. While it was good, it was not great. It tasted like the salmon I buy (and cook myself) from Costco. A little chewy on the teeth, but hey, it's 9.99! It came with green beans, broccoli and carrots which were really well prepared with garlic. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed cooked veggies so much. There was wild rice pilaf as well. Tasted like the kind I used to buy in small boxes at the store. That's not a complaint, it's good. My roommate ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which he liked very much.  I think we were supposed to get the pickles at half price since we ordered at 6:45, but were charged full price. It didn't matter this time since we were using a Groupon and were a little short using the whole thing anyway, just something to note. Service was a little slow at times, but not enough to make us upset, we weren't in a hurry. Besides, everyone there was VERY friendly, even the servers that we only saw in passing smiled and said hello. That's pretty rare, especially in Phoenix (I'm a native, I can say it)!  Overall, I would definitely come back. I like the atmosphere, people, food and prices. Just wish it was closer to my house!

We ordered takeout from Flamingo Palace last night and it wasn't very good. The Broccoli Beef smelled funny to me so I didn't try it. The Sesame Chicken was ok, but didn't stand out. Neither did the General Tso Chicken. Both fried chicken dishes were extremely soggy, but I guess that's expected for most takeout. White rice was a tad bit hard. Egg rolls were good though. It makes me a little sad to say that Panda Express has the best Chinese food in the immediate area. I wish Shangri-La would open a location on this side of town.

I asked if corrosion protection grease came with a battery purchase. The female store manager with curly hair and glasses laughed and kind of rudely said "uh, no". I saw this manager quickly grab the free grease attached to the new battery terminal (after an employee fetched it for her) and throw it in the counter, probably because I was already purchasing a packet for $1.50. She thought I didn't see, but I did. How dishonest! I'm not going to waste time returning it, but that $1.50 sale got her store another 1 star review.

My roommate and his family are from Chicago and are huge fans of Spinato's, that's how I was introduced. We used to always get the Hawaiian pizza until we discovered the spaghetti calzone. If you're a fan of carbs and the idea of a pasta-filled calzone sounds appealing, you'll love it! You have to ask for ricotta to be added (in addition to the standard mozzarella) and can add meatballs if you wish. It comes with extra sauce on the side. Very simple, but so delicious! I also like their cannoli, but they reduced the size to about half what they were and didn't reduce the price. I would order them all the time if they were big enough to warrant the higher than normal cost.

I have been a member of Desert Schools for over a decade now. At first it was great. The service was awesome, always plenty of tellers ready to serve members, even the NSF fees were about half that of a regular bank ($16 vs. $30+.... because sometimes things happen). Now, it's becoming a pain to bank here. If  you must go in and conduct business, there's usually no more than two tellers available (it's starting to remind me of the post office). Also, their fraud prevention is EXTREMELY tight, and it makes it seem like they are more about inconveniencing members than actually preventing fraud. I discovered this on a trip to Michigan a few years ago. I went to check in at my hotel and my card came back declined. I had plenty of money in my account so I knew it had to be a bank problem. So when I got through after a rather lengthy wait on hold, the representative would not help me unless I could tell her the amounts of my last two deposits and the exact dates they were made. Now this is what I'm talking about... who would know that? Seriously? I could give a ballpark number and dates, but to be that exact when I didn't have my statement or computer to check? I offered to give her some other form of identifying information, including my SS# or my last two addresses, but no, it had to be the deposit information. So I had to hang up with her in order to use my phone on the hotel's wifi and check (and that was real fun getting the hotel manager to give me the password before I had checked in). Then I called back and was finally able to be helped. Turns out that at Desert Schools, if you are going to travel outside of your home city, you basically must get their permission to use your own debit card. You need to tell them WHERE you're going and the exact dates you'll be gone. I'm all for preventing fraud, but this just feels wrong to me, and I really did NOT appreciate standing at the hotel reservation desk for an HOUR dealing with this BS. Oh, and the kicker is that Desert Schools does NOT offer 24 hour assistance, so if you're needing to call and get their permission to use your own debit card, you had better make sure it's within their business hours, otherwise you're sh*t out of luck! As was the case tonight. I wanted to order some deeply discounted PC games from a company based in Europe, so my card was automatically declined, but there was no way for me to call this ridiculous bank and get them to allow the debit to go through. The sale ended at midnight and I have no other Visa, so Desert Schools caused me to miss out. I am NOT happy about this at all and I think it's time to switch banks. Considering there is no benefit to staying with DSFCU compared to a bank like Chase or Wells Fargo (they have 24 hour customer service lines), I am just going to make the move. Even their NSF fees have climbed to match the others ($35).

My roommate and I have managed to stay away from this location for about a year or so, actually driving out of our way to another location if we want to eat Subway. Unfortunately, my roommate gave in to convenience and brought home subs from this one. Even before anything was unwrapped, I just knew it was going to be awful, and I was right.  I'm sorry, but these people have either never been trained on how to make subs, or they've been instructed by the owners to be as skimpy as possible with the toppings. The lettuce was lightly sprinkled on, as if you might add a dash of oregano. At first I thought it had been forgotten! Couldn't detect any crunch whatsoever. I had to open it to find out if there was any on there. There were maybe eight pieces of black olives on the entire footlong sandwich! Even the tomatoes were skimped on by a couple pieces (compared to EVERY OTHER SUBWAY I'VE EVER BEEN TO). So really, our sandwiches were  practically just lumps of wadded up meat and cheese, slathered with a little mayo on bread. This is NOT good to me at all, and not what I want or expect from Subway. We shouldn't have to pay for this garbage!   So why am I SO incredibly angry right now? James is an a**-h*le and was incredibly rude to my roommate on the phone when he politely called to complain and get the situation rectified. He downright refused to allow him to speak to a manager (or have the manager call him later) and only offered to replace half of my pathetically-made footlong. What about my son's 6"? The half of my footlong that I did eat? (I was going to bring the other half so they can see how badly it was made.) We were hungry. Are we really expected to stop eating (while very hungry), jump in the car and hurry over there during rush-hour? No, that's not good customer service. We weren't looking for anything extra either, even though it's a pain to drive back to a restaurant because of something they did wrong. We just wanted what we paid for.   Why are all the other Subways we've been to consistently good and this one consistently sucks? Not the first bad experience with James either (all-around bad attitude) but certainly the last time we spend a dime at this franchise.  We will be talking to corporate about this.

I stopped eating KFC after getting mild food poisoning from it the last 2 times, and there aren't a whole lot of options for fried chicken in North Phoenix, so I decided to make the 20 minute drive to this Church's, which has been at this location for at least 30 years (I believe). When the girl told me it would be about a 10 minute wait for chicken, I did not mind at all. They make fresh small batches, so waiting is good in this case. The chicken was nice and crunchy (I wish they seasoned it closer to KFC, but oh well). Mac and Cheese was very good, and their honey-butter biscuits are amazing. There were three people working and seemed to be mostly professional and efficient. One girl however, didn't acknowledge a customer that had just walked in. He stood there for several minutes and she ignored him until he said something to her. I don't care if you're busy, it is the easiest thing in the world to say, "Hi, I'll be with you in a moment. " Seriously, use your head!

See's has been my favorite boxed candy since I was little. It's so good and the recipes haven't changed (unlike Fannie May...  which is now yuck). My top 4 favorites are Dark Bordeaux, Lemon Truffle, Raspberry Cream and Butterscotch Square.

In n Out has never disappointed me (after I found out about "fries well done" that is...). For those who just don't understand the hype, it's very simple. Fresh, high quality ingredients. Doesn't taste frozen because it isn't (even the buns, cheese and veggies taste much better than other cheap eating options). The service is outstanding, probably because they pay more than other fast food joints. Now, I will say that the food is very good taken home or back to the office, but to truly experience it's greatness, it should be eaten immediately at the restaurant or in your car in the parking lot (so the toasted bun and everything else is crisp vs. soggy). It really makes a huge difference!

I think this place could do well if they made some changes. First of all... the iced tea was not good. I think I recall a previous reviewer comparing the taste to Band-Aids. I've never tasted one, but the tea tasted as they smell... oddly plastic-y. My roommate ordered the chicken parm, and although he didn't say it was bad... he seemed remorseful from not ordering the Lobster Ravioli. In my opinion, it looked like it had way too much mozzerella, couldn't even see any breaded parts of the chicken. I ordered the cannelloni, a favorite of mine. I was dismayed when I saw it covered in meat sauce (which tasted canned). Now, in my many experiences in ordering this dish, it's always been paired with a cream sauce! The menu didn't specify. The good thing I suppose, was the gnocci served with it (which was good) had cream sauce and I would steal some of that and incorporate it into bites of my cannelloni. Creme brulee was not horrible, but the carmelized sugar could have been darker and more berries would've been nice for the price. So overall... it was ok, not great, but ok. The server was Chazz and was very personable and friendly.

I have never been to this place, but have been a HUGE fan of their flour tortillas for years. They are so good, I eat them straight up! People that don't think they're great must enjoy the taste and rubbery texture of preservatives, that's what all the other brands have.

This is my favorite place for chicken teriyaki. Kind of reminds me of Tokyo Express, but the sauce is sweeter. I get my bowl with white meat (excellent quality), white rice (although their brown is good too), no veggies. Sometimes they can be a little heavy on the sauce, so I ask for half of it in little plastic cup. The eggrolls aren't the best because they're grilled (comes out soggy), but the flavor is good.

I am dropping my rating from five stars to two since the last three times I ate here, the white rice was severely overcooked. This last time, half of the bowl was complete mush and very hard to finish. I probably would have said something had I dined in, but since I took the food home, I didn't really feel like calling in a complaint. I think this franchise is already in trouble due to it never being busy, so repeated fails like this are inexcusable. I will probably start going to Yogi's Grill from now on (unless the owner of Sam's wants to contact me and assure me the food quality is back on par).

I hate to rate a Samurai Sam's so low since I love the location at 7th Ave and Bell Rd, but this one is totally different. My biggest gripes are the rice (white) and portion size.   The rice reminded me of plain ol' (dry) white rice, like Uncle Ben's. Other Samurai Sam's locations use a sticky rice that is perfect for teriyaki. Did they run out and hit up Costco in a pinch? Who knows.   My large chicken bowl was not packed very full. The amount of chicken breast (also dry, by the way) was fine, but the lack of rice made me wonder if I could've had a similar portion in a regular sized bowl for less money. The side salads we got also did not come with any dressing (to-go order).   I do feel bad leaving a negative review since the owner seems to be very well liked, but I would encourage him to visit the other location and see how the food quality differs. Both are of equal distance away from me, so I'll continue to eat at the other one, which I adore.

I haven't been here for awhile since I've moved across town, but this still stands as my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. My favorite items are the Orange Chicken, Lemon Chicken and *the best* Hot and Sour Soup. Large portions, excellent quality. It was always very affordable, the lunch specials in particular.

My boyfriend and I visited on Saturday 4/12 to play some video keno on the older Game King machines that seem to be phasing out everywhere else. THAT was awesome, but the thing that made us leave after just 30 minutes of play was the length of time it took to even spot a cocktail waitress and the quality of the drinks. My Long Island iced tea was mostly Coke with a little sweet and sour, I really didn't detect any alcohol. Not worth the $1 tip and I didn't drink it. My boyfriend's margarita was far worse. It was all mix (tequila? where?) and the mix was truly disgusting. It had a weird musty bread taste to it. Definitely undrinkable. If you just order beer, you're probably safe. Me? I'll just keep going to the Palazzo/Venetian where the gaming is good AND you get high quality free drinks.

I was not impressed with this place at all. Coffee wasn't great, but drinkable (similar to hotel lobby coffee). My pancake was not very fluffy, too dense. I ordered it with fresh strawberries which were cooked into it, but I would have preferred them raw on top. My boyfriend's skillet (the one with sausage and ham) was ok and was probably the best thing I tried there. His mother's bacon and cheese omelette was not very good and she ate less than half. The bacon they use for omlettes is the same stuff Taco Bell does... shredded little bits that tastes like some kind of pork, just not bacon. Her friend's bacon strips were extremely overcooked, dark brown and crunchy vs. crispy. The homefries were terrible. Just potatoes with A LOT of some kind of cajun seasoning all over. I thought homefries were supposed to be seasoned with salt, pepper, onions and green peppers... The one good thing about this place was the wait time. 10 minutes for a party of four on a Sunday morning.

If I had the ability to choose my last meal on Earth, it would be what I had last night at Outback. Yeah, it's a chain and I ALWAYS order the same thing every time. I really REALLY love it! Always consistently amazing and never disappointing!  So for last night at THIS location:  Bread with butter- Awesome! What is it, molasses bread or something? Whatever it is, the semi-crusty bread with fresh whipped butter was good enough for me to eat an entire mini loaf myself (and I usually never fill up on bread).  Caesar salad- The first time I had an Outback Caesar, I didn't really care for it. It does not taste like your average Caesar dressing, it's got a peppery kick to it. It grew on me however, now it's my favorite! So good and well dressed with plenty of croutons!  Herb-crusted prime rib (picture posted)- OMG, this is even more amazing than the "regular" prime rib I used to get here (which they don't have anymore). I always get it medium-rare without steak sear (I would think searing it would defeat the purpose of eating a nice, pink cut of prime rib). Oh, also ask for the creamy horseradish on the side. I wish I knew the recipe for it because it's delicious and not overly spicy. I usually do not have a large appetite, but  I must admit to finishing an entire 16oz cut, just couldn't stop eating (fyi, over the 8oz cut, you can get 16 for just $5 more... much better deal).  Green beans- Even the green beans here were picture perfect and  cooked just right. They reminded me of the ones I had at Morton's (which is pretty pricey in comparison).  Sangria- I had the blackberry and strawberry-peach. They were both good, but go with the latter, it was by far the best.  Waitstaff- Our waitress was pretty good. Very professional and friendly, but not overly so (some people may like or dislike that). No complaints here! I also liked how another waiter and even the manager pitched in to clear some of our dishes when she was busy. That's teamwork! Oh, the manager also stopped by to ask how our food was, shows he genuinely cares!  :)  *My 2-cents on a recent reviewer that blamed Outback for giving him and a friend a bad cold/flu. These viruses take time to incubate, up to 2 weeks in some cases. The likelihood of becoming this ill after less than 24 hours of exposure is pretty low in my experience (I'm a mom and have been sick many times in my life). I've also been sick at the same time as friends who live across town that I haven't seen for awhile, same symptoms and everything. We live in a big city with a lot of nasty non-handwashers. Just thought a possible coincidence with no real basis for blame was unfair for a 1-star review.  :/

I have been procrastinating for a month on reviewing Satori Sushi because I really hate saying negative things, but my one and only visit (with my boyfriend) was absolutely terrible. Thank goodness we had a Groupon, because if we had not, I would have felt robbed.  I should first mention that we tried to eat at Satori a few weeks prior to this visit on a Saturday around 6:00 pm. They were closed even though the hours posted on the door indicated they should be open. Another reviewer had a similar experience, so they must sporadically close sometimes. A note of explanation on the door would be considerate.  So, when we did finally get the chance to eat here...  We were greeted and seated by the owner who appeared to be very friendly on the surface, but in the way that seems like a facade. There was only one other couple there at the time (early evening on a Saturday). I ordered a beer and my boyfriend just had water. As another reviewer pointed out, the tap water tasted pretty bad, as if it came from the handwashing sink. I'd recommend the owner invest in a water filter.  One of the rolls we ordered was Vegas roll. Now, one of the problems I have with sushi rolls, is that I am allergic to avocado. Since avocado is in most of them (and in the Vegas one) I always ask to have asparagus substituted after explaining my allergy. I have NEVER had a problem at other sushi restaurants with this simple request being done at NO CHARGE, since it's not me being a picky eater, but I am actually ALLERGIC to an ingredient. After the waitress asked the owner about my request, I was told they would do it, but for an extra $2 (the roll was already $12.50)! How insulting. It's not MY fault I can't enjoy avocado like everyone else. I told her that was ridiculous (isn't avocado generally a more expensive ingredient than asparagus anyway???) and asked if there was anything they could substitute for free. I got cucumber, which I am actually sensitive to but not completely allergic. Whatever, I went ahead with it. The second roll we got was the Chicago roll ($15). I also got 2 pieces of salmon nigiri for $6. For these prices, the portions should be huge. That's why we only got two rolls. I've been to other sushi restaurants with similar pricing and was stuffed after eating only one.  So far I was not at all impressed with this place (the phone ringing on a wall right behind my boyfriend's head didn't help). I had a sinking feeling that the sushi was going to be a great disappointment, and I was right.  The nigiri was small, not nearly enough rice used. The Vegas roll didn't have enough batter and was not very big. The Chicago roll was even more disappointing in size and the "kobe beef" was very chewy and tough. The presentation of everything was also very boring and uninspired. That's being a little nit-picky, but they need to try and justify their prices in some way! Just because they are in North Scottsdale doesn't automatically give reason to charge $12-20 for subpar sushi rolls!  So the straw that broke the camels back is what happened after receiving the check. I mentioned my Groupon to the waitress and she left to talk to the owner. He came over with his fake smile and said we had to order something else. Our Groupon was for $40, and our total before tip was just under $41. He tried saying that he couldn't run my boyfriend's card for under a dollar and we needed to order something else, suggesting dessert or another beer. I told him the total was going to be much more than that since we'd be adding a tip. He proceeded to argue  and said I didn't understand how Groupons work and that we still needed to order something else. He gave us a "specials" menu and pointed out two-for-one sushi rolls... including the Vegas! Why were we not told of these specials initially?! They didn't know we had a Groupon until the check was brought out! This was all really making me mad and I did start to raise my voice a little. I told him that besides being a very experienced Groupon-er, I was also a Yelper, and he really needs to stop hurting his business by upsetting customers with unsavory business practices. I pointed out the lack of people in his restaurant on a Saturday evening (6pm at that point) and also suggested he greatly increase portion size and quality if he wants to continue charging that much. I told him we were NOT going to order anything else, and if he wanted me to call Groupon right then and there, I would. That did the trick. He said, "Ok, ok.", and processed our payment, and not a moment too soon. We wanted OUT of that place! As we left, he and the chef shouted something at us in Japanese. Was it a friendly farewell, thanking us for our business or something else? We will never know since we'll never come back.  *Please note, one of my pictures says "$8 salmon nigiri". This is a mistake and I am unable to edit or remove that picture.

I have been to Butterfields several times over the years, and while I always thought it was good, I just never seemed 100% impressed. I'm not sure, but I think they've expanded the menu, meaning there were plenty of things that sounded awesome for me to decide on. So yesterday I had the Strawberries & Cream Belgian Waffle. I gotta say... it was damn good. Exceeded my expectations in fact. One thing I hate about ordering breakfast with whipped cream, is it's usually the light aerosol can stuff that melts into a pool of liquid about a minute after set in front of you. Not the case here! As you can see, they use heavy whipped cream, and lots of it. The strawberries were very fresh and ripe. It was really perfect. Price was not terrible either.

I love the way this location cooks their Orange Chicken. It's tangy and spicy, and cut into smaller pieces so it stays crispier (not all Pandas cook it the same). I did come in once an hour before closing and was told the white rice was gone. That was a bummer, but oh well. The OC was really good and made up for it.

I love Coffee Bean for the unique, malted taste of the powders. I do not love this location though.   About 3 months ago, I received a free drink for buying a $25 gift-card. I ordered the new toffee-flavored drink, and said I wanted it OVER-ice (I've learned to use that term with this chain) and with non-fat milk. The girl said something about how it's already pretty low-fat. That should've been my clue that there was a disconnect in communication, because what I was handed was one of those disgusting Ice-Blended drinks. Sweeter than a milkshake, that's why I don't like them. That's why I STRESS "OVER-ICE" at Coffee Bean. I really wanted to tell her it was wrong, but the girl was really nice, I was in a hurry and not to mention, the drink was technically free. I drank MAYBE 1/6 of it and dumped the rest when I got home. It was an extra-large, too.   :/  So the reason I decided to post this review, is because of my boyfriend's experience this morning. He ordered an iced black & white mocha. What he got was a HOT mocha. He is shy and dislikes confrontations of any kind, so he just accepted this completely wrong drink and left. He said the girl that took his order had no personality, and when she called his drink to the barista, she said vanilla latte, which he did correct at that point.  I used to be a barista, and there really is no excuse for bad service like this. I could MAYBE understand a mistake happening once in awhile if you're working the bar and have 20+ cups lined up during the morning rush (not exaggerating), but for someone working the register to screw up and have lackluster personality to boot... not cool.  I'm not sure I'll go back to this location again or not. Sometimes I feel it's just not worth the hassle after a couple bad experiences.

I have had a love-hate relationship with this place (specifically this location) for a long time. I love this locations horchata. It's different than other ones. I've gone there JUST for that. After last night's meal though, if I ever do go back and am disappointed, it will be my own fault for going.  I have spent about $100 over the past couple months here on three separate meals. You'd probably think that I got a lot of food and drink for this money, but no, I really didn't. For example... last night I ordered five rolled tacos (beef taquitos with cheese on top), a Texas burrito, two large horchata drinks and two churros (which were not sweet at all and had NO cinnamon or sugar on them). For this, I paid $24 and change. Pretty sad if you ask me. I could have (and should have) gone to a nice sit-down Mexican restaurant. It would have cost about the same and I would have been much happier with the food. Seriously, where does Filiberto's get off charging $1 per "rolled taco"? These things are tiny and worth $0.50 at most. You can see how cheap they are too in their coupons. For example, if you check-in on Yelp, you can get $0.50 off! Ooooh!!! Wow!!! How generous of them!!!  The food quality here is questionable, they charge way too much for it, probably pay their employees minimum wage (customer service here is TERRIBLE) and all the while, the owners must be making BANK. I will not support these people anymore, and I recommend that you don't either. I'll figure out how to make horchata myself.

I too have been a loyal fan of Flo's for more than a decade, eating here every week for awhile when I worked in the area. Sadly, I can't say I'll ever eat here again. It's true, prices have gone up and the quality and consistency has gone way down.  The boyfriend and I visited twice in the past couple weeks. The first time, the only thing we really liked was the white rice and General Tso's (spelling?) Chicken. It was sweet, savory & spicy. The other menu items were a fail. Spring rolls were tiny (like as long as my pinky finger!) and I believe $4 for just TWO. The brown rice was mushy and overcooked. The Orange Beef was bland. Their orange sauce is definitely not as good as I remember, which used to be my favorite.  The second visit, last night in fact, we ordered General Tso's Chicken and Mongolian Beef. Unfortunately, the brown rice was again overcooked. C'mon guys... if I can make good brown rice myself with a crappy $30 rice cooker, what is your excuse?! The General sauce lacked the spiciness of the previous visit and was just OK. The Mongolian sauce was good, but the beef was mushy. It seems like they might soak it in meat tenderizer for a LONG TIME. Very weird consistency.  Seriously pains me to say that I won't be back. Very sad.  :(

I've had dinner here a few times and have never had a bad meal. The fish and chips are very good, but a little pricey for just two pieces of fish ($24) and some fries. The tartar sauce is great, must be house-made (I usually do not like tartar sauce). My boyfriend had the Irish nachos with steak... quite possibly the best value there. I think it was $17, and the portion was more than he could finish for dinner. I don't know what's in that sour cream and beer cheese sauce, but it is wonderful! The live Irish band was LOUD! but played very well. Good times!

My boyfriend and I wanted to find a local sports bar to watch a morning Patriots game. I checked Yelp and found this place. There was a Yelp deal going on so figured we'd try it out despite some very negative reviews. So my boyfriend has his jersey on, he's all excited to watch the game, and when we get there, the place is PACKED despite it being 10am. Literally only two seats available at the bar. So we take them. Despite the many TVs, there was only one showing the Pats game which was all the way across the room and not viewable from our seats. We decided not to order anything without first making sure we could watch the game since that was WHY we were there. We spent a few minutes trying to figure out if there was a TV nobody was watching. There ended up being two practically next to each other that had the same game on. Perfect! So we asked the female bartender if she could have the Pats game put on. Her answer was simply, "I'm not sure." and she turned around and went elsewhere. No offer to find out for us or any other assistance. My boyfriend and I just looked at each other like, "Okaaay... what do we do now?" and we started debating whether to leave or not (we did buy the Yelp deal after all and the game had started). A couple minutes later the bartender came back and asked what we wanted to drink. We explained that we weren't going to stay if we couldn't watch the Pats game. I asked her once again, if there was any way we could get a TV tuned in to it. She pointed at a rather intimidating looking man with grey hair which I assumed to be the owner by the way he was walking all around the dining areas. "You can go ask him." Great... I was actually dreading this because I read in a previous review that the owner was not very  accommodating with customers (and my boyfriend was too shy to go ask). So I moseyed on up to him and *gulp* asked. He gave me a sour look and thought for a moment, but didn't say no. He held up his finger and said, "We'll see." as he went into a back room. Good sign... I think? So we're sitting there with our fingers crossed, and finally the game comes on! It was bizarre how grateful we felt being "allowed" to watch a game at a sports bar! The food wasn't bad by any means, but nothing to write home about. I recall the draft beer selection not being all that awesome, so I stuck with my good ol' stand-by... Guinness. I will say that the male bartender that day WAS very friendly and welcomed us as newcomers (even though it was after we asked for the check). He just may have saved the experience and we might give this place another go.

I have stayed at The Palazzo countless times and have always enjoyed myself. The rooms are decorated nicely and they have great room service food. The drinks in the casino have always been top notch, they don't skimp on the alcohol just because it's "free". I ONLY like to play video keno and ONLY on Game King Multigame machines. I've noticed they are becoming harder to find, not just at Palazzo, but anywhere. Some casinos don't have ANY and have replaced them with exclusive keno machines. Still, I can usually find what I'm looking for at Palazzo, even if I can't always sit next to my boyfriend. PLEASE don't take away any more of them, Palazzo! The people that tend to sit for hours on end play Game Kings!

First time trying Indulge BaM and my roommate and I really enjoyed it. Colton was our server and was awesome! Very friendly and super attentive, not annoyingly so.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich with blue cheese, baby greens and tomato on the brioche. Very high quality ingredients and they did not skimp on any of them! The chicken was awesome, right amount of char, the taste reminded me of chicken you'd get at a good old fashioned cowboy cookout (that's a good thing if you've never been to one). We split an order of sweet potato fries that came with buttery marshmallow dipping sauce. Really unique and tasty! It's a little bit pricey for casual food, but it IS high quality food so you really shouldn't feel ripped off. I had a Yelp Deal, so the whole meal, 2 sandwiches, order of fries and 2 drinks were $25 spent including a $7 tip. Now that's a deal! Will return for sure!  One last side note... the restaurant was very clean, nice  simple yet modern decor, and the owner was there and seems like a genuinely nice guy, very smiley. :)

I am giving a 5 star rating not because I think Subway is a 5 star restaurant, but because of the service. At most Subways around Phoenix, the service leaves much to be desired (and occassionally straight pisses you off). Every time I've been to this location, the employees have been incredibly friendly and make your sandwich with care. Whoever owns this franchise obviously pays attention during interviews.

This place (Sun Pain Management) is pretty bad. The office is ghetto and dirty, and the front office staff are the WORST. Long waits, rude, vindictive staff (you better kiss Tina's butt or she'll go out of her way to make things difficult for you). Unless you are a NEW patient, you have a 10% chance of getting through to someone on the phone, and when you do finally, a 50% chance of being put on hold and hung up on. They WILL NOT EVER return a message, even though a voicemail system is set up. I can't believe I put up with this place for almost a whole year. I was accused of having morphine in my urine test once, which was 100% not true. It had to be a switch, operator error or bad test. They made sure to have a bodyguard present in the room with the NP when telling me about this, and the NP was extremely stern and cut down my meds as a punishment that time. So each visit thereafter, I was always worried of it happening again (of no fault of my own). The urine testing company is co-owned by Dr. Burns, so I question the competency of the staff there after seeing the poor quality of employees he hires for his pain clinics. The reason I finally left for good was because I went in for my scheduled appointment and noticed a sign stating that a new referral would be needed if you change your PCP. Stupid, honest me mentions that I did recently change doctors. The response I got was that I could not be be seen. No if, ands or buts. They claimed they wouldn't get paid by insurance. This is NOT true, as I not only called to ask my insurance about that, but they had been getting paid for almost a year since this was the SECOND doctor change I had since starting there! Just one more way to make life hell for their patients. You cannot simply stop taking pain medication, and it's not easy to get them prescribed on a last minute type situation! Simply horrible. I have tried to call and arrange to be discharged as a patient there, but I can't get through and have been hung up on the one time I did! They can shove their pain contract you-know-where I suppose. I am DONE.

This is one of the worst McD's I've been to (unfortunately closest to my house) and it seems like the reason why is management. In the 5 years I've been going here, I've had many incorrect orders, been overcharged several times, had inconsistent or poorly made food/coffee, been treated rudely when trying to get problems corrected. I've had to wait FOREVER because of understaffing (or maybe they're just that bad). A couple times they asked me to pull ahead at the drive-thru and wait for them to bring my food out to me. Both times it was clear that I had been forgotten, I didn't order much at all and watched for 10+ minutes while people behind me drove off with their food and drink. I actually had to call and remind them I was still waiting! The icing on the cake is I just found out they raised the price of the McWrap from $3.99 to $4.99, the only McD's in the area that has done this. So you know what? I'm done with this location. If I absolutely had to have McD's again, it'll be somewhere else. Whoever owns this franchise needs to get a clue.  One last tip to this location... Try putting an adequate amount of sauce/mayo on stuff so people don't have to order it with extra, which sometimes backfires when you actually get "extra" (better than not enough IMO, but still way too much). Seriously, you want me to come back behind the counter and teach everyone what a "normal" amount of sauce looks like? It's not hard people...

This review is based on breakfast only, but I'll update it after I try more meals.  As my 15 year old son would say, "This buffet is BEAST!". I ate here on a Monday at 9:30 and it wasn't terribly busy. Breakfast is around $12 (incl. tax) and you get beverages as well. The food quality is really high and being a buffet, it eliminates the "Do I choose savory or sweet?" dilemma I always face at most breakfast joints. You can have it all as long as you have stomach space!  The fresh fruit all looked really good and the pineapple and grapefruit I had was great. The blueberry pancake wasn't the best, but the waffle with butter and strawberry sauce was killer. I must eat more of that next time! I am not a huge fan of sausage links, but these were quite good, and the bacon was cooked PERFECTLY. So were the hashbrowns and potatoes. I did not care for the peach smoothie at all, but that was the only thing I didn't like.  The wait staff was friendly and efficient. We will definitely come back!

I'm a huge Smashburger fan, my frequented stores located at Norterra and Desert Ridge. This location SUCKS.  I went for lunch with someone who has never had Smashburger before. I wish I had been paying attention when he ordered because he ended up getting a pretty plain burger, no fixins. He said he assumed they came with lettuce, tomato, etc. and that the girl at the register did not ask what he wanted on it.  Second problem, the ice was being filled in the beverage dispenser and some genius employee unplugged the machine first and decided to not tell anyone, not even the girl filling the ice! Several customers asked staff what was up with the drinks, but nobody investigated the problem until I made sure someone understood, "The beverage machine does not seem to be ON." Took a lot of head-scratching before Mr. Genius came out and said, "Oh! I unplugged it! Haha...". This whole fiasco led to about 20 customers needing drinks all at the same time.  THIRD and possibly the most inexcusable problem. My fries... were SWIMMING in oil. I was able to eat most of them, but there were quite a few that were inedible. I will post a picture. It was really gross. You can clearly see the oil slick on the fries, what's harder to see is the POOL underneath them, but it was definitely there. What kind of half-assed, lazy fry-cook allows this to happen? I really wanted to complain about this, but given that it was A. very busy and B. low-caliber employees I'd have to deal with, I figured it was just not worth the hassle.   Avoid this location, especially if introducing someone new to Smashburger.

Saw Baroness last night at Club Red. They were awesome and sounded great at this venue, but there were a couple things I did not like.  First of all, after emptying my pockets, the security guy was suspicious of my e-cigarette mod (which was fine). What wasn't fine is how he got all jumpy when I tried to open it for him. He was unfamiliar and messing with it, which was not cool. He could've broken it! The wooden panel that comes off is held in place by four small but powerful magnets. If opened improperly, it can yank the battery out and drain it. That would really suck for me. Anyway... security needs to calm down a bit with people who are obviously trying to cooperate with the search process.  My second problem is a much bigger one. I cannot prove it, but I am convinced that the liquor at Club Red is watered down. I had 3 strong beers before arriving at the show and decided a Long Island would be the perfect finisher to give me the buzz I was looking for. When the bartender free-poured it, I was mightily impressed. I would say the "liquor" filled 3/4 of the cup before the splash of sour and Coke was added. Walked away, took a sip... hmmm that's odd, with so much liquor in there, why can't I really detect any? I should've been able to feel SOME kind of effect from the drink, right? No, not at all, which was why I ordered a LI in the first place. It's supposed to be a strong drink when not watered down, even if a jigger is used!  So yeah, my advice is to bring a cheap e-cig if you vape and if you have a DD, catch a buzz elsewhere before coming to the show (or get a beer, that's probably safe).

I love Chipotle. I've been to quite a few of the locations around town and all have been fairly consistent, aside from one that is AWFUL (cough cough... by Metrocenter... cough cough) and now this one which was AMAZING!  Maybe it was a fluke, I don't know, but if every Chipotle's food tasted as good as this did, I believe the chain would become even more successful.  The flavors seemed more amped up than usual. Take the lime-cilantro rice for example. This is the FIRST time I have ever really tasted the lime! It wasn't overpowering, but gave the burrito a wonderfully tangy kick. That alone was probably the main reason it tasted so much better to me (and my roommate). The chicken also seemed like it might've had a tad bit more seasoning. I don't know but it was really awesome!  I sincerely hope that this is not a one-time occurrence. It was really delicious and has reawakened my craving of Chipotle! Good thing this location is fairly close to home!

There is such a thing as "bad Chipotle", and when it happens to you, it's really quite awful. My rating for this location WAS a 5, but that was awhile ago and employees and times have changed. This 1-star rating is based on my last two visits, but I will elaborate on my visit yesterday.   The Bad: 1. Incredibly long line due to incredibly slow service. Chipotle is usually a rockstar at squashing long lines! What is going on here and why are there employees standing around chatting when there are customers to help and filthy tables to clean? Seriously, at one point there was only ONE guy on the assembly line and NO-ONE at the register. They were NOT short on help. 2. Poor ingredients. Black beans were actually black water with several beans floating around (my boyfriend's burrito was very soggy as a result). Mild tomato salsa was mostly liquid (I have NEVER seen this before at a Chipotle). I had to ask the guy to scoop my salsa at the end where some dry tomatoes were hanging out. I don't want salsa liquid on my salad. Which brings me to another problem... where was my salad lettuce??? I wish I had been paying attention when he put it in the bowl, because when I started eating it, there was barely any. I can't have rice or beans, so I really need an appropriate amount of lettuce to bulk this thing up. I also opted to pay for double chicken, and I wish I hadn't,  as the chicken was quite fatty and gristly. 3. This is a personal pet-peeve of mine, but as we were eating outside, we saw a couple employees getting into a car that was parked front-and-center by the entrance. This shows a great lack of caring for the customers. Even when I was 20 and working at Starbucks, I knew not to take those few coveted spots in front. How rude!  The Good: 1. Um... well really, nothing. How awkward.  Overall, this location has gone to hell and is in dire need of a change in management. It no longer meets the standards that I have come to expect from Chipotle.

This location is great, best sub I've had yet. My roommate told me before how friendly the staff was. Not sure if it was the same guy, but very courteous and friendly. It's rare nowadays (in PHX at least) for restaurant employees to care enough to ask you how your day's been and make small talk with people. That always gets a tip out of me! Food is excellent and their roast beef is pink instead of nasty brown. I love that! I would love it even more if they would call it 'roast beast' (Grinch anyone?). Also, their bread is of the crusty variety, not soft like Subway. Sometimes I wonder if other reviewers think it's stale as they're basically comparing apples to oranges there. I didn't really pay attention to the prices because I had a coupon, but they send coupons in the mail all the time, so people should keep a lookout for those. Even though you can get a bigger sub elsewhere for cheaper, these subs are heartier and therefore way more filling. I can eat a footlong sub at Subway with little effort, a regular sub from Jersey Mike's, not as easy! That's a good thing!

This place definitely has potential, but there aren't enough pros at the moment (and way too many cons) to get me to return.  Pros: Brulee Buns... OMG... these are amazingly good!!! Definitely worth the extra $1 to get it! Burnt sugar on the insides of the bun... genius!!!  Beef... I honestly couldn't tell if the charcoal flavor was from the beef or the Brulee Bun, but either way, the "burger" tasted good.  Service... the guys that work here seem passionate about the restaurant and were all very patient (I'd never been here before) and friendly.  Cons: Price vs. Quantity and Quality... First of all, the burgers are not very big for the price. Also, the portion of fries was quite expensive for such a small serving (but that was ok because I didn't want to finish them). I talk about quality below.  Fries... I ordered seasoned fries and was expecting seasoned breading. What I got were extremely mediocre plain fries sprinkled with a little BBQ seasoning. I didn't like them (it was hard to finish my small serving), and the mayo or ketchup I had at the table didn't help. Which brings me to...  Ketchup... seriously, whatever generic brand of ketchup this is, it's really gross. Thin, watery, with a very off flavor. Even store brand would be 100% better. It reminded me of eating fries in Elementary School.  Lettuce (iceberg) and tomato... the produce quality wasn't great. It wasn't the worst I've ever had, but it was definitely lacking. Again, I expected better for the price of this small burger.  Neutral: French Toast Fries... these were ok. The portion size was actually on point with the price, but there was just something a little off about them. Old oil? I'm really not sure. Maybe we were just a little put off by the "cons" that it was just our imagination.  All in all, I really wanted to like this place, but didn't. I'm not sure if things were exactly like this when Guy Fieri visited, but if they were, then I'm not sure why he is considered a food expert. To the owners of this restaurant... you can do better and I think you know it. While we were there, you guys seemed pretty busy. Maybe you have some regulars that come in all the time and you're comfortable with the way things are, but you can't ride the hype from DDD forever if there's mediocrity going on. I might check Yelp in 6 months to a year, see if you've changed. If not, there are plenty of other truly gourmet burger shops around.

Today was my second visit to PCA and I felt compelled to write a review on my thoughts so far. I'll update this review as I progress.  First of all, I do believe that acupuncture works. When I was 18, I started having pain in my neck from my desk job. It was becoming a chronic problem, and I was in pain every day for 3 months straight. After two treatments with a local practitioner, the pain was completely gone. It was truly magical!   So fast forward 16 years... I have many health problems, including fibromyalgia and chronic pain in my back, neck and shoulders from a car accident 14 years ago. These are the main reasons I am coming to PCA.  I have only seen Mayo so far, but I can tell you that she is a very strong empath and healer and has such a beautiful and caring spirit. There is definitely a powerfully healing vibe in the treatment room, and I don't mind at all sharing the space with other people. In fact, the more people there, the more intense the vibe (IMO).   After my two treatments, I felt lighter and not so weighed down, which is awesome because that is probably the most debilitating problem I have at the moment... body fatigue. My mid-back pain seems slightly better too. Since my problems are chronic and have been around for many years, I do have realistic expectations that it'll take multiple treatments for my body to heal and the results be long-lasting, so I plan on coming to PCA regularly for awhile. Maybe I'll see you there!

First time at Thirsty Lion. When we arrived, the hostess told us it would be about a 25 minute wait (for 2). It was more like 35-40 when our table was finally ready, but whatever. Next time I'll make a reservation.  The food I ordered was awesome! Chicken Penne Gorgonzola (or something like that). The sauce was flavorful and had a kick thanks to the red pepper flakes, plus some spinach and halved cherry tomatoes. Best part, they didn't skimp on the cheese! :D I wasn't crazy about how the chicken was cut into thick chunks (on the bias would be more appetizing for such a beautiful dish), but that's just me being picky I suppose.  Will definitely come back.

I really love this place. I'm not sure why there are so many mixed reviews... maybe what they ordered? I always get the regular size custom burger... blue cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato (and sometimes bacon). Simple and delicious. The rosemary fries with Smash sauce are also amazing. The only thing I didn't care for were the fried pickles... a bit too salty.

I really like this place, but ONLY for sushi. It's extremely good, and for $15 all-u-can-eat for lunch, you CANNOT beat it. I wish the cooked foods were on par, but they really aren't. Oh well, it works out since my boyfriend doesn't like sushi much but does like their Chinese food.

First time at this carwash and I was pretty pleased. I got the $15 wash and my black car came out pretty nice after I dried it further with the provided disposable towel. The only downside was that my 2 front tires weren't shiny at all really (but the rear ones looked nice)... maybe the reservoir on the machine was low. The teenage/early 20's kiosk attendant with braces was very friendly (keep it up my friend, you will go far in life with such a great attitude). The older guy helping me line up on the track was also very friendly. 2 for 2, at a carwash, OMG!!! The only reason I might not come back very regularly is that there is a carwash in Scottsdale that offers unlimited washes for 30 days for $15-25 (depending on the wash) and it's right by my boyfriend's place. If this carwash could offer something like that, I'd be sold.

I have only been here once, but will surely be back! I'd be a regular if I lived or worked in the area. I can't remember what my burger was called, but it was the one with blue cheese. When someone orders a blue cheese burger, it's because they LOVE blue cheese and lots of it. This one did not disappoint in any way, shape or form! I wanted to cry over not being able to finish it from lack of stomach space (I tried really hard though). The sweet potato tots were really good with the pineapple sauce. I also had a VERY generous "Mike Tai" (their spin on the Mai Tai). I love it when a place gives you a drink you can feel! The service was outstanding and it seemed the owners were there working too (I can usually tell). They clearly have a lot of pride in their restaurant.  Now that the review of MY awesome experience is over with, I will say that my boyfriend's burger wasn't as good. He was a huge fan of this place already, so it's no big deal, BUT... the waitress that talks up the PB&J burger really should stop (I'm not the only Yelper who thinks so). Some things are an aquired taste. I love Braunschweiger but that doesn't mean I'd recommend it to everyone. The PB&J burger SOUNDED intriguing, but it just did not work for him. He really didn't like it at all and neither did I (of course I tried it!). It was also incredibly messy.

I've had Pellini several times now and it's become something I crave. I always order the same thing, and it's really good as a cold wrap. Grilled chicken, pasta, tomato, romaine, parmesan cheese and LOTS of their gorgonzola dressing (it's so good)! For people who say that they wrap their ingredients in a "regular tortilla", I disagree. I haven't confirmed this, but I suspect that the tortillas they use are the local Red Eagle brand (no yucky taste of lard, butter or preservatives). Very light and flour-y. I have loved them for many years, and they are so good I like to eat them plain. Whatever Pellini uses, they prepare them with a little olive oil and sea salt. Super tasty!

I wanted to like this place, I really did. Spent $24 on three regular size turkey subs with bacon (extra $1.50 each sandwich for the bacon). No drinks or anything, just the subs! They might be longer than a 6" elsewhere, but they are practically half the width! I really couldn't taste any turkey (not much on there), just bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo. The restaurant was clean enough, but smelled bad. Not sure why... Won't be back, sorry!

I am amazed this place has so many good reviews! Seriously, look at the Yelp pictures people. These "sushi chefs" do NOT know how to slice the fish very well! I think I could do a better job! The other problem I had was the temperature of the fish, not cold at all, and I'm talking about a bunch of nigiri I ordered to be specially made (wasn't sitting out on the conveyor). Look, I know not to expect super high quality sushi at a place like this, but Sushi Station does way better. Teharu needs to step it up some. I felt quite rumbly in the tummy for the next 24hrs. On a side note, it took FOREVER for our waiter to come by and bring us the check despite it not being super busy.

I really love the pizza here. All the components are just right. The crust is very tasty, bubbly and slightly chewy. The sauce isn't too sweet or zesty and they put a perfect amount on. The cheese isn't skimped on either. I usually don't care for pizza sausage, but their kind is sliced and very good. I love that I can have Gorgonzola cheese on my pie! It's my favorite!

I stopped in here exactly once and it's the last time. I do not understand why Jimmy John's only offers provolone cheese. I do not like provolone cheese that much. So lame... get some swiss up in here already!   The employees seemed to completely hate their jobs. Like being at that place was sucking the life out of them. This is a trend I've noticed at the other Jimmy John's I've been to (and only because my boyfriend is paying).  The portion of roast beef I got had a weird green iridescence on it. I know it's supposedly "normal" for deli meats, but I think it's disgusting. What was even worse were the gelatinous sections in the meat. Not fat, but a clear jelly-like substance, which was next to some incredibly tough and chewy parts of meat that I had to spit out. Totally disgusting. Was it even real beef? Never again, Jersey Mike's has a far superior product.   Another thing to note, I live less than two miles away from this location yet it's too far for their delivery service. I joke with my boyfriend that you have to be somewhere in the Costco parking lot area to take advantage of their delivery.
