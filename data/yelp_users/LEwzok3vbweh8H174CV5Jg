This is legit, I ordered combo #2 at 2:45 pm 3-1-14 and at 3:40 pm I had to walk to the counter and ask how much longer my food was going to be, the reply was 5 minutes there is one order ahead of you. NO "i am sorry for the wait, let me see whats taking so long." Nothing. I replied with you have three minutes or I want a refund. Well 5 goes by, Ok I want a refund. It took about another 5 minutes for him to get permission from his "manager" whom may or may not have even graduated high school. At this point I have been robbed 1 hour of my life, with no apologizes, with no interaction with management, or any  sense of customer service.   There would be a zero star here if i had the option. Absolutely yummy food, when properly serviced.  I mean their was not one single resemblance of an adult in this establishment. Its like they all got high in the back and had no sense of time, or surroundings. I understand if you have a few new people that you are training. But WTF.... Oh and on the way out some one told me calm down...Me calm down you robbed my of an hour of my life, made me hungrier than what i was, and told me to calm down. That is not how you deescalate a situation.  Never again Honey bears will I treat you to my hard earned money. And frankly the gentleman before me should have been more furious than me, he called in his order and sandwich with whatever side, you handed him a bag with a side of sauce, no apologizes for him or any of your other LOYAL customers. Dam I am MAD.                                     Thanks for nothing,                                                         Augustina AKA ROBBED

You must acknowledge that this is not a sit and get served fast type of restaurant. This is a order and wait for heaven to be delivered. There is no beer, wine or liquor served here, however you can bring your own bottle of wine or beer and just charged a corking fee. Brilliant!! Well I recommend trying it out, enjoy!

I had been wanting to fix my hair color since the day I had it done. I was introduced to this salon awhile back by a good friend of mine, I had sat and talked with her a few times as she was getting her own hair done.  I enjoyed the banter she and Annie had and had always been interested in changing over, well I did. And I am DAM happy I did so. Deanne was very helpful and diligent in fixing my funky hair. She did a great great job. I enjoyed the energy she brought to the table, the well rounded conversation, and in my own appreciation there was a delightful absence of self centeredness, and the word like. Way to go Rebel Salon on the new addition.

Awesome, fantastic place.  Best place to have a conversation, by far.  The food and beer selection isn't bad either.
