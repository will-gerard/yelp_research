TL;DR: Never going back to this place after 15 years of being a customer. The worst food poisoning ever.   My review will be in 2 parts, the first for the actual food. The second for the day after.   For the record, I've been eating at Tokyo house roughly 15 years. I work close by, and I've always lived in driving distance. I've LOVED this place since a kid. It use to be run by a little old man and his wife, but is now run by new owners... This is when everything has changed.  I went here last week and ordered Beef Yakisoba, a normal go to for me. I normally ask for it spicy but went regular this time around. Normally I'm asked if I'd like rice or not (which I normally decline as the dish is suppose to be all noodles) I received my food, where immediately I knew something was different. Since there was new owners, I figured there was a new cook and maybe things have just changed. I gave it a shot..... and I've never regretted a decision so much in my life.   The normal dark consistency of the noodles wasn't there, it was a lite sauce lacking any real vegetables or meat for that matter. In total I counted 7 small pieces of beef. They added rice without asking (eh whatever) but on top of that the portions have changed fairly drastically from what it use to be. I get cutting back on portion sizes, but meat and vegetables to? What am I really paying for here? 8$ for just a bowl of noodles? The taste itself was a little sour, almost not pleasant but I kept going to see if it would grow on me. Inside of the dish were water chestnuts, which were never in before and I enjoy them so no complaints. However biting into them was sour, almost like they were opened and sitting out over night. I stopped with the food about half way through and tossed it in the trash.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Disclaimer: TMI  The following day 6am strikes me with urgency. My bodys way of letting me know to get up now before you crap the bed. The hail storm of watery half solid chunks of feces spewed from my body with such force the water splashed around in the bowl. I knew today would be a bad day, I call out of a work and attempt to go back to sleep.   Within 30 minutes I'm up again, my body calling me back to the sacred holy ground which is my toilet. The only way to describe what was happening in there was this... Imagine your a kid again in the pool and you fill up one of those water launchers and then you try to push it out with all your force. At this point I get in the shower and after I try to go back to sleep again.  30 Minutes goes by again, at this point I'm up. As I'm sitting on the toilet for round 3, the urge to puke begins. As I'm bent over the tub praying to Jesus I puke already a sensation rushes down to my sphincter. I jump into the shower and prepare for the worst. Thats when it all happens. Those convulsions you get from puking when you tense up so much you can't control the rest of your body. I release from both ends with such force. I turn on the water and it hits my back like cold little knives cutting my skin. I start to see the remains of one end of my body flow down the drain. I immediately begin to puke again.   The rest of the day was constantly running back and forth from the bathroom, dry heves, and a fever. I could of went more into detail but I figured I'd spare you all the hardship.  I will never be going back to this restaurant. 15 years and you trying to cut corners on your food has lost you a loyal customer.
