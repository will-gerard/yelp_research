It takes a lot to keep the well-oiled machine that is Horse Dog (aka my pet great dane) running smoothly. Horse Dog goes though dog beds about every month or so, and he requires state-of-the-art industrial toys, as he can destroy anything (including tires, couch cushions or shoes) in a matter of seconds.   Just when I thought that Horse Dog was also going to consume my wallet as a result of his high-priced needs, I drove by Ryan's Pet Supplies and decided to stop in. Wholesale? Pet Supplies? In a world of overpriced PETCOs and PetSmarts, this place is now my savior.  Since their warehouse is Home Depot sized, things were a little bit hard to find at first. I was overwhelmed by aisle after aisle of boxes stacked on shelves towering to the celling. Luckily the staff members here are incredibly helpful, knowledgeable and accessible. They were more than happy to guide me through the store, answer my questions and open / search through box after box until I found exactly what I wanted.   Ultimately I decided to purchase a massive human femur sized dog bone for only $9, and a giant industrial rope knot for a mere $8. My jaw dropped when the casher rang me up for a whopping grand total of $17. I would have spent well over $50 had I purchased these two items elsewhere.    And it gets even better. Ryan's also has a catalog, so I can call ahead and phone in my order. It's like take-out for dog supplies. Plus if they don't have what your looking for, they can get it for you within a weeks time so you don't have to waste a trip there.   Also, as a note to the ladies (or men too if you've got your murse in tow), they don't allow purses or bags of any kind into the warehouse. I didn't know this the first time I walked in, so they flagged me down upon my entrance. They lock your purses up in little cages, or they say you can leave it in your car...but um hello...have you seen that area?! So it's perfectly safe under the watchful eye of the cashiers. And if you seriously think that these employees are going to steal something from your purse, that they lock in a cage, in area equipped with video cameras, then you are overly paranoid.     Ryan's is the king of pet stores, and I'm one happy dog owner because of it.

Matt and I dined here for our Christmas Eve dinner. Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back.   I started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started.   For my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!  I wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience.   When I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place. It's one of those solid classic restaurants you can go to for pretty much any occasion. 5 stars to PCG!

Post sweat session at the LA Fitness next door, this Trader Joe's just starts calling my name, tempting me to stroll through the aisles and pick up some scrumptious yet healthy treats. I almost always give in, and I never regret my choice.  Safeway may have those name brand products that TJ's just hasn't quite replicated yet, but I still enjoy going to TJ's more because of their variety and fresh spin on easy to prepare meals. It's a huge plus that they are so affordable, I never feel ripped off by their prices.  Their frozen seafood section is AWESOME! Frozen bags of sea creatures (huge scallops, shrimp, langosta tails) at half the price of Safeway? I'm soooo in! The seasoned frozen ahi tuna & salmon fillets are ridiculously flavorful, juicy and high quality. Their snack section is also so much fun to peruse through. There's always some new dip or chip to try out. And I love how they have a sample station & wine tastings too!  My Horse Dog adores their peanut butter dog treats. I highly recommend these for other doggie owners as they are decently nutritious and inexpensive.   The bottom line - their employee's are just so friendly and always cognizant of check-out line lengths & open up more registers instantly if lines get to long. Keep up the good work TJ's, you make grocery shopping fun (which is hard to do in my book).

Craving authentic Cuban cuisine? Well I was, and with one trip to Havana Cafe I satistied my craving. With a small and basic interior, it is far from a glamourized restaurant. However, what Havana Cafe lacks in apperance it makes up for in substance. Quality of the food, authenticity of the dishes and excellent customer service are the factors that really make this place stand out for me.   Everything I tasted was extremely rich and packed with flavor. I ordered the ceviche, and it was AWESOME. It left an essence of piquant limes, ripe tomatoes and crisp bell peppers lingering on my tongue. I also thoroughly enjoyed their fried plantain chips with black bean dip (you've got to try it!!!!) This place serves the real Cuban deal.  The food here isn't cheap, so plan on spending a good chunk of change on your meal. Also, I'm hoping that I just visited on an off night because the mojito I ordered tasted more like a margarita as it lacked that refreshingly crisp mojito taste. It was disappointing but I'm determined to come back here and give them another chance. That way, I'll have an excuse to check out their mojito specials on Mondays!  Our server was awesome and highly attentive. The fact that they have live music is also pretty cool. Overall, this place has a lot of authentic character and that's why I'm a fan. I enjoy unique dining experiences, and Havana Cafe definitely fits that bill. So, if your looking for something different, check this place out! Your taste buds will thank you.

If you are a hunter, get your hunting gear ready because this is the place for you! Devil's Martini North is an excellent Puma and Cougar hunting ground. This desert watering hole attracts these two populations in full force. Watching them interact in their natural habitat can be highly interesting, to say the least.  Oh, and although they are in their natural habitat, these species are far from "natural" themselves. It seems as though many of them have had mutations and augmentations due to a disease called "lack of self-confidence". This disease has spread rampantly throughout this 40+ female population, and male hunters of all kinds come to watch.  Get my point? Devil's North is worthless. It's located in a North Scottsdale strip mall (near a Safeway nonetheless), sometimes they have a cover (they should pay you to come here) and what really cracks me up is that they have valet parking... yet there is an overabundance of spots since it's in a strip mall!  The patrons here are laughable. You know those guys that wear men's shoes with a heel? They come here. And you know those 50+ women who think that they are a "sexier" version of Samantha from Sex and The City? They come here too.  There are two visually disgusting occurrences that I unfortunately witnessed here - both perfectly describe the atmosphere. The first was a group of 30+ women, dressed like sleaze balls with obvious plastic surgery enhancements on display, trying to act like strippers on the dancing platform, while their 50+ husbands with orange fake tans sat on the couches nearby watching them. PUKE. The second time, it was about 8pm and the music inside was bumping. No one was on the dance floor. Well, except for two highly intoxicated 20 something girls bumping and grinding on each other while making eyes at the male hunters watching them. DOUBLE PUKE. Some patrons here are so sad that that the people watching isn't even amusing.   It's great that they have 2-4-1 drink specials but the drinks aren't anything special. I am embarrassed to admit this, but I have also eaten here as well. Don't do it. The service is average, nothing to write home about. I've waited ages for drinks/food when it's not even that packed.  Oh, and this place is so "classy" that you are not allowed to wear a baseball hat inside. Riiiiiight. Yet cougars dressed as whores are allowed to run rampant through this place? Methinks not. Pass on Devil's Martini North. Save yourself from visual torture (unless you are a hunter).

You think you know what cookies taste like, right? Well until you try Chocolate Star Bakery's creations you have no idea.  These cookies are more like cookie cakes. They're flying saucer sized, HUGE! I'm a total sucker for that cake-like texture, and each cookie has that fresh from the oven taste. Moist, rich, decadent and flavorful. My favorites are the Cranberry White Chocolate, Coconut Macaroon and Chocolate Java.  If I still lived within close proximity to this place, I probably would have started working out twice a day just to feed my addiction. Now that I live near Arcadia, it's a little bit of a drive to get here so I don't frequent as often as I used to. But when I take a drive up to N. Scottsdale, I make sure to visit the bakery, it's totally worth it.   These cookies also come in adorable little bags and they make great gifts! You can also order them online and have them delivered. When I bought my first home, our mortgage guy gave these to us as part of a present. We devoured them within a day. Well, actually, I devoured them before Matt really had a chance to eat any... they're just too delicious!

This place reminds me of a mullet. Business in the front, and party in the back.   In front, this place has all the characteristics of a hardworking, economically priced and noteworthy bagel/bialy business.  But in the back, they have a full-blown, totally stacked, BAR! Party time, baby!  New York Bagels 'N Bialys cracks me up. For the life of me, I will never understand this place. NYBB is an eerie combination of bagels and booze. Totally random and off the wall - just like my personality, and probably why I enjoy this place. I know it's hard, but try not to judge this book by its cover.  Their bagels and bialys are my favorite circular delights in the valley. I'd never even heard of a bialy until Matt and I randomly stumbled upon this spot one hung over morning. I came to realize that bialys are awesome! Instead of getting boiled before being baked like a bagel, a bialy skips the boiling part and just gets baked. Their bialys come in almost all the same flavors as their bagels.  NYBB does breakfast and brunch really well. When I used to live in the 85254, I came here almost every weekend. First of all, they make really great nonfat lattes, mimosas and road rash bloody marys. The coffee is around $2-3 depending on what espresso drink you desire, and it's cheaper/tastier than Starbucks.   From the breakfast/brunch menu, my favorite dish is the veggie omelet but all the omelets are pretty delish. They have every ingredient combination imaginable, you can sub egg whites, and you get the following sides: a bagel or bialy and cream cheese, in addition to your choice of home fries (greasy deliciousness), cottage cheese, french fries, tomatoes or a potato pancake.  I also recommend the house breakfast specials. The bagel with nova lox is to die for and the breakfast burrito is filling but it won't make you feel like an oinker. They also have egg bagels with cheese & bacon, sausage or ham! Oink Oink!  I've never been here specifically for lunch or dinner but I have tried a pizza bagel from their lunch menu for brunch. They start at $3.49, and then you can add on your own toppings for 50 cents each! No pre-made garbage here my friends, just deliciousness.   As a note, I'm only rating this place of breakfast/brunch and happy hour but FYI, they've got: sandwiches, salads, regular pizzas, nachos, quesadillas, chopped liver & bagels, potatoes and gravy, macaroni & cheese, desserts made from scratch, soups, smoked fish, burgers... oh, and they also cater.   Basically, they try to accomplish too much with just one restaurant. Food wise, your best bet is to stick to the bagels, breakfast menu and pizza bagel (the desserts look good too).  Then... after you finish business as usual for breakfast... you can come back!! Not only does this place change its name to the Rush Café in the evening but they also get the party started with $1.50 domestics from 4-7pm during their happy hour!!! Your buzz will be buzzing with wine, champagne, premium spirits and cocktails. Whatever your little heart desires!  NYBB is one of the cheapest breakfast spots I've found. The wait staff ensemble does consist of a crazy cast of characters (they are all a little "different") but they provide excellent service. Everyone here enjoys engaging customers in conversation.  Therefore, instead of giving yourself a mullet (if you do please send pictures), just come here! At NYBB you get business in the front and party in the back, without having to cut your hair.

A coworker of mine selected this restaurant as her birthday lunch destination when I offered to treat. And what the birthday girl wants, the birthday girl gets... so off we went! This was literally my First Watch - I had never even heard about this place until she mentioned it.   The inside is just as some other reviewers have pointed out, very cafeteria like yet still cheerfully bright. It definitely gives off a "Good Day Sunshine" breakfast vibe.  We sat down in a not so comfortable cafeteria style booth, and I began to scan the menu. The options looked decent but boring, and spanned the spectrum of usual omelet, egg, bacon, pancake, griddle, wrap, sandwich and salad dishes. First Watch also has "The Healthier Side" - a portion of their menu dedicated to those watching their waistline. I thought that was a nice touch.   The coffee tasted like warm water with brown food coloring in it, very unimpressive. I ordered the No. 5 - an Asian salad with chicken, romaine lettuce (yuck), wontons, cashews, cilantro and carrots with the ginger sesame dressing on the side. This salad was not impressive at all, and it needed more toppings to combat the bland romaine lettuce. I just picked at it throughout the entire meal.   The birthday girl ordered the Black 'n Blue Wrap - roast beef, blue cheese, tomato, lettuce and horseradish sauce wrapped up in a spinach tortilla. She was impressed with her meal, so maybe I should have gotten a wrap instead! However, I probably won't go back for my Second Watch to find out.   Overall, First Watch is decent. The service is fast yet friendly and the food is mediocre. The breakfasty-brunchy-lunchy menu was a step up from an IHOP or Denny's because First Watch's food isn't as greasy. So if I had to compare, I would say First Watch's menu resembles The Good Egg's menu - although I think that The Good Egg's food quality, presentation and flavor is much better.   If you're looking for a breakfast place open early in that general area, I suggest you drive a little further up Central to the Park Central Shopping center and hit up The Good Egg. In my opinion, their salads are tastier and their coffee is stronger.

I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall, especially if it's a chain restaurant. I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.  There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:  1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).  2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!    3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).  Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive.

Old Town Tortilla Factory's patio and outdoor ambiance is beautifully romantic. On a perfect Arizona evening in the spring or fall, it's an excellent spot to enjoy the comfortable climate. One star awarded.   But if you do anything besides sit on the patio, you will be disappointed. Four stars deducted.     Our server took our order after we had been seated for about 10-15 minutes. Then it was like she completely forgot that she had to actually bring us our margaritas and food. Total space cadet. We asked for things, like waters, that never came.   Call me crazy, as most people do, but I was also highly irritated by the fact that the chips and salsa here are not complimentary. That's something I expect from a Mexican dining destination. For the top shelf pricing, they could at least throw in a measly chip and salsa bowl on the house. Yeah, their tortillas with cubes of butter are supposed to replace the chips and salsa...... but tortillas and butter? Methinks not. Methinks that I'd much rather have chips and salsa!  The food is mild to bland, yet it costs a pretty peso. I ordered the "El Tesoro Del Mar" - a salad (consisting of mostly iceberg lettuce ick), spicy honey chipotle dressing (waaaaay too sugary with too little spice), pico de gallo, corn, black beans, tortilla strips and large gulf shrimp (only 4 shrimp!! and they were hardly large, more like small to medium sized!!). This disappointment of a dish cost about $15. Overrated. I can honestly say I've had a much tastier shrimp salad at Baja Fresh, for half the price and double the shrimp nonetheless.   I tired some of the enchiladas that Matt ordered, and they tasted forgettable at best. I've had better enchilada sauce from a store bought can. And then my mother, who was in town visiting for the weekend, ordered the grilled salmon. She was so unimpressed by the meal that she didn't even finish it... and she always finishes her food. It takes a lot of skill to mess up something like a grilled salmon.   As far as their margaritas go, they are good but with the $8.50 to $11 price tag I'm just not convinced that they are worth it. I've had better margaritas at places with better menus. I can honestly say that after eating here once, I have ZERO desire to ever go back.

When I first walked in to this Salon, the first thing that came to mind was T-A-C-K-Y. But upon further exploration I realized that it's tacky in an, oh so bad it's absolutely awesome kind of way. Whoever they let loose to decorate this place needs to be stopped.... just so I can meet them, give them a high-five and figure out what was going through their mind!    The perfect description for the décor of this place would be - first start with an Olive Garden, and then add a bit of Western Saloon, a pinch of Grandma's House, dash of Greek Mythology and top it all of with a modern flair. I mean this salon has a fountain of sorts in the center topped with horrific fake flowers, some Greek-style columns, a ceiling painting with vines and hidden pictures of people in the clouds, massive amourar chests where the stylists keep their hair products & tools, tons of really cool modern lights adorning the ceiling and a total southwestern feel to it.   Steven Paul Salon, you are unique and you stand out from the rest... that's why I love you!   I'm so tired of the hip, modern, trendy and un-welcoming salon where you walk out thinking... I just dropped $200+ for a cut and color that I'm not even sure I like from a snooty stylist. Scottsdale is filled with these run of the mill places. And while I absolutely hate tacky stuff, the tackiness of Steven Paul's décor draws me in. Hey, if you can be tacky and totally rock it like Steven Paul does, then I'm all about it. They also have a gift shop with interesting and very Scottsdale-esque clothing/jewelry in addition to a café that servers all sorts of coffee and lunch items.   For nails, I recommend Cyndi D. She totally rocks! Somehow my appointment didn't get scheduled correctly but she saved the day by fitting me in for a rescue me ASAP I am going to be wearing open-toed shoes for an important event this weekend and my feet look like they belong to Shreck situation.   For a hair cut/color, Mark L. is PHENOMENAL. His hair expertise changed my life. Everywhere I go, random strangers compliment my hair, that's never happened to me before... I'm a wash and wear kinda girl. To top it all of, he's just an awesome person to talk to. I hate it when someone is cutting your hair and the conversation feels forced and awkward, ugh that's terrible. But instead, Mark was hilarious and totally had me laughing and joking the entire time.   Trust me, you must visit this salon. It's pricey but totally worth it and you won't be disappointed. You'll walk out looking fabulous darling! Just fabulous!

If Mark Loposky isn't coloring/cutting your hair, you are missing out.   Mark is one savvy coloring, highlighting and styling professional. The one thing I love most about him is that in addition to his talent, he's also smart, funny and sociable. And as an added bonus, you'll also get a great ab workout during your appointment because he is hilarious.  I used to dread going to salons. I know, weird for a girl to say, right? But I can't stand the over-priced and stuffy atmosphere. I loathed the thought of spending 3 hours in a chair, watching someone put foil in my hair and then waiting for the color to dry while sitting in awkward silence because I'd rather not talk to the fake/boring stylist. But with Mark as my new go-to-guy, I actually enjoy going to a salon! He's fast, so your appointment isn't going to waste a whole bunch of time. But, he's also meticulous and detail oriented so your highlights look amazing and natural. He accomplishes absolute perfection in half the time it used to take other stylists to do an average job on my hair.  Not that I'm trying to toot my own horn or anything, but my hair has never looked this good before. Basically, I have three words for you... Go to Mark.

Although beautiful and soft, my Great Dane's fur coat can cause a lot of irritation. Especially during shedding season...  Apollo's shedding drives me absolutely nuts. The problem stems from the fact that my closet is filled with black clothing, and I own a light colored short haired half horse/ half dog. Apollo's fur sticks like glue to all of my clothing, especially my nice work clothes and jeans.   So, after reading Lindsey F's review about Seville Cleaners, I totally had to give this place a try - and I'm so glad I did! Seville Cleaners has also become my saving grace because I can get my clothing dry cleaned weekly to rid it of dog hair, all without having to drain my bank account!   I mean the dog food, toys and upkeep required for a massive Horse Dog are all expensive enough... I don't need to be wasting money on dry cleaning too! That's why this place is fabulous. My clothes always look freshly cleaned and pressed, and I'm not frantically using a hair roller on my pants every morning when I'm in a rush.  Seville Cleaners is fast (next day pick up!!), cheap ($1.99 an item) AND friendly (excellent customer service/ they've never lost or ruined anything/they let me know upfront if they can't clean a specific item). They only take cash/debit cards so make sure you've got some green in your wallet. And you also have to pay up front - which makes it easy to get in and out in a flash.  Don't let yourself fall victim to your dog's fur coat during shedding season - go to Seville! You'll look like a million bucks without having to spend it.

Matt and I will admit that we are total booze hounds. So no wonder why we love Drift. I can order a pitcher of mojitos for $20 and Matt can order a pitcher of draft beer for $9. What a steal of a deal!  Normally it costs me $10-15 for a single mojito. But at Drift, my $20 goes much further. I can get a pitcher that provides 4-5 glasses! And a pitcher of draft beer for merely $9? A lot of places charge $9 for one glass!  At Drift, the two of us can grab a comfy booth, take pitchers of our favorite drinks to the dome and drift away to the DJ's beats.   Does it really get any better than that? Actually, yes it does...  Now the next part of my story has nothing to do with the fact that on this specific occasion at Drift, each of us drank our own pitcher of booze plus some pre-gaming before our night out. We would totally do something like this sober (just ask friends, family or people who've invited us to their wedding, they've seen our antics).  Matt and I really enjoy breaking it down on the dance floor. Our moves are legendary. I challenge anyone to a dance off. We'll chew your moves up and spit them out.  Anyway, that particular night at Drift, we loooved the DJ's music because he was playing more than just the standard overplayed pop radio hits.   Suddenly... MJ's "I want you back" came on... I couldn't hold back any longer... I grabbed Matt's hand and pulled him onto the dance floor... We unleashed our moves...  We brought out the robot, the shimmy, the shake, the fax machine, the sprinkler, the arm sway, the twist down and up from the floor, the running man (just to name a few). Matt even did his famous Michael Jackson dance.  Normally, our dancing isn't so welcome at Scottsdale clubby spots where people are bumpin and grindin. Those pretty people clones just aren't cool enough to let loose and be themselves. However, the crowd at Drift is a little different. People were not only smiling and laughing (normally they just give us the stink eye or look at us like we are aliens - I mean heck, maybe we are!) but they joined us on the dance floor and started having fun too!   Then, I started the Macarena. I don't do that dance often as its special, and only reserved for specific occasions. But I felt the need to share this awesomeness with everyone. I HAD to get people to Macarena with me.  And you know what? I got a group to join in! It was awesome. People were thanking us, saying that they haven't been that "silly" in quite some time - wow I thought to myself; you must lead such a boring life! I dance like this all the time!  Moral of the story is, be yourself! And Drift has that fun, laid back, be yourself kind of atmosphere. It's a friendly spot! Of course there are some d-bags and super skanks like a usual Old Town hang out, but Drift is a little more watered down than a place like Axis (puuuuuuuke).   Drift's tiki-themed interior is pretty intricately designed with dim lighting, tiki statues, bamboo shrubbery, cozy seating and greenish blue coloring. I also really enjoy drinking my mojito pitcher out on the patio. They have awesome happy hour specials and a great atmosphere for any sized group. Every time I've been it hasn't been uncomfotably crowded either. Oh, and did I mention that I love their DJ's music?  If you're ever at Drift and you see two crazies on the dance floor, come join us! We just might convince you to join our electric slide, conga line or limbo how low can you go contest. You never know!

On my fourth visit to Grimaldi's something amazing happened. I decided to try the pesto pizza, took one bite and POW! I was blown away! This pizza place was already out of this world awesome in my mind but after tasting their pesto pizza, Grimaldi's officially won a pizza my heart.  Grimaldi's is a genuine, high-quality pizza joint that oozes class. By no means is it an over the top cheese ball pizza parlor packed to the brim like Oreganos. Instead, this place is so basic that it's luxurious. At Grimaldi's, less is more. It is quite simple really, as their menu doesn't have much on it except for pizza, salad and wine. However, I've come to find that basic/limited menus are always a good sign because that means a restaurant can specialize and perfect a specific item, and in Grimaldi's case, that item is authentic NY style pizza.  Inside, it can get very loud and very busy. On the weekends, waiting for a table can take forever but the wait is 100% worth every second. And even though this place gets packed to the brim, once you grab a table it doesn't feel packed. There is enough spacing in between tables to where you don't feel squished. The red brick interior and awesome framed photos that adorn the walls really bring this place to life.  The pizzas here don't come cheap but I'm telling you they are undoubtedly worth the higher price tag and the longer wait. With the freshest toppings and endless make your own pizza combinations, you really can't go wrong with the menu at Grimaldi's. Their crust is also to die for, and that's probably because of their amazing pizza oven and pizza chefs!  Every single time I've been here, the service has been spectacular. Yes, it has taken longer than I would have liked for a pizza to arrive at my table but the wonderful thing about the servers at Grimaldi's is that they don't ignore you or try to avoid you if your waiting a long time to receive your food (due to the fact that they are packed). Instead, they update you on your order and acknowledge the fact that the kitchen is running behind. Their customer service skills make all the difference.  Recently, Matt's company decided to throw their Christmas party in one of their event rooms, and the wait staff did an outstanding job. They were friendly, accommodating and at the end they even packaged all the extras for people to take home because there was sooooooo much food! I also have to note that they have multiple rooms for larger parties, and the cost to hold an event in one of their rooms (complete with catering and an open full bar, whoo hoo!) is EXTREMELY affordable and a total steal for what you get. I highly recommend hosting an event at Grimaldi's!  Overall, I love that Grimaldi's brings a little taste of authentic New York to Scottsdale with their superior service and exceptionally tasty food.

Bears living in the zoo eat fresher and higher quality food than this.   I was saddened at how horrific this geriatric hot spot was, and I'm definitely not surprised that this place is now closed.   Unfortunately I made the decision to try this place out. I have no idea why.   My friend ordered a sandwich. That's pretty much all there is to say about it. He ordered a sandwich, ate it, and he immediately regretted it.   I made the poor choice to select the unimpressive and soggy chicken alfredo pasta. It looked as though it had come from a can, a freshly opened can nonetheless, hence the one star. I couldn't eat it without the gag reflex setting in.   The interior made me feel strange and awkward with wooden bear figurines, bad seating, fake foliage, doily tablecloths and hanging needlepoint pictures.  Well Quilted Bear, if anything, you left a strong impression in my mind as well as some comic relief every now and then when I drive by your outdated sign--still wondering what heck possessed me to walk though those disgusting doors. RIP, Quilted Bear.

The DJ blasts a hot new remix, people stand around waiting in lines, sales girls in matching outfits walk around promoting new products, balloon decorations are everywhere and cheesy guys greet you as you walk in - Where am I you ask? No, I'm not at a Scottsdale club. I'm at LA Fitness!  This past weekend, the McDowell location of LA Fitness hosted a VIP Event. Whoever thought up this event gets no stars, in my opinion. Unfortunately this is also the second time that I've walked into this particular LA Fitness only to feel as though I've entered a club.  Because No La Fitness.... No, I don't want to listen to that blasting pop music. No, I don't want pushy sales people unleashed at me upon my entrance. No, I don't want to enter your raffle and have you stupidly call out winners with a microphone that's so awful no one can even hear what's being said anyway.    I just want to workout. Shocking, right?  But somewhere along the way, LA Fitness got lost and forgot that they are actually, really, just a mere.... average, run of the mill....gym!  For me, going to the gym doesn't equal social hour. I want to pop in my IPod and work-up a sweat, lift my weights, stretch and be done. But when you force me to listen to your noise pollution and subject me to your sales pitches, I get irritated. My IPod couldn't even drown the awful racket without causing permanent damage to my ear drums.  Funny thing is that when I looked around the gym, an overwhelming majority of people still had their IPod/MP3 Player in despite the fact that they hired a DJ.   I admit, begrudgingly, that LA Fittness does get the job done. Convenient locations scattered throughout the valley, nice pools and basketball courts, all of the equipment I need to get a well-rounded workout, great selection of classes with convenient times and decently clean facilities. Lines for cardio and weight machines can get long, and more often than not there are multiple broken machines causing frustration for members.   Nothing exceptional, but it serves its purpose. And until I have the ability to pay more per month or find another reasonably priced alternative, I'm stuck.   So FYI LA Fitness - it takes a lot more than just a DJ and balloon arch decorations to impress. Instead, focus on being consistent in the areas of gym cleanliness, equipment maintenance and facility quality. That would be a much smarter use of your time, energy and marketing dollars. Idiots.

I gave this store one last chance, and it let me down. I think it's because this store just irritates me. The unorganized piles, cramped walking space, items scattered about on the floor... it's just not shopper friendly and neither are customers and customer service associates. Plus, have you seen the lines at this place! I admit that I just don't have the patience to wait in a line that long.   Inherently I'm not a fighter and I don't enjoy confrontations. Therefore, this store totally turned me off when I walked in and it reminded me of a scene from Bride Wars where Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway maul each other to the floor. These shoppers are intense. And while I enjoy a good deal as much as the next girl, I'm not willing to walk into a combat zone just to save money on a designer outfit or purse.  Another aspect of this store I cannot wrap my mind around is that a lot of these clothes look used and just plain gross. I'm all for dirt cheap, but when the clothing has actual dirt on it... no thanks.    There are so many people out there though who walk into this store, rummage through the racks and come out with some amazing finds! I am not one of them though, and maybe I'm just not lucky enough. But more power to those who can make this store work for them.  Shopping at Last Chance feels like a job. Therefore, when a store sucks all the fun out of my shopping experience, I find myself asking... What's the point?   Sadly, I will not be returning to this Last Chance location. There are some amazing deals, but I'll leave those for the power shoppers.

This is one spot in Old Town that I always seem to overlook, and I have no idea why! I always have a great time at Bungalow, and I always leave this place saying, "Why don't I come here more often?!" Bungalow's menu is great, the drinks are strong, the indoor/outdoor atmoshpere is fun and the music rocks.   Bungalow's most noteworthy attribute would be its patio. I absolutely love it. It's one of the best outdoor patios in Old Town because you can sit out there year round. In the summer when it's a 100+ they have misters and then when it gets to be a chilly 40-50 degrees in the winter they have outdoor heaters! Actually, their porch is more like a veranda because it's partly enclosed and it extends along the outside of the building. The dim indoor/outdoor lighting totally makes you feel like you're actually in a... wait for it... bungalow! But in all seriousness, the name totally fits the atmosphere. It's like a laid back party at Bungalow, some people are all dressed up and some people are totally casual.  All of the servers and bartenders are also awesome. I've never once experienced poor service, and what I enjoy the most is that their servers notice the little things, like waters, extra napkins, etc. Their drink specials during happy hour are also pretty awesome. However, I can't give this place 5 full stars because I'm not a huge fan of their happy hour food deals. Only select items from their appetizer list are on special for happy hour, and the options are just so-so. I wish they would include all, or at least some more of, their appetizers in their happy hour menu. But, I still highly recommend their lunch and dinner menus. You have to get their crispy chicken wrap and you also have to get their seared Ahi salad. The Ahi they put on the salad is so rare, meaty and perfectly seasoned. All of their salads are so fresh, flavorful and filled with toppings you almost forget how healthy they are! The calamari is another good choice. I don't think you can really go wrong with any of their entrees, especially since everything is so reasonably priced for the quality and quantity of food that you get.      Year round, Bungalow is an all around great choice for a quick bite, lingering lunch/dinner or a night of all out partying. Next time I'm headed out for food/drinks in Old Town, I'll be sure to remember how much I enjoy this place!

FEZ... well isn't that just a snazzy little name. Those three little letters have FEZ frequenters frazzled with excitement.  Want to know why I'm caught up in the FEZ frenzy?   Well then, these are the 3 FEZ facts that have turned me into a FEZ fanatic -   F is for Flavorful. Flavorful pretty much sums up all of the food on the FEZ menu. The more dishes and appetizers I try, the more addicted I become. It's the Tomato Taza and FEZ salads that I enjoy the most - I just add chicken, shrimp or even a huge salmon fillet on top and I've got one flavorful FEZ meal. And those shrimp kisras? Yes please!  E is for Everything. FEZ is the perfect spot for everything. Lunch meetings, post-work happy hour, late-night partying, cocktails with friends, dinner dates and family get-togethers... the list goes on and on. I've even used the food on FEZ's brunch menu as a hangover cure and it worked like a charm! Not only that, but everything on the menu is also reasonably priced so my wallet never feels wiped out.   Z is for Zealous.  I have a zealous love for this place. Something about it keeps me coming back for more. The convenient location, awesome hours and take-out menu are just some of the many reasons why I adore this spot. I mean they even have different booze specials for every day of the week! What's not to love about that!   The service doesn't always razzle dazzle me though. Sometimes, even if it's not too crowded, I still have to flag down my friendly FEZ waiter. But overall, FEZ is crazy good!  Go check out this FEZtive eatery for yourself. You'll immediately see what all of Phoenix is buzzing is about!

Stingray's happy hour rocks awesome deals, great service and a fun atmosphere. Conveniently placed in Old Town and the Biltmore, each spot is ideal for post work meet ups with friends and coworkers. Both locations also have really enjoyable outdoor patios for those days when the weather isn't too scorching hot.  You can stuff yourself with some pretty tasty appetizers and sushi rolls or sake bomb the work day away for some wallet welcoming prices. They offer half off specialty drinks and sake carafes, as well as sushi rolls and food items from $2-5.  I rarely ever make it to post work happy hours that end at 6pm, so I love that Stingray starts theirs at 3pm but keeps it going until 7pm. That extra hour gives me enough time to relax and enjoy the specials.   Also just as a note, this delightful happy hour isn't offered on the weekends. Their dinner is alright, and some rolls aren't really worth the full price tag. That's why I highly recommend Stingray mainly for just their happy hour because it's a work week wonder that works well with my work week schedule!

When I think of Trader Vic's, I think Mojito. They shake up the best Mojito I've ever tasted. I crave their Mojitos almost daily... especially when it's 110+ outside. Refreshing, bubbly, minty, sweet and cool, I let out an "ahhhhhhhh" with every sip.  Since Trader Vic's is so close to my casa, I'm a happy hour regular. You'll find me waiting at their door on a weekend at 3:50 p.m. saying "open, open, open". Happy hour at Trader Vic's is held daily (whoo hoo!) from 4-6pm and then again from 9-11pm. Their 1950's style pricing fits my budget ever so nicely. I'm absolutely addicted to their $3 calamari, the wasabi ajoli sauce that comes with it is delish! My bf loves to make a meal out of the Oven Roasted Maui Burger, also only $3 during happy hour, and this burger is HUGE! I also recommend the roasted garlic hummus $2 and crispy chicken skewers $3... scrum-diddily-umptious!  As far as regular sit down dinner goes, I'm a huge fan of sea creatures and Trader Vic's knows how to serve em up right. The wood-fired Hawaiian butterfish literally melts like butter in my mouth. The Rock Shrimp Calcutta Curry and Macadamia Crusted Mahi are pricey menu choices.... but so worth the extra $$$ for a splurge.  The 50s vibe, outdoor patio & friendly waiters make Trader Vic's even better. Once I walk in the doors it feels like I'm on vacation... add in a Mojito, fresh fish, and I'm one happy Islander!

My seafood crisis began about 1.5 years ago when I moved to the land-locked state of Arizona. As a native San Franciscan, I couldn't come to terms with mediocre desert seafood. That is, until my bf Matt and I dined at Wildfish Seafood Grille for Restaurant Week.   Many AZ seafood spots strive to impress with elaborate décor, attempting to mask their mediocre food. Not Wildfish. Their ambiance and menu wowed me by encompassing all of my seafood eating requirements: FRESH sea creatures, delicious sides, impeccable service and a fancy but not stuffy atmosphere.     Neon lighting illuminates Wildfish's entrance and bar. Inside it's just dim enough to set the perfect mood. We arrived earlier than our reservation time so we sat at the bar for drinks. I ordered a mojito (of course) and to my delight it was pure minty refreshment. Bubbly and not too sweet, the bartender muddled it to perfection right before my eyes.   Post-drinks, we settled into a comfortable booth. Although the restaurant looked packed, every table was privately well spaced so it didn't feel crowded. Our waiter was professional, personable and not overbearing. He checked in just enough so I never looked around for him. He also allowed us to linger and enjoy each course. We never felt rushed.   For our appetizer we both ordered the Pacific Ahi Tuna Crudo, a dish similar to Ahi Carpaccio, and I can honestly say it's the best I've ever tasted. The dollop of radish salad in the center perfectly accented the chilled Ahi's raw and meaty taste.   My main course of Halibut was served over rice with a Mediterranean flavored sauce containing olives and tomatoes. After just one bite of that flaky, tender, perfectly seared and seasoned fish my seafood crisis came to a screeching halt - my mouth enthusiastically welcomed that mouthwatering fresh seafood taste!   Matt raved about his Seafood Cioppino, and after sampling it I could see why. Tons of succulent mussels, shrimp, scallops and crab pieces were tossed into a flavorful sauce and placed on top a piece of bread that soaked up all the juices.   We also ordered 2 amazingly tasty sides - spinach sautéed with olive oil and garlic, and crisp snap peas coupled with flavorful seared mushrooms. Hats off to the chef for creating vegetables with flair!   Dessert was delicious & decadent. My 3 crème brulees - vanilla, espresso and raspberry - tasted rich and creamy. Matt picked a chocolate mousse deep in taste but light and fluffy in texture, decorated with a tart raspberry sauce. Oh yes, I sampled everything.   I can't believe I'm actually giving a seafood restaurant located near the "Waterfront" 5 whole stars - but I did it, it's that awesome. My seafood crisis is officially over, I'm wild for Wildfish!

I like this location a lot because this Starbucks is quick, convenient and unlike other reviews I've never ever encountered an issue with my drink - a major plus because sometimes walking into a Starbucks can be a nightmare in the morning.  The crew here is lightening speed fast, and they take your order practically once you walk in the door to help get you on your way. Most of the people who walk in are in a rush to get to work, and finally I've found a Starbucks that actually understands that. This is just a cheerful place to be in the morning, it's your friendly neighborhood Starbucks.

With a swanky 60s underground vibe, the Vig is one of my fav places to go for a night out. Although they are located on a pretty busy street, they did an excellent job with the design of the outdoor area. The cinder blocks that make up the walls, the trees that hang down over the outside tables and the dim lighting/candlelight totally set the mood. The inside bar, booth and table area can get super noisy, so my suggestion is to sit outside especially if it's nice out. I also looooooooooove that they have bochi ball!   Their drink, wine & beer lists are solid, and their menu has an interesting flair to it. The double down hummus is yummy, and I also recommend the deconstructed fish taco. I really enjoy their take on bar food. Like the potato gnocchi with sautéed shrimp for example... the orange-chipotle alfredo sauce is something that I would never think of, but it really compliments the potato gnocchi and the veggies that are also tossed into the dish. I was impressed.   I'm all about places that have character, and The Vig is a great addition to the Arcadia area. It's not one of those places filled with fake people just trying to impress each other. Instead, it's a fun hang out spot where you go to joke around with friends and have a good time, and what's not to like about that?  It can get overly crowded, and the service can be hit or miss. But overall I'm a fan of this place and it's become part of my Arcadia stomping grounds. Plus, they also play awesome music and I can totally get my groove on!

If Apollo, my giant great dane Horse Dog, could talk... he would tell you that trips to this dog park make him giddy with excitement. All I have to do is mention the two words "Dog Park" and he runs to the front door with anticipation.  But since he can't talk, I'll speak for him and tell you that this is the best dog park I've found so far in AZ. Nice people, plenty of room for my dog to "horse around"and it's separated into active and passive dog areas - just so all the doggies can play fairly.  Of course, there are the occasional owners/dogs that are anti-social and shouldn't go to places like this but it's pretty easy to steer clear of those types since the park is well-sized. There a decent amount of benches to sit on, a great watering hole for the doggies to take a breather and grab a cool drink and a good amount of shade for those hot AZ afternoons.   I also have to note that there are so many friendly dogs and owners that come here, my Apollo always finds a doggie friend to play with.  Overall, if you have a dog and you live in the Scottsdale area, then you've got to give this park a try, Horse Dog recommends it!

In 1985, Dr. Emmett Brown invented time travel, and then in 2005, MSR Properties, with a little inspiration from Dr. Brown's time traveling ways, invented a Time Machine in the form of Hotel Valley Ho.  "1.21 gigawatts!"  So, if you're going to build a time machine with style, why not build it into a hotel? It's a genius idea. And if you still don't believe me when I say that this hotel is a time machine, just take one step inside in lobby. You'll immediately feel the clock reversing back to the 50s. It's a valley vintage twist on Back to the Future. A clever combination of 50s style with a new age flair.   The 50s decade is my favorite. I totally want to go back and live during that time. But I'd also like to throw in some updated elements, and Hotel Valley Ho does it all. What an excellent time machine!  When I'm at the Valley Ho, my concept of time goes out the window. That's how relaxed I am. The rooms are exceptionally comfortable and spacious. Things are simple yet exciting. Time moves slower here.  Matt and I always reserve a basic room - with soft teal, grass green, vibrant orange and snazzy reddish 50s decor and a heavenly cozy yet exceptionally large king bed covered in fun accent pillows. The bathroom contains a large shower and tons of counter space, as two people can get ready together side by side. Plenty of mirrors, spotless clean amenities and it's spacious, too! I've even enjoyed sitting out on the room's balcony while downing a bottle or two of champagne, especially when it's nice outside. For the price, it's a steal. Plus, make sure to check their Web site as there's always a special going on.   You can even find an updated Scottsdale version of the 1950s pin up girls here, just visit the pool scene and you'll see what I mean. The pool is hopping, well, during the spring/summer months at least. On the weekends they have a DJ, so it gets a little rowdy. They post the OH Pool Bar & Cabana rental info on their Web site too.   We've also rented a cabana twice, and it's 100% worth it. I stand firm in my belief that it's the best cabana deal around. The drink specials at the pool are fantastic, and the service is superior. With every cabana rental you get your choice of 3 free awesome amenities, like a fruit, veggie or hummus platter, deck of playing cards, Fiji waters... it's a nice bonus. With the refreshing misters, the luxurious lounge chairs, shaded sanctuary and prime pool access, the cabanas are a must do.   In the future, all hotels will have 5-star worthy customer service... that is if Valley Ho's staff is any indication. In today's world, most hotels have really lost that personalized touch, and they make you feel like one of many. Not Hotel Valley Ho, I always feel important here. From the front desk, to the bartenders, to the room service, it's all top notch. I've been here on multiple staycations have never had a bad experience.   I imagine that the two Hollywood darlings of the fifties, Audrey and Marilyn, would love a place like the Valley Ho. Especially since it encompasses the style and swank of a glamorous 50s hot spot. This hotel romanticizes the 50s by striking a balance between a sophisticated yet youthful atmosphere. Celebrities of the past and present have graced this hotel with their presence, and I expect this trend to continue into the future. It's a special place, and unlike any other hotel I've been to.  Anyone considering a trip to the Valley of the Sun must check out this hotel. If not only for the sole fact that it also doubles as a time machine! "1.21 gigawatts!"

Pita Jungle is one of those trusty lunch spots you can rely on to combat your afternoon hunger pains. The food is good, not blow you away amazing, but I've always left feeling happy with my meal. Plus, I give them major props for a healthy menu and their hummus is yummy.... Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus? Yes please!  Generally I order the Wood-fired salmon salad, and for about $11 I think that's a pretty good deal (especially for salmon). The pitas and wraps on their menu are in the $6-9 range, and I enjoy the Veggie Garden Wrap - it even has eggplant in it, a favorite of mine. With ample portions and reasonably priced food, Pita Jungle is a solid member of my lunch restaurant rotation.   I just wish it wasn't located in a strip mall. During lunch time the parking lot can be complete madness, and the inside can get crowded as the tables are somewhat close together.   This particular location on Indian School (I'm not sure about other spots) also has a reverse happy hour that lasts for just one hour, from 9pm-10pm (close). I thought that was kind of interesting... a one hour happy hour? That's cutting it close... but the deals are really good, $3 for a glass of wine. However the fact that it's so short makes it highly unlikely that I'll head there just for reverse happy hour, but count me in for lunch!

I fully admit that when it comes to handling my personal errands I'm one of those last minute people. Somehow, I always manage to forget things like birthdays, special occasions and deadlines. Instead of planning in advance, I wait until a couple days before and then panic mode sets in. That's why I'm a fan of this UPS Store. They help last minute/forgetful people like me not seem so last minute/forgetful in the eyes of friends and family.   I completely forgot about a family member's upcoming birthday, ran out to buy a last minute gift and then needed to ship it to San Francisco ASAP. Not only were the UPS folks at this store friendly, they were also fast AND they helped me figure out the cheapest way possible to ship my stuff. Not that UPS is cheap by any means (hence the -1 star) but everyone here was super accommodating to my, omgineedtoshipthispresentasaporelseiwillbeinhugetrouble freak out.  Normally, the people at pack and ship stores are grumpy, the lines are long and the whole experience just makes me want to scream. However I must say that visiting this store is always an enjoyable experience. Plus they have even taped by boxes for me, and didn't force me to buy packing tape like another UPS Store did. I appreciate those little things, and as a result they've turned me into one loyal customer.  I will unquestionably be back. That is unless I suddenly become less forgetful, doubtful!

I'm a newbie to the Mesa area, and I've been on the hunt for places to go during my lunch hour. Once my co-workers introduced me to Mango's  I was hooked. This is a perfect place for lunch in downtown Mesa. The service is super friendly and fast, so it's easy for me to get in and out if I'm busy. Their menu is yummy and authentic. I always leave here feeling satisfied and each dish is very reasonably priced. As a result, this spot has become a regular in my lunch destination rotation.  The tacos, tostadas and burittos are some of the highlights on Mango's menu. I can't even begin to pick a favorite because eveytime I try something new I'm happily surprised! They have tons of options, too. I'm dangerously addicted to their endless chips and salsa, and their guacamole is delicious. So, if your find yourself in Mesa and you're looking for food, you simply can't go wrong here. Mango's is great!

I started a tradition that every year for my bf's birthday we celebrate by hitting up a swanky steak house. Last year we hit up Del Frisco's in NYC, and while Mastro's cannot even come close to any NYC Steakhouse, it's definitely the best I've tasted in AZ so far... as it should be for a place with a pricey menu.   My boyfriend ordered the 8oz Petite Fillet (that was far from petite if you ask me), and I ordered the 12oz Farm Raised Salmon (absolutely the biggest piece of fish ever placed in front of me). Needless to say, the portions here are large. My salmon was cooked to perfection. Flakey, a little rare and oh so yummy. The bf devoured his fillet, he thoroughly enjoyed every bite. Then for our sides we got the steamed broccoli & asparagus as well as the creamed spinach. All 3 sides I would recommend. Fresh veggies and hats off to the chef for the creamed spinach, all of it was fabulous.   I must take a moment to also highlight their Mojito. Being the Mojito feen that I am, this one was just awesome... and SO strong! I downed one and could already feel it.   They also brought out some of their buttercake for my bf's birthday on the house. It was superb, and I could tell it probably had 5+ sticks of butter in it because it was so richly decadent. I definitely recommend this desert, WOW!   As far as atmosphere goes, I like what Mastro's has done with their interior decor. Not stuffy at all, and it has an elegant steakhouse vibe. Our server wasn't over bearing and gave us just enough service to where we felt as though our every need was catered too. Great customer service in my book.  While I'm don't think I'll be back for dinner anytime soon (my wallet won't allow it), I must say that I might venture back for drinks in the very near future. That Mojito was tasty... I'm still thinking about it!!

I have to hand it to the W Scottsdale, despite all of my pre-conceived notions regarding snooty customer service they managed to turn my stay into an absolutely amazing experience.   This past Labor Day weekend, I booked a Cool Corner Suite for my boyfriend's birthday. We arrived at 4pm, well after the normal 3pm check-in time, got the keys to our suite and hurried up the elevator to get ready for our evening out. However, when we opened the door to our suite we both stopped dead in our tracks - the room was a COMPLETE disaster! Nothing had been cleaned. There were beer bottles scattered about, towels laying everywhere, dirty sheets and lots of garbage. Big disappointment and ewwwwwwwwww!   Needless to say the two of us marched right down to the front desk to express our disgust. I was totally ready to hear a lame excuse followed by please wait here while we clean your room. However to my pleasant surprise this was far from the case! They apologized profusely, and then immediately offered to send us to the bar where they gave us cocktails and appetizers on the house.   Now it takes more than just free drinks and food to appease my dissatisfaction, so I have to give a huge shot out to Charles from the hospitality department - what an awesome manager!!!! Staffs at hotels nationwide could learn a lesson or two from this guy. While we were sitting at the bar, Charles comes over to us and apologizes again for the problem with our room. He then asks us if we would be interested in checking out another room for an upgrade since it was going to take a while to clean our previous room. We said sure, and to our surprise they upgraded us to a WOW Suite overlooking the pool from the living room and Camelback Mountain from the bedroom. AMAZING! It totally made our weekend. By that time I could barely even remember the fact that they had messed up our original reservation... I was just so excited to enjoy the ultimate luxury that is the WOW Suite.   To top it all off, they had champagne sent to my boyfriend to wish him a Happy Birthday! The W Scottsdale went above and beyond what normal hotels would do in a situation like this. We were given the VIP treatment despite the fact that we weren't movie stars or Scottsdale wannabe millionaires - and that's why I'm giving this hotel 5 stars. Charles also checked in with us a couple times during our stay just to make sure everything was going alright. It's the little things like this that show me how much a hotel cares about its guests. W Scottsdale, I will be back!  Your customer service is top notch.   P.S. In regards to the debauchery that goes on at the W Scottsdale pool, it is what it is. I'm not sure why this would be such a surprise for so many people. If you're looking for a calm desert oasis, then this hotel isn't for you. The hotel even mentions that in a gentle way on its Web site. But if you're looking for a show-off party scene atmosphere where you can get your drink on, then the W Scottsdale is the perfect place. Great people watching! And yea, the d-bag roided out guys along with the plastic too tan girls litter the W's pool side. But seriously now, these types can be found all throughout Scottsdale so it shouldn't be so shocking - just laugh at them and enjoy yourself. Don't let a couple of bimbos ruin your stay!    Thanks again W Scottsdale, and especially Charles - you rock!

Oh Sushi Roku, I really wanted to like you! I had heard such good things from friends and was so excited to finally try your sushi. But you definitely disappointed.   I mean I do come from San Francisco, where you can find some of the most amazing, mind-blowing, met in your mouth sushi... so maybe I am biased. However I can name plenty of other sushi spots in Scottsdale where you can get bigger, tastier rolls for the same price or less (like Sushi Brokers, for example).   Including our tip, the bill was about $150.... For two people!! We ordered miso soup, an appetizer, a bottle of wine (that was half off because of a Sunday special they had going on) and 4 rolls. Now I don't mind paying $75 per person if the food is outstanding, but these rolls were below average and I didn't leave feeling satisfied. Nothing to write home about.  Save your money and hit up Stingray or Geisha during their happy hour. Or, head on over to Sushi Brokers or Sushi on Shea in North Scottsdale but don't waste your $$$ at Sushi Roku. It's totally not worth the over priced menu!

Please indicate if the following points are True or False:  -   You and Matt were really excited to visit True Food Kitchen during Restaurant Week. TRUE  -   Upon arrival, the two of you were happy to be seated promptly without a reservation. TRUE  -   The cheerful restaurant décor infused you with organic, healthy, and sustainable vibes. TRUE  -  You and Matt really enjoyed sitting outdoors on the cozy patio that was artistically bordered with green grass. TRUE   -   The menu's variety of healthy and fresh options initially looked impressive and yummy. TRUE  -   It took your waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge your existence after being seated, even though the restaurant wasn't very crowded. TRUE  -   When the waiter finally arrived, he didn't welcome you to the restaurant, introduce himself or even explain the concept behind the menu that Dr. Weil & Mr. Fox created. Instead he looked bored and just wanted to know your order. TRUE   -   Waiters at Applebee's have made a better first impression than he did. TRUE   -   The seasoned hummus appetizer, topped with a flavorful Mediterranean mix of Kalamata olives, cucumbers, feta and sliced pearl tomatoes impressed both of you. However the amount of time it took this dish to make its way to your table did not. TRUE  -  It seemed like the entire restaurant staff was playing a game of "Guess Who?" - waiters kept moronically walking around with food, stopping at different tables and trying to guess who ordered what. TRUE  -   At least 4 times (it occurred so frequently you stopped counting), a random waiter placed someone else's food in front of you, and you had to tell them that they guessed wrong. TRUE  -  You ordered a salad, tofu teriyaki bowl and frozen yogurt with berries. Matt ordered the smoked salmon, steak tacos and flourless chocolate cake. It was healthy, fresh and good but definitely NOT worth the $100+ bill including a bottle of wine. TRUE  -  You both felt robbed. A much more pleasant, faster and cheaper alternative would have been to buy the wine and ingredients from Trader Joes or Whole Foods and prepare this "simple" meal yourselves. TRUE  -  A snail could have cooked and served your "simple" meal faster then the 3 painstaking hours it took your waiter. TRUE  -  The restaurant's parking validation is only good for two free hours in the lot - but the wait staff decided to play that irritating game of "Guess Who?" and couldn't serve your "simple" meal in less than two hours - so to top it all off, you STILL had to pay for parking, which was beyond upsetting after so many other let downs. TRUE   -   Although you liked the décor and really wanted to love this restaurant, you don't recommend it to anyone since you have most certainly tasted MUCH better health food. TRUE  Thank you for your responses to these True Food Kitchen statements. We are excited for when you return to enjoy more of our overpriced food and overwhelmingly bad service. FALSE!!!

Prime Seafood and Steak? Oh yes land locked Arizonians, Ocean Prime's got both. This establishment brings the ocean to us desert dwellers with some tasty steak to boot.   Decor - Bright neon blue lighting and modern clean lined architecture make up the interior. Ocean Prime screams class and sophistication. It's a swanky spot. The illuminated bar and wine cellar are both gorgeous, I want them in my home! Matt and I sat out on the intimate and dimly lit patio since it wasn't too uncomfortably hot outside. I also noticed that they had an outdoor fireplace for those cooler winter days. The tables throughout the interior and exterior looked comfortably well spaced. In the bar they had a musician performing live acoustic music, and I thought it was cool that they set up their speaker system so that the live music played throughout the entire restaurant.  Service - Upon arrival we received a happy and welcome greeting from the hostess. We were extremely well taken care of by our waitress the entire time, and also liked that the restaurant didn't mind our double fisting drinking style (when we go out, we'll generally order cocktails and a bottle of wine - sometimes waiters snicker at our booze hounding ways).  Food - I'm a San Francisco Seafood Snob. So if a desert seafood restaurant WOWs me, I'm floored. From the Restaurant Week menu, I picked the salad and salmon, Matt picked the French onion soup and filet mignon with bacon, we both decided on the 10-layer carrot cake for dessert.   My salad included some tasty candied walnuts, and I appreciated the fact that it consisted of spinach instead of lame iceberg lettuce. That salmon I ordered must have swum right on to my place it was so fresh, flaky and meaty in taste. Topped with bread crumbs and surrounded by crisp snap peas in a soy butter sauce, this fish was top notch.   Matt raved about his French onion soup, saying that the broth with onions at the bottom tasted flavorful and rich, the middle layer's crusty bread soaked up that tasty broth and the top layer of cheese was thick and perfectly browned to perfection. The fact that he downed an entire bowl of hot soup while sitting on a patio in warm Arizona weather speaks for itself!  Then there was that filet mignon that Matt ordered. Oh my goooodness! I am not a meat person by any means, but I tasted his filet and wow. I mean WOW! It melted in my mouth. That was one prime piece of meat.  The towering carrot cake was outstanding. Layer upon layer of the richest carrot cake I've ever tasted. It didn't have that yucky overwhelming carrot taste through, more like a subtle hit of it. However, it was the cream cheese frosting that made this cake so special - a creamy, buttery and sugary delight!  Another prime favorite of mine was the mojito they shook up. It met all of my mojito drinking requirements - muddled perfectly, bubbly, not too sweet, refreshing and very minty.   This is a prime spot for all you fellow land locked seafood and steak lovers out there. Ocean prime goes above and beyond to provide a well rounded 5 star dining experience. Once my bank account recovers from the pricey bill, I can't wait to go back.

Blanco is one Sam Foxy modern Mexican restaurant. I just love the interior's bluish, brownish, orange-y color scheme and the comfy outdoor patio containing mood enhancing fire pits. Hey Sam, can I borrow your Foxy interior design team to come dress-up my home? They seriously know their stuff.  Beyond my admiration of Blanco's interior and exterior design, I think this is one concept that Sam got right. By no means is this restaurant even remotely authentic, but it's not supposed to be. Good old uncle Sam doesn't do authentic. Sam does Americanized and trendy best. Even the name Blanco fits the whitewashed, or should I say Blancowashed, menu.    Sam tossed Chipotle's bland food, a taco truck, a wood-fire grill, Latin cocktails, trendy decor, and a Scottsdale scene into a blender, and Voila! He whipped up the perfect Blancoshake that brings all the boys and girls to Blanco's yard - setting the stage for some seriously entertaining, and enjoyably funny, people watching.  How's the service? Fantastic! I'm always well taken care of from the drink refills to the mid-meal table check-ins. The friendly wait staff and welcoming hostesses are all on top of their game, and even attractively well dressed. Big surprise, right? I know a couple guys who outright admit that they love Blanco for those polo dresses that the hostesses wear (an FYI for the dudes out there).   What's my favorite Blanco dish? That would be the Shrimp Fajitas. Cooked on wood-fire grill and combined with caramelized onions and peppers, the plump shrimp have this smoky, charred and blackened taste. The accompanying rice, beans and tortillas aren't anything to write home about though. All 3 taste like Chipotle's bland food. Matt always makes fun of me because I order the Shrimp Fajitas but I just eat the shrimp fajita mix with my fork. I don't even make a real fajita. It's just not worth the extra effort. Those shrimpies are too delish to be combined with just blandness.   What else to I recommend on the menu? You must try the tacos! All the meat & seafood is cooked to perfection on that wood-fire grill I love oh so much. In fact, without that grill, I don't think the menu would be as tasty.   I also must say that their Margaritas are fruity, and their Mojitos are yummy to sip on. All the cocktails are pretty much standard Sam Fox concoctions.   And what about the nachos? Oh yeah, those are scrumptious too! Actually, all of the appetizers have got it goin on. Cheese Crips - salty, melty, cheesy and crunchy. Ceviche - fresh, spicy, tangy, limey and juicy. Guacamole - perfectly seasoned, chunky and fresh avocados coupled with rock salt crystals and flavorful cotija cheese.   In fact, that guacamole is so intensely good it feels like a ripe green avocado punches my taste buds with every bite. Blanco's avocados are packing serious flavor.   What menu item should you skip? Pass on the Salmon a la Parrilla. It's just weird and at $18 bucks it did anything but impress. The salmon wasn't fresh or flaky enough, and the accompanying spinach, squash and corn mixed with chile verde was bland with a strange aftertaste. Trust me, you are wayyyyy better off with a plate of tacos or fajitas, and you'll get a boatload more food for the same price or less.  Overall, Blanco's atmosphere fits any occasion and any sized group. So... give Blanco a go!

Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat! Did I mention meat? This place is a meat lover's paradise! However, I am not a huge meat person, but my bf is... so I knew that I had to take him here. He absolutely loved it. They bring the meat by the table on huge skewers and side it right onto your plate - the ultimate meat indulgence!   My only complaint was that all of the things I really wanted to try like the filet minion for example, barely came by our table. While other types of meat like the top sirloin and bottom sirloin were constantly being offered to us. I felt like I was just waiting and waiting to try certain menu items! Fogo needs to work on varying up the choices that pass by the tables. Other than that, no complaints. The buffet was awesome, drinks were superb and when the filet minion finally arrived at our table it was perfectly seasoned, juicy and tender... yum!!

At least American Junkie is honest. By including the word "junkie" in their title, they let you know up front that they are a manifestation of the word. Also spelled as "junky" this adjective can be defined as - "having the quality (or being like) junk, cheap or of low quality" - and it perfectly describes everything about this place.  The laughably long line of people waiting to get in on a Fri/Sat night? Junky.  The bouncers? Unbelievably Junky.  The patrons you meet once you finally get inside the bar? Junky.  The food? Junky.  The too crowded bar area? Junky.  The wait to get one measly drink? Junky.  The service? Junky.  The wait staff that is more concerned about their looks than their tables? Junky.  The dance floor filled with d-bags and wannabes? Junky.  Unfortunately, I've been here more than once (not voluntarily as once was more than enough) and I always have a junky time. I don't like to waste my time doing junky things as Scottsdale has so much more to offer, and I also don't like buying junky things. Basically, it comes down to the fact that I refuse to spend my hard earned dollars at a place that continually promotes a junky atmosphere and junky customer service.

Aches and pains don't stand a chance against Judy's skills. Her massage can remedy a bad back, stiff neck and/or sore muscles. As an active individual, Judy provides me with the relief I need after an intense workout. I am so thankful that I stumbled upon Judy & Apex Bodyworx!   Before I decided to try my first Ashiatsu Massage (a super cool/ amazing/ wondrous technique where Judy uses her feet for part of the massage instead of her hands), the tightness in my lower back and hamstrings was getting in the way of my workouts. I've also tried numerous other massage therapists, expensive spas as well as deep stretching classes, and none of them can even compare to Apex Bodyworx.   What distinguishes Judy from others in her field is that she actually knows exactly where to apply pressure in order to help alleviate specific pain. There's actually a method to her massage, she's not just going through the motions or randomly pressing different places. This is what real deep tissue pain relief feels like! Plus, her prices are very reasonable for the effective and relaxing therapy that she provides. Totally worth it.  Simply put, Judy is remarkable. She has great energy, is super down to Earth, and is also extremely knowledgeable when it comes to stretching and massage. If you're in need of some deep tissue treatment (especially if you're an athlete, muscle man, muscle woman, fitness freak, gym rat or just the average Joe looking for some stress relief), skip the fancy spas, salons, etc. and go straight to Judy. When it comes to massage, Apex Bodyworx is literally as good as it gets.

I've been on a quest for a solid sports bar for a while now, and I have to say that the Tavern is my fav so far. Their menu is quite diverse for a sports bar. The Ahi Salad and the Miso Salmon are two gems on the menu, and I was shocked when I tried those dishes and they were phenominal (as far as bar food goes).  Also, their Bruchetta is delish. I know everyone always talks about the bruchetta at Postinos, but in my opinion Arcadia Tavern makes a heartier and tastier board. The spinach & artichoke bruchetta is so yummy, and during the week you can get a board of bruchetta and bottle of wine for only $20 - Now take that Postinos!   The bartenders, servers & manager all embody great customer service. This past weekend I wanted to watch some football (and sport my 49ers Montana throw-back Jersey of course), and the manager was totally accommodating when we specified that the Niners vs. Sea Chickens game was our must watch for the afternoon. He was so helpful and friendly, and seated us right next to some fellow Niners fans. Many times I'll go into sports bars and they just can't accomodiate my sports tv requests, but at the Tavern I've never had a problem!  I'd recommend the Tavern to anyone and everyone! It's a great gathering spot for friends, and they also have fun nightly specials... I mean who doesn't like a good round of Gold Fish Racing! (FYI - Gold Fish Racing is held every Thursday night, and if you haven't experienced this then you should. It's pretty silly & fun!)

Apollo enjoys the simple things in life... fresh water, kibble, tummy rubs, car rides with the window down, frolicking at the dog park, as well as walks and afternoon visits from Tim and the rest of the qualified pet sitters with Absolute Pet Care.  I feel lucky that we were referred to Tim (the owner of Absolute Pet Care) when we needed a pet sitter on very short notice over a holiday weekend. Initially I was worried that we wouldn't be able to find someone who could really care for 130 pound, Great Dane (Apollo). He's a handful. On top of that, I expect the best when it comes to Apollo's needs and spending my hard earned money. Once I met Tim during (practically the day before our trip), his professionalism eased my worries and he quickly became Apollo's new best friend. I used to be a skeptic when it came to pet sitters and dog walkers, l thought it wasn't worth it. Wrong! It's totally worth it, the feeling of comfort is invaluable. I trust Absolute Pet Care with everything!    Even with a nervous owner, such as myself, Tim knew what to do. My main concern was that Apollo wouldn't adjust to a "stranger" coming inside the house, but I was wrong again! In the free initial assessment, Tim went above and beyond my expectations, spending over an hour and a half getting to know us. Talk about detail-oriented! Beyond his comprehensive knowledge of pet care, Tim is one cool and friendly guy. One thing was blatantly clear from day one - Tim genuinely loves animals. The compassion and flexibility shown while working with a high-maintenance dog like Apollo is why this is my top pet sitting and dog walking service in the east valley. The name of his company says it all, Tim is absolutely the best!  With customized pet care instead of pre-determined prices and set services, I never have to pay extra for things like walks or clean-up should any "accidents" occur. Since Apollo can be unruly on a leash, Tim gave me some tips and used training techniques while walking Apollo without charging extra. No unexpected costs at all. Everything is clearly outlined from start to finish so I know the exact cost ans care tp expect. They leave detailed notes for owners to read upon return, watch over the entire house and take care of all the little details, like mail, packages, etc. Further, each pet sitter is llicensed, bonded and certified. Should any sort of problem occur, I know someone can take care of my dog as well as my house.  Apollo enjoys spending time with Tim so much that I now use Absolute Pet Care for dog walking during the work week. That feeling of guilt when I have a late night at work or a hectic schedule is gone. There's nothing more I could ask for from a pet sitting company. Yeah, I could pay a little less and go with pet boarding, a kennel, the kid next door, a neighbor or a friend, but these pet sitters are so much more! I know this is a lengthy review, but if your a doggie parent like me, you need details. So if your going to need a pet sitter, you absolutely should contact Absolute Pet Care, especially if you live in the Old Town, Scottsdale or Arcadia areas. Apollo highly recommends it!!

You must try the Tangerine Shrimp. My mouth is watering right now just thinking about the to-go dinner that I ordered for my bf and I from Tottie's 2 last night. Mmmmm Mmmmm Mmmmm. Scrumptiousness!  But back to the Tangerine Shrimp, it's sweet, it's a little sour, it's drenched in a blackish glaze (so don't freak out if it looks like black globs of shrimp, like I did), it's surrounded by orange slices, it's fried in tempura.... and it's amazing. Judging by looks alone, this dish does not look appetizing. But what it lacks in visual appeal, it makes up for in taste. You will be missing out if you don't try it.  Now on to the rest of the Tottie's extravaganza, we ordered:  - Kung Pao Shrimp - Fresh and crisp vegetables chopped into little cubes, tons of whole peanuts and succulent meaty shrimp in a spicy soy flavored sauce. Peanuts and shrimp in every bite!  - Scallops with Black Bean Sauce - Fresh veggies and HUUUUGE meaty scallops in the most amazingly flavorful yet light black bean sauce I've ever tasted. OMG good.  - Pad Thai with Chicken - Thai stir fried noodles (not overcooked and not undercooked, instead they were moist, flavorful and cooked to absolute perfection!) yummy fried egg pieces, crisp bean sprouts, shredded carrots, flavorful chicken (it was moist! not dry at all!), and topped with millions of crushed peanuts. Pad Thai heaven.  - Fried Won Tons - For only about $6 you get 10 of these little drops from heaven. Won tons encasing pork and formed into little ball-like shapes - I'm astounded that I liked these as much as I did, as I'm not a huge pork fan. But the meat inside was so moist! And flavorful! They came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce as well as a spicy mustard sauce, another true taste bud delight.  Now, a couple of notes before you head on over to Tottie's 2:  - Portions are pretty large. We had leftovers, but I must admit that I stuffed myself silly with food. - For the high quality of the food, the price point at Tottie's is excellent. Yeah, it's on the pricier side of Asian Fusion food, but it didn't feel like Tottie hijacked my wallet. Entree's are around $10-12 each depending on if you pick shrimp, chicken or beef (shrimp will always be the most expensive - but SO worth it, as this is high quality seafood). - Take out is an excellent option if you don't feel like eating at the restaurant. It's fast and easy. - Their online menu has sushi items on it, but if you go to the N. Scottsdale Rd location they don't serve sushi. Originally I had tried to order some but on the phone I was informed that sushi isn't on their menu - so if this is what you desire, go to the spot on East Thomas Road.  Hands down, the best Asian food I've tried in the valley. I'm officially a Tottie's 2 addict. I was so immensely satisfied with this meal, and now I'm dreaming about the leftovers I have for lunch...

What Culinary Dropout is NOT good for:  - High Expectations - You have to take this place for what it really is... a gastropub. Not a restaurant dining destination. - The Menu - Don't come here if you're looking to be wowed by the food. - Special Dinners - Don't come here for special occasions unless your looking for a bar atmosphere with bar quality service.  - The Wait - Don't come here past 7pm wanting a table unless you don't mind a lengthy wait, so plan on hanging around in the crowded waiting area/bar for over an hour.  What Culinary Dropout IS good for:  - The Bar - Consider CD a bar, not a restaurant... so pass on a table and gab a seat at the bar! It's 10x more fun and the service is excellent! - The Atmosphere - Friendly, fun and a seen and be seen kind of bar. It's the perfect spot for a night out with a group of friends. Inside, the décor is a funky and fresh combination of chandeliers and textured walls with a mix matched assortment of tables/chairs.  - The Patio - Comfortable seating and fun people watching near Fashion Square Mall. It's a prime hot spot location. - It's absolutely perfect for day drinking. - An excellent place to watch a sports game!  - Bar food - As far as bar food goes, CD does not disappoint. Yeah the food is average if you compare it to a restaurant. But compared to other bar menus... CD's menu rocks! Try the ahi salad & the trout. - Great drink selections. Get the acai mojito and try out the paper bag special! And if you love bloody mary's you've got to try theirs because they infuse their vodka with bacon! - The pricing matches the quality of the food & drinks. Don't forget that even though it's a glorified bar, it's still one of Sam's Foxy spots.

This Starbucks needs to work on their listening skills when taking orders from drive through customers. Since this location happens to be on my way to work, I'll stop by it occasionally. The problem is that they are so busy because they are located on such a huge intersection. Therefore, most of the time when I go here they get my order incorrect. And when I'm forking over almost 4 bucks for a nonfat latte, I don't want to experience issues getting my drink. Sometimes the line is also so long that it reaches all the way into the street.... I'd pass on this location as I'm sure there are probably less crowded locations that can take orders correctly!

Just last weekend I finally got around to munching and brunching at RnR. Usually I go here late night on the weekends when I'm in the bar hopping mood but this time I was hung-over, it was early on a Sat afternoon and I wasn't in the mood to wait for a table. I needed food ASAP. So, I was thrilled when I arrived at RnR and there was no wait. Score! That's hard to find on a Saturday but that also can be a warning sign for bad brunch. Well, that was far from the case...  RnR's Breakfast and Coffee menu is extensive, they've thought of everything. You can BYOB (Build Your Own Breakfast Burrito) and BYOO (Build Your Own Omelet) - can't go wrong there! I decided on the Sundried Scramble... scrambled eggs, basil, sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese. It was an A+ idea to combine those ingredients together. The potatoes accompanying the dish were pleasantly surprising. Most of the time I toss my brunch potatoes to the side because they are greasy but not this time. I devoured them as they seemed to be baked not fried, and coated in a savory seasoning.   Since I love a good bottle of wine, I also enjoy RnR for their 1/2 off any bottle of wine special all day on Mon & Tues. Their wine list does a stellar job at mapping out the wine type, body and taste just so your can find what you're in the mood for. And their frozen margaritas... Where have those been all of my life!! Seriously sooooooo good. The mango chipotle one is interesting and flavorful. Oh, and they are pretty strong too!  For an Old Town restaurant, this place has a friendly vibe. On the bottom floor they have indoor and outdoor seating, and the top floor is all outdoors. For those hot days, they also have misters that keep it decently cool.  The reason why I have to give RnR -3 stars is because their service is just the absolute pits. It's such a shame because this place could be totally rockin it if the servers remembered to check-in with their tables at least ONCE during the meal. Every single darn time I've come here, my waiter has totally forgotten to bring me my drink and it takes FOR-EV-ER to get my check. This is especially irritating when it doesn't seem to be THAT crowded at all. Ill see my waiter just hanging out talking to their coworkers while I'm thinking, are you serious right now? I hate always having to give my waiter the stink eye or the SOS arm wave in order to get some attention. Seriously now.    So RnR, brush up on your customer service skills and I'll update my review. You bum me out because your yucky server customer service does not match your delicious food and awesome specials.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 6 other times because I tried to give your restaurant the benefit of the doubt, and I will not return. Despite one experience with good service, there have been six other times when I have had  incredibly awful service. That's not a good ratio and at this point, I just can't justify coming back nor would I recommend RnR at all.  My most recent experience sealed the one star review. First, there was no one to greet us at the door and seat us. We sat ourselves. Then, we sat at a table for about 10 minutes. No waiter to be seen. No one even came around to serve the other tables around us with patrons. Ah ha! Next, we spot a waiter. After inquiring with this individual as to where our waiter was/if they were closing or something (trying to give them benefit of the doubt) the waiter looked at us begrudgingly, gave us a half eye roll and said, "I guess I can serve you."  Well, after that remark I just wanted to get up and walk out. But I stayed (a decision that I now regret) only to experience more poor service.   We needed more drinks, our waiter was nowhere to be found. Then we noticed all the waiters hanging out near the order input computers. The restaurant wasn't crowded, and I know my order wasn't being taken or put into the computer... instead it looked like social hour. Unprofessional.   This is not the first time that I have experienced inattentive and no-where-to-be-seen service at RnR, and I guess I should have known better. I don't even think my request to be seated so that I could have a waiter take my order was THAT outlandish.  I work very hard for my money to be able to enjoy some "RnR" on the weekends. So, with lots of other places (like AZ88, Old Town Tavern, Mabel's on Main, Firehouse, Pattie's, The Lodge, Geshia-A-Go-Go, and the list could go on) where I can count on being served... by an actual live body nonetheless... who doesn't even make me feel like they hate me just because I walked through the door... there's no reason to come here.  It was especially awful to be treated so poorly when I'm a Giants fan, and my team's flag is hanging out front of the establishment!! I'm going to pass on anymore of this place's "RnR," as I'm pretty sure it actually stands for "Really Rude" service.

Finally, I've found the creamy, decadent, flavorful fro yo I've been searching for! Zen Zen's yogurt is absolutely divine. I savor each and every bite! The toppings are pretty standard as far as fro yo places go, so they have it all. My absolute favorite topping is the incredibly delicious nutella. For me, it's the consistency and smooth texture of the yogurt that really makes this place stand out among the rest. The selection of yogurt flavors usually varies from visit to visit. My favorites are the chocolate milkshake, red velvet and last but not least, cinnamon buns!! Since there's still a lot of summer left, I plan on heading back here to sample as many different flavors as I can... strawberry lemonade, mint, mango, plain tart... Yum!!

It was a tense and crucial situation. My usual Scottsdale sports bar lineup was not producing, and I needed a place to watch the NLCS. What to do? Well, I turned to Blue. "You're my bar, Blue! You're my bar."  I'm one intense Giants fan with certain game watching behaviors - sometimes I wear eye black or paint my face, I may jump around a lot so I need a little space, I get decked out head to toe in my team's colors, I'll curse and talk to the TV under my breath, I'll cheer with excitement, I may bite you if you block my view of the TV (just kidding, or am I?) and I like to heckle anyone who isn't rooting for the same team as me. What can I say? I'm fierce and I love the game. My father raised one heck of a sports fan. I've got a lot of pride in my team, and not every sports bar can accommodate my love for the San Francisco Giants.   Furthermore, I knew I needed some pop in my Scottsdale sports bar batting order but I wasn't quite sure where I was going to find it. I had heard about this Blue character but I didn't know if he would cut it in my MLB - Major League Bars. Well, Blue threw on his # 32 jersey and proved to be an All-Star player by coming through in this clutch situation. Blue 32 is a quality bar with an exceptional atmosphere. What a great acquisition! Blue 32 covered all the bases.  Base One - Blue possesses great range in the outfield by strategically placing a ton of TVs throughout the restaurant. TVs galore! Every spot is manned and defended by a TV so it's impossible to miss a play. These huge TVs provide great visibility from all angles. That way, there are less call discrepancies. I can see all the plays up close and personal, allowing me to critique a pitcher's pitch, a batter's swing or an ump's call.  Base Two - Blue's wait staff turned multiple 6-4-3 double plays because no one dropped or boggled the customer service ball. The bartender, the hostess, the servers, et al were attentive, friendly and fun. This gold glove caliber defensive team is on top of their game. Blue 32's service may even earn a spot in my Major League Bar Hall of Fame if this excellence continues.   Base Three - Blue 32 hit a grand slam with a delicious and high-quality yet reasonably priced menu. The food was excellent and definitely a home run with Matt and I. Matt ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy, which he raved about. And I'm not a sandwich person but this one looked so good - packed to the brim with crispy shrimp and accompanied by some real stand out onion rings. I ordered the grilled salmon dish with rice and broccoli, and I was shocked. Not by the rice and broccoli, as it was good, but my goodness it was the salmon! For about $15, this salmon is blacked and grilled perfectly, not over cooked or chewy at all and it was so moist! Bar salmon that actually tastes good? I'm in.  Home Base - Overall, Blue 32 just has a superior sports watching atmosphere. It gives off high class sports bar vibes as its sparkling clean compared to other places. I am so excited to come back that I'll probably skip a couple of the other bars in my rotation. The décor, lighting and seating are all set up for an ultimate fan like me. This place even has excellent parking, a wonderful patio and the interior is large but it isn't gaping. It's the perfect size. I even love the full-size bar area with lights underneath. On one of the walls there's an awesome sports ticker with stats and breaking news. They also have an excellent happy hour with really fantastic deals from 4-7pm, so it fits my after work schedule. Even their cocktail, beer and wine menu gets the job done.  Well Blue 32, your versatility has earned you starter status. I'm counting on you when I've got some serious game watching to do - and you better not disappoint. Your 5 star contract is riding it. I've got high expectations, and a great feeling that you'll succeed as the big bat in my Scottsdale sports bar lineup.

Blue 32 wins my MVP award. I practically lived at this place during the Giants World Series run, and loved every moment of it!   Despite the fact that I am still stuck in an orange and black-out World Series Championship daze (that will probably continue for at least another month or so), I must up the rating of this place to 5 stars because Blue 32 is now my favorite sports bar in all of Scottsdale. The service is top notch and the atmosphere is excellent for game watching.  Here are the main two reasons why I will keep coming back here: 1. Food - This is the best bar food ever! You must try their onion rings, they are crazy delicious. Also if you aren't in the mood for fried food they have tons of healthy options as well. 2. TVs - Sports fans, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to TVs. Outstanding visibility from every angle of the restaurant. No sports bar in Scottsdale can compete with Blue 32's TVs.  Go here for a game and you won't be disappointed. I decked myself out in orange and black, screamed, jumped around with excitement and just all around enjoyed myself while hanging out in the bar area during the games. Overall, Blue 32 is a high quality sports bar and you've got to check this place out!  P.S. GO GIANTS! =)

That's A Wrap is my #1 fav lunch spot and I'm so happy that they moved to their new location at 800 East Camelback Road! FINALLY the parking issue has been resolved! You can now officially park your car without being worried about getting blocked in - a common problem at the previous location. I had a coupon for $2 off, and decided to stop by the first day they opened the new spot just to check it out... the line was out the door. No joke that is how scrumptious this place is. The staff is also really awesome and friendly - you can tell that they are appreciative of their loyal customers.   The My Sherry A'more wrap is heaven... Freshly sautéed spinach & onions, ripe roma tomatoes, tasty feta, juicy button mushrooms and grilled chicken bathed in a zesty sauce and bundled into a tomato/basil tortilla! Usually I don't like wraps because they tend to be dry, but That's A Wrap knows how to do it right! I would also recommend their rice bowls as well, so delish (specifically the veggie bowl & bangkok bowl). Also, if you are a fellow tofu fan, you MUST sub tofu in your dish. They grill the tofu, and it is oh so good! Even though you'll most likely have to wait in a long line for your food, it is so worth it.   My advice is to call ahead with your order, so that if you do have to wait in a line to pay at the register you don't have to wait again for your order to be made. I would also recommend hitting this place up early or after the lunch hustle and bustle, that way you can call ahead and avoid the line all together.  BTW - Love the new outdoor patio! Great seating and the atmosphere is casual. The perfect place when you need a workday break from being stuck inside an office.

I was in desperate need of a spot to watch Game 1 of the NLDS Giants vs. Braves series, so Matt and I thought we'd check out Firehouse. When we walked in decked out in our Giants gear, I suddenly realized that we might not be so welcome at this spot... not only is the owner an Atlanta Braves fan, but there were multiple other patrons sporting Braves gear as well. Great, I thought to myself, I managed to pick probably one of the only Hotlanta sports bars in all of Scottsdale!   But instead of giving us the cold shoulder, the owner, named Justin, was absolutely one of the most welcoming, friendly and entertaining guys I have ever met. I mean what an awesome guy, well minus the fact that he's a Braves fan... just kidding. ;o)  Anyway, Matt and I had a great time here. We will for sure be back (probably to watch the NLCS because yup, that's right, the Giants beat the Braves!), and here's why:  1. FOOD - It's delicious. I would categorize it as high quality bar food. These dishes actually require more preparation than just being dropped in a vat of oil, and not everything on the menu includes the words "crispy" or "fried". Their salad menu really impressed me. I ordered the Greek Salad, it was healthy and scrumptious - packed full of kalamata olives and perfectly blackened grilled chicken, as well as topped with a light and flavorful dressing. It's a Mediterranean delight! Maybe it had a little more iceberg lettuce than I would have liked, but the ripe tomatoes and crisp cucumbers included in it made up for the iceberg. Matt ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza - and wow, this was one amazing pizza! I may go as far as to say it's one of the best Pizza's around. This massive personal pizza pie isn't greasy, and it has just the right amount of sauce to cheese to toppings ratio. Now I am salivating just thinking about it! Oh, and we also tried the hummus appetizer... it was all kinds of yum!  2. ATMOSPHERE - There is literally a fire truck inside that turns into a DJ booth at night! I love quirky characteristics like that. And everywhere you look there's a huge flat screen TV. Talk about a sports watching paradise. There are even comfy couches with tables where you can relax and watch the game. Firehouse is a multifaceted breakfast-brunch-lunch-dinner-happy hour-sports bar-late night hangout-DJ dancing spot. It's very versatile.  3. SERVICE - Ehhhh, our waitress left much to be desired however I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because for one, she outright announced that it was her first night on the job and two, well this place had only been open for less than a week when we went. So I'm cutting them some slack. I'll update on the service my next time around, which in all honesty could be as soon as this weekend.  4. THE OWNER - You can tell that Justin put a lot of work into this place. I absolutely love it when owners show their face and mingle with their patrons. It means that they actually care about business.  5. SPECIALS - You've got to go here for their happy hour deals! I'm a huge fan because their happy hour starts at 4pm and keeps going until 8pm! For a working woman like me, that is an optimal happy hour time slot. Happy hour specials include half price appetizers and $4 well drinks. In addition, from opening until 10pm, domestic/import bottles of beer are a mere $3!   This place is just cool - from the low ceilings to the intriguing bar and the dance floor, it all screams fun! Minus the fact that it's an Atlanta Braves bar as well as the official bar for Dallas Cowboy fans (can you say puke? sorry, I'm a lowly niners fan) this place will unquestionably be in my old town bar rotation, especially when I'm in the mood for some sports bar time!

Dear Firehouse,  It's quite apparent that you have an identity crisis going on. Are you a late night hangout spot? A sports bar? Maybe a club? Or a brunch/lunch/dinner spot? Well, I'm a little confused so I'm not even going to try and classify you, because you know what? Your ability to morph into any type of venue depending on the time of day is what makes you so awesome.   Old Town didn't need another lame and pretentious club. Therefore, you are the perfect bar/club/restaurant hybrid that breaks the regular Scottsdale mold. I consider you my #1 choice when it comes to the Old Town nighttime scene because I don't have to deal with as much Scottsdale sleaze or attitude. I'm also a big fan of your food. It's excellent as far as bar food goes. Oh, and I can't forget to mention the music because the DJ knows how to mix it up with style. I absolutely love the dance floor... it's fantastic.  I could also sit in those comfy red leather couches forever while watching the multiple big flat screen TVs that adorn all of your walls. Yeah, you may kick me out of my cozy couch once you morph into night club mode but that's just the price I have to pay for enjoying a spot as unique as you are.   As far as Old Town bars and clubs go you are indisputably as good as it gets. Firehouse, you are perfect just the way you are - please never ever change.  xoxo, Lindsey  P.S. My wallet would like to thank you for having some of the best drink/food specials in Old Town. The fact that happy hour lasts until 8pm is awesome!

I was here this past Saturday night for a friend's bday, and I had an absolute blast! Don't get me wrong, Firehouse is crowded and the line can be long... but it is actually worth the wait to get in.  The DJ? Fantastic. The atmosphere? One of the best "clubby" scenes in Old Town. The staff? Suuuper friendly and attentive. The food? Delicious (as far as bar food/late night grub goes). The dance floor? Well, that's where you'll find me... seriously this place always has the best music!!  Firehouse has that seen and be seen atmosphere so I wouldn't recommend you come here if you're looking for a place to hang out and talk with friends. But if you're headed out for a big night on the town or if you're in the mood for some dancing, come here!  I must admit I also loved the orange and black balloon decorations everywhere and I can't wait for baseball season to start up again. I know where I'll be headed when it's time to watch some regular season baseball games, Firehouse! Especially ATL vs. SF =)  So thank you Firehouse staff for another awesome night out, and I'd also like to thank Justin for helping to make my friend's bday so much fun! You rock.

I'm usually skeptical when a restaurant claims to have very healthy food that's under a certain amount of calories because the food is either, A. Served in kiddies sized portions so you end up snacking later on in the evening anyway, or B. Dull and flavorless.  And I'm happy to report that Season's 52 was surprisingly good! Very well sized, flavorful portions!   Here are some highlights of my experience at Season's 52:  - VERY reasonably-priced - fresh, seasonal ingredients - crisp and well-seasoned veggies (the asparagus was omg good) - excellent menu variety (highlights were the trout and the sea scallops - both were HUUUUGE - they didn't skimp on the scallops at all) - healthy - yummy appetizers (get the stuffed mushrooms) - too tasty to be under 425 calories!! - wonderful, attentive service - great wine selection - scrumptious mini-desserts  The best part is that you can reserve your table online at opentable.com, to avoid the wait. We had ZERO problem with our reservation as we were promptly seated upon arrival on a Saturday night. Yes, it is a chain, and yes, the interior resembles a dressed-up Olive Garden. However, despite those two qualities, Seasons 52 decently delivers as a middle-of-the-road, quality restaurant that will fit quite nicely into my go-to dining out rotation.  As far as healthy eating in the Biltmore area goes, this place is 10 times better than it's overly trendy (and overly awful) healthy food restaurant neighbor True Food Kitchen.  At Season's 52 you get excellent service, and a MUCH tastier menu with a variety of choices that put True Food Kitchen's menu to shame. Plus, you won't walk out spending as much!

If I had to describe my "workout personality", I'd say that I am someone who enjoys working out on my own. I think of exercise as my alone time where I can clear my head. Therefore, I have been completely blown away by Pure Barre. This place has turned me into a total devotee, and for the first time ever, I have truly become addicted to an actual workout class!   About a year ago, my world turned upside down when I suddenly found myself crippled by an overuse/muscle imbalance injury. Both of my knees were completely shot, and I could barely walk from one room to the next without buckling over in excruciating pain. At the ripe old age of 26, I was saddened by my lack of mobility. I've been extremely active all my life, and putting my usual running and weight lifting routine on hold really upset me. While I was prescribed a lengthy course of physical therapy, it just wasn't enough. I needed something to get my heart rate up and keep me from going crazy. My physical therapist suggested I try yoga or Pilates. I checked out a couple of different studios in the valley but I dreaded going to class. I want to sweat, and sweat hard when I exercise. Therefore, yoga and Pilates just didn't suit me. Still desperate to find something that I could at least tolerate, I started looking into barre classes.  Before my first Pure Barre class, I went to the two other barre-type studios in the valley. And while those two other studios got me excited about barre-type workouts, I wasn't a fan of the actual studio environments. I felt uncomfortable and awkward going to class, and for me, I need to feel comfortable or else I will avoid the class like the plague! On my third attempt to find a barre studio, I went to check out Pure Barre. I guess that old saying really does hold true, the third time is most definitely the charm! I fell in love with Pure Barre instantly.   I enjoy Pure Barre so much because it's a workout that actually works. I saw results, felt better and stood taller after my first 10-15 classes. The strengthening and lengthening changed my knees for the better and accelerated my recovery. Plus, the music is fantastic and super motivating. But the main reason why I adore this studio is because the instructors are unbelievably awesome, and they actually make me feel like more than just a face in class. I love the personalized attention and how they correct my form without having to call out my name and single me out in front of the entire class (other studios did that and it drove me nuts). Instead, the Pure Barre instructors just quietly walk around the room and gently correct everyone's form. This makes the setting so much more comfortable and relaxing. It allows me to zone out and really focus on the movements. And, I couldn't even pick a favorite instructor if I tried. All of them rock! The owners (and sisters), Veronica & Marirose, are also extremely welcoming and incredibly sweet. It is very clear that they know and care about all of their clients.  The fact that this studio turned someone like me (who avoids group workout classes AND has bad knees) into a regular attendee, exemplifies the power and effectiveness of the Pure Barre method. It's a high-intensity workout that gets results and is gentle on my knees. I couldn't ask for more!  It's now been about a year since my first Pure Barre class, and it just keeps getting better and better. My advice? Stop thinking about it and give Pure Barre a try!

Chipotle burritos are equivalent to a flavorless monster missile burrito gut bomb. Their professional and impeccably clean cafeteria style food assembly line can produce some of the biggest burrito beasts I've ever laid eyes on.  However, it's important to remember that bigger doesn't always equal better.  Although the diameter and circumference of their burritos beats the competition, the favor does not. For a place with such a spicy name, Chipotle's food just doesn't have the piquant flavor I desire.  I need some zest! Some spice! Get this senorita to say, Ole!    The chicken is also to dry for my liking and the gristle left in it makes me gag.  I know I know, I could go the vegetarian burrito or taco route since I'm totally grossed out by their meat... but those have even less flavor! I've tried. The veggie fajita mix could have so much potential... but it falls flavorless on my tongue.   Alas, I must say that the mighty dollar goes a long way at Chipotle. Their prices are reasonable. I mean they give you a whopping burrito the size of a small dog! But then again, like I said before, size isn't everything.  Chipotle also offers healthier options like salads and burrito bowls but I don't think I'm headed back there anytime soon to give those a go. They just include the same lame ingredients as that boring baby sized burrito... so I think I'll stick to Baja Fresh and Rubios.  Unfortunately I ate a Chipotle burrito for lunch yesterday and it sat in my stomach like a rock, making me feel slow and lethargic. I think Chipotle's food just doesn't match my taste buds. I know a lot of people who really enjoy their food!! However, I am not one of them. I would rather say bombs away to my stomach with something just a little more flavorful... and maybe smaller in size.   Boy oh boy was that burrito huge!!!!!!
