Really amazing food and generous portions! I used to come to here with my boyfriend for burgers since it's right next to my house, but then we decided to go vegetarian because of pollution, cruelty, health ect. and had to stop eating here because their were hardly any veggie options and we were never given a straight answer about whether any of the products were local. Vegetables aside, this place is definitely worth going to if you want good food and want to meet great people.

It takes at least 30 minutes to get through the drive through, the service is bad, and the burritos are almost always made incorrectly. It costs about $10 for 2 bean burritos and they're always running out of beans. I come here because it's 24/7 and right next to my house, but I think at this point I'd rather eat crumbs off the floor.

My boyfriend and I came here for the first time for dessert! It was recommended to us by a few friends in the neighborhood, but despite all of that we never went until now and I don't regret it one bit. The building was very comfortable, great atmosphere and people. Our server was a pretty nice guy and our food was delicious. Plus, it's in walking distance from our house! Ten-outta-ten would eat again.

Good food but the service is really bad. I understand having a cool kid atmosphere, but we waited a good 15 minutes for our check and another 15 for our money to be taken. We probably could have just left and no one would have noticed. We might come back because we live right next to it, but we have better options, service wise, near by.

This car wash didn't clean my car at all. It left foggy streaks on all my windows, but I have been to the other clean freak locations on 44th St and another on 15th ave and those were just fine! Plus, the corner smelled awful and a crazy person was harassing me while I was trying to vacuum my car which was super uncomfortable, especially since the staff knew he was there and didn't remove him from the scene. Biggest waste of money in the franchise.

Not gonna lie, I practically live here and therefore have nothing but good things to say. The coffee is the best in Phoenix! It's what got me hooked. The Toddy is top notch, very smooth, unlike a lot of other places *cough Starbucks cough cough* near by. I personally really like all the HIPSTERS, which seems to be the biggest complaint on Yelp. I don't entirely understand why people don't like being around hipsters and artists that's the point of being downtown! That's also what Jobot is built off of, right? Hipster-ass art. I could go on a whole rant about how the people created a culture and what not but for the sake of the review, I won't. (But they totally did so don't talk down on hipsters!)  Also I really love the BARISTAS and the CHEFS. Gonna throw out some names and say that KJ and Simon are the nicest people to ever live and serve and the owner and his wife, John and Crystal, are extremely involved in the community and will be always be seen with family and friends. Now onto the FOOD! Everything is better with chorizo, which is lucky for me because everything has chorizo (want to be veggie instead? Get black beans!) The burrito somewhat reminds me of Chipotle, if they were, actually a Mexican restaurant, so it's great! You can also get dessert crepes here with everyone's favorite spread, Nutella! Or ya know, you could go to Melt. down the sidewalk for some fancy takeout rose ice cream.

I practically live here, it's so good. .-. I've brought all my friends and family members here and now they come all the time too! Their pizzas are no doubt the best in Phoenix, plus they have a local vegetarian pizza too which is a bonus if you really want to support local business! The owner and the staff are some of the nicest people to work in food service as well. They're very friendly, attentive, and attitude-free (a quality rarely seen in the food industry). Plus, the location is great! It's within walking distance of my house and is also very close to downtown, so you can go there after 1st or 3rd Friday. They also have specials everyday which is a big motivator to eat there frequently. I give Humble Pie a ten-outta-ten, would eat again.

Great food, we got two pretty basic breakfasts (eggs toast bacon ect) and the huevos rancheros special. They were all really good, especially since they came with a house made jam, cage free eggs, and some locally roasted coffee (cave creek roasters, a great place). The house potatoes had a lot of great flavor, but I personally think they had a little too much Rosemary. That's a personal preference though. The service was good too, the people were friendly and the drink refills were en point. The reason why I give the place 4/5 is because I think he atmosphere was lacking. The place isn't very comfortable. Aluminum chairs are super loud, lighting is very industrial, we could see into the kitchen which wasn't the most pleasant view, and could hear every single thing the servers were talking about from across the room. It wasn't busy either, only one other table, so the sound was ridiculous.

My boyfriend and I have been exploring Phoenix for the past month for good food. We're really glad we found this place since it's close to our house and has an amazing happy hour. We sat at the bar where the chef served us some high quality sushi (I mean, it was $3!) and was very friendly.  My only complaint was that the servers weren't very attentive, there were two and they just a followed each other around. They also spend a lot of time on the restaurant side of the bar and paid nearly no attention to the side with the sushi bar (it was full on both sides). We were finally asked if we needed our checks about 20 minutes after we had finished eating. I get that it was busy, but seriously, they could've just parted ways to cover more ground.

Great specials every Sunday and Wednesday made by the chef! Sunday brunch is always fantastic- with cool creations like a breakfast sandwich on a waffle!

Went here for the first time today! Outside has a badass mural and inside had a surprising amount of plans for a new nursery. The two guys that helped me were very nice and helped me look around, a lot of times I'll go to a local place and the employees will be sassy because you don't know everything about the products, which is lame, but that was not the case here. Also, its 4 streets away from my house and pretty cheap, high quality plants for a low price I mean. I'll definitely be coming back and recommending this place to anyone who needs some plants!
