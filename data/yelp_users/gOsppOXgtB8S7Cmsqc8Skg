Somehow Houston's clones its servers and ambiance across state lines with ease as I felt like I was in the Houston, TX location here. The food was spectacular as always and I must hype up the chicken tenders, which I order everytime I come to a Houston's. It is in a light tempura batter and the chicken itself is super moist and tender.. paired with a honey mustard dipping sauce and you have quite the duo. FYI, its not on the menu, but you can still order it.. its the best thing on their menu imo.

Every room here is a suite..   Mine was multi-leveled making it seem larger than it really was. The bed was very comfy and had some bling bling all over it. I had an urge to steal everything and put it in my room at home.  I love the entrance of the hotel as they have paintings all over the ceiling and great service from the workers. I'd give this a 5 star if it weren't so far away from the center of the strip. Oh and I pricelined this hotel back in the day when you could get it for $99 a night.. I wonder if I got the "Priceline" room?

I already don't like buffets so when I came here after having to wait in line for 40 mins I was seriously disappointed. Most of the food was just standard fare with some of the Middle Eastern stuff being interesting. Unlike the Bellagio where I ate until I felt like my stomach would pop I ate very sparingly here.  The only memorable thing that happened here was my friend telling me that he wanted me to go with him to the 24 hr marriage chapel to be the witness (and take pics) so he could get hitched with his girl that nite..  while I was trying to get some lamb chops..  it seemed kinda surreal at the moment.

Both time I've seen this show I've paid through the nose for it..  but its totally worth it! The first time I saw it I was in the second row.. you could see all the detail of the the performers but not see the whole grand scheme of things. The second time I saw it I sat in the middle area.. I like it MUCH better b/c I could see the whole stage and all the little things they have going on in the back, sides, etc.  Onto the performance..   Its very dreamy like b/c the water stage emits a bluelike aura while these fishlike people fly around in the air. The whole moveable water stage concept is genius..  I'd love to run up there one day in the middle of the act and flop around like a fish out of water.. the audience will think its part of the act! =)

Very interesting show..    not sure what I got out of it except for that these guys' eyes must get tired from extending their eyelids out like that for 2 hours. I sat in the front row and got pelted with their banana mixture..  definitely an interesting experience. The music with the PVC Pipes are interesting as well..  although this probably isn't something I'd pay to watch twice..  unless one of them tore off their skin suit and out popped a nude and drunk Jessica Alba.

My friends and I kind of came into this place randomly.. I thought it was going to be just another bastardized P.F. Changs type place but wow was I wrong. The whole place is run by peeps from Hong Kong.. including the cooks. Every dish we ordered was authentic and very good. Prices are a bit steep for chinese food but hey, we're in Vegas.. stuff just costs more here. I wasn't able to try out the dim sum but I'm sure its top notch just like their normal dinner food.  Food: 9/10 Service : 7/10 Ambience: 7/10

Loved the desert decor of the hotel and the suite itself. The beds were super comfy and well insulated from any sounds from outside. There is free wifi and two water bottles to take (well not technically free as there is a $15 resort fee). There is also a one mile walking trail surrounding the property which is nice if the weather permits. Also, the maids never bothered us in the morning which happened at other places we stayed at on our road trip.
