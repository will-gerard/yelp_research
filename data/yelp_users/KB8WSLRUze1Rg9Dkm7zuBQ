I took my car in to get my brakes checked.  I ended up getting new front brake pads and new front rotors for my car. (Probably just needed new pads and not rotors)  After driving it home, I noticed that it just didn't feel right and thought to myself that it must be because it was new.  The next day when I drove the car, i started hearing scratching noise every time i pressed on the brakes.  It was really bad and I thought my brakes were going to fail.  I was going to to take it back to Brake Master but they were closed on Sundays so I took it to another shop that was opened.  It turned out that Brake Master forgot to screw in the bolt in the back of one of the calipers and that was the reason for the noise.  Basically the caliper was hanging and rubbing the inside of the wheels.  My right wheel is now damaged from the caliper rubbing.   I got a new bolt which fixed the issue.   I took the car back to Brake Master and explained to them what happened.  The manager offered to pay for the bill from the other shop and a free oil change.  The damage on the wheel was not noticeable unless you look closely.  Thanks goodness I brought it in right away to get the issue fixed.  I would not recommend this place for the horrible experience I had.  Thank goodness no one got hurt from this brake job.  This was the first and probably the last time I will come back to any Brake Master.  If your name is called "Brake Master" wouldn't it be the service that your perform the best at?  Forgetting to put on a bolt on the caliper is inexcusable especially because the caliper is so important to the brake's functionality.  I will try to spam all social media about my bad experience at Brake Master.

This is a great place to workout.  I am on my second week of the 4 FREE weeks and it has been amazing.  Jennifer remembers your name the first day you join.  The workout is never boring and she has you working out all your muscle groups.  I love working outside.  It can be cold sometimes in the morning but I have learned to dress accordingly.  This is a one hour workout, not 45 minutes or 50 minutes as i was expecting.
