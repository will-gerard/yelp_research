I must be honest, I am not much of a wine guy, but I came here with friends last week and had a pretty good time. The sandwich I had was huge - really big. The waitress kept bringing more and more food in quick time, and the wine wasn't too bad either. I'll be back.

Whatever you do, don't start a tab here or use card!!! And if you do use a card, pay at the bar, per round!!!! The place is beautiful but the staff forgets that people are coming here to enjoy themselves and they aren't really inviting, specially the bouncers ...  I'll pass and so should you ...
