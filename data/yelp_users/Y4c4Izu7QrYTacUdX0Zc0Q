Fun dive bar with great atmosphere when you're completely wasted. But I went to watch a packers game because it's advertised as a packers bar. We had to ask them to change the channel to our game and ask repeatedly for them to turn down the music so we could actually hear the game. Their solution was to turn the volume up on that one tv, with music still blaring all around us. Luckily, they figured it out once the game started. Then after about one quarter into the game, the sound was changed over to a baseball game. Our server was not friendly in the least and even blatantly avoided our table. There were about 10 people in the bar and we were the only ones who ordered food, yet it still took about 30 minutes to get our nachos. And they were the absolute worst nachos I've ever had. Now I know why I've never been here sober.

This place is such a hidden gem! It definitely has the feel of a speak easy in the 1920's. I love that the entrance is in the back and the inside looks like you're really underground. The live music was great and the singer was AMAZING. I went on a Thursday night and it's the perfect place for a low-key fun night out or a date. It's dimly lit, with a very warm romantic vibe. We got a red wine flight with the cheese fondue and warm olives. The wines are really good and the fondue very tasty. The olives were surprisingly the most delicious part. They are packed with flavor and the perfect compliment to the wine. The bartenders were all very attentive and everything was served quickly. I would recommend this place to a friend and I can't wait to go back!

I love love love US Egg! Everything is delicious and the service is really quick most of the time. The Idaho skillets are amazing and the protein pancakes are a must-have. My friends and I call them "crack" pancakes because they are so addictive! My only complaint is that the mimosas have pulp in them, which I think is weird. But this is my absolute favorite breakfast place!

This place is amazing! I don't know the history of the building, but it looks like a barn that was redecorated into a restaurant. The decor is rustic/chic yet modern, which works perfectly. It's a great place for a date, a birthday, anniversary, or just a fun night out. Our server was very attentive; we didn't have to wait for anything. It seemed like the moment the water or wine glass was near empty, he was right there to refill it. We told him it was our first time there and we got free zucchini chips! They were a little salty, but seriously addicting. My friend and I told the server that we were sharing the chicken parmesan and the spinach tortelloni. We were pleasantly surprised when the two dishes were served in half-size portions to each of us, so we didn't even half to split our meals. The food was AWESOME!! The pasta was fresh and the sauces and toppings were absolutely perfect. Flavorful, delicious, and amazing. I would highly recommend North and I cannot wait to go back!

Hifi is fun for Sunday funday debauchery but their customer service is awful. I lost my phone one day while I was there and the whole situation was a complete nightmare. I called and asked in-person on at least three separate occasions if anyone turned in my phone. The answer was no so I bought a new phone. About a month later I was informed that my phone was in fact there. They told me to come pick it up or it would be donated. Even then, it was like pulling teeth to get it because when I tried to pick it up, I was told again that they didn't have it. This was after they called me.. Somehow it made its way across the street to bottled blonde. Through this entire process, not one person was apologetic or even seemed to care. Thanks Hifi.

I love the toasted cork! I went for my roommate's birthday and it was the perfect place for a nice dinner. It would also be cute for a date. The red wine flights are really good. They have a pretty decent selection and everyone seemed to be happy. The main reason we went to this particular wine bar was the grilled cheese sandwiches. At first glance, they don't seem the obvious choice to pair with wine, but they are fantastic! It's seriously the best, especially because you can build your own! You just have to ask about it. The truffle fries are also delicious. I love that there is live music, but it really should be quieter. It's not a club, it's a small restaurant, so I shouldn't have to shout to talk over the dinner table. Also, the service could've been a little quicker, given that it wasn't crowded at all when we were there. But all in all, I'll definitely go back.

This is the BEST nail salon I've been to! The guys are all friendly and awesome. They do amazing nails, I've never had better nail art. They are seriously artists! I get so many compliments anytime I get my nails done here. You definitely have to make an appointment at least a couple of days in advance because they get so booked up, there is no point in trying to walk in. I'll never go to another nail salon because nails by males is simply the best!
