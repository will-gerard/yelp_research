Went last night and was a bit taken back by the appearance of the lobby since they are going through a remodel but....our theater had already been remodeled and boy were we happy. 100% of the seats are comfy recliners, yes please! I can deal with the mess knowing the outcome will be total comfort! Thank you for making the changes!

Found this place on Yelp and after reading the reviews we were so excited to go! After walking in...we should've walked right back out! The staff was fine but the patrons looked at my daughter and I like we were two drug addicts trying to rob the place. The average age in there was 60+ and they stared as if they had never seen two beautiful Puerto Rican ladies before! The food was pretty good although the same toppings are not on both sides of the bar. Red bean and rice soup with sausage was really yummy but the atmosphere was so bad that we couldn't wait to get out of there! A lady actually told my daughter to move because she needed a soup bowl...have you we were in a line of people and we where already serving our soups so 5 seconds is all she had to wait with her mouth shut! Incredible! My daughter has never told me that she feels out of place before but in the parking lot she asked me to never bring her back. So sadly all the nasty stares and dirty looks worked we'll never go back so all the good ole boys/girls don't have to worry! The old and rude people win! Everyone got a kill you with kindness smile out of me and its just sad that the people in that establishment are actually okay with their behavior...for a 14 year old to vocalize it speaks extremely loud volumes to me!

Even though my date on Friday night turned out to be a jerk, I had a blast enjoying my drinks and listening to the fantastic music! The crowd was great, lots of people danced, some sat along the dance floor and sang along to the great songs and others simply socialized! I would go back again by myself because that's how great I thought this place was.   There was a $6 cover and worth the price! Great place for grown folks to hang out!

While my daughter is away on vacation I went here yesterday for some much needed sushi since she doesn't eat it. I went by myself and sat at the bar. The bar tender was really great and she even offered suggestions since I had never been there before. I had a few drinks and the crab crunch roll. I ordered it because half the pictures on yelp are of that roll. Well I'm so happy I followed the crowd! It was so flavorful and I enjoyed every bite! The only mistake I made was turning the menu over and reading the app section...how does one not order avocado egg rolls? Can you say yummmm? I hate cilantro but I dipped each bite into the cilantro dipping sauce and enjoyed the party in my mouth with each chew! Lol I will go back soon because there were a few other items on the menu that I wanted to order (I just didn't want to be that girl!)

Moved here from Florida in January and looked up Puerto Rican restaurants and I was disappointed that there were only two in all of Phoenix. When my mom came to visit (my parents were born and raised in PR) we went there for lunch and I'm so happy we did! The pernil was perfectly moist and the arroz con gandules tasted like we were sitting at my aunts house in Ponce! Thank goodness you're here!   Where are the Puerto Ricans at?!! Does anyone know where I can get details on the Puerto Rican day parade?  Thanks!!

Dear Geno's,  We were saddened by the half burnt pizza with a ton of air pockets and hardly any cheese. The picture shows our "extra" meatballs...we're still waiting for them. If you take over an hour to deliver then I expect a pizza that's pretty close to perfection. I was so happy the first time we ordered but sadly we're now beyond disappointed!  Please have someone do a quality check before you deliver food to someone's table or home!  Sincerely, No longer a Loyal Customer!

Could eat here often but I will maintain self control! You can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes!

Ordered delivery after working all day and they are further away from a few other Chinese restaurants however the others don't deliver. I ordered the Happy Family combo and I substituted pork fried rice from the steam rice. Everything is yummy and I would give 5 stars except the rices is undercooked but it still has flavor. Take out on a Friday night, heck yes! I recommend this dish!

We have tried a few other places since moving to the valley looking for comparable quality and flavor to our two favorite teppanyaki restaurants in Florida. The food, the atmosphere and the people to include the patrons made this place an instant favorite! The scallops were huge, the shrimp flavorful and my daughters chicken was awesome! The rice...what can I say about the rice beside more please! We will go back soon! Hands down one of the best meals we've had since moving here.

This place is a JOKE and they don't deserve a 10th of a star! Went for a school sports physical for my daughter. I researched THEIR website prior to going in. Their website clearly says the physical for school sports is an "affordable physical" at $25.00. It does not state anywhere that a coupon is needed or its any kind of special or discounted rate.   The moment we walked in and I told the incompetent receptionist that we were there for a sport physical she immediately said its $50.00. I looked at her and said that isn't what YOUR website says and she asked me if I printed the coupon...again their site says nothing to the effect because had it said that I would've looked for the said coupon and printed it!   Next after doing their paper work I turned it in along with the paperwork I had to print through the schools website linking to registermyathlete.com. We waited...next she tells me the packet was 'missing' documents. I stood up, pulled up the website to show her that what I printed matches exactly what I gave them but she continued to tell me that I'm wrong. Okay little girl...so I asked her if they offer sports physical paperwork or can they offer me 'what's missing'? She told me no but that she would check with the Doctor...a few minutes later the medical assistant came out to tell me the paperwork is wrong and there's nothing they could do to accommodate me. I told them that since I've showed them what was on the site could it be that they only require what was in their package online and it may be 'incomplete' to them but it satisfies the schools requirement since that is where I obtained the packet. She said "ma'am it's incomplete and if you send it in then you're sending in an incomplete packet" (thanks for being condescending).   So here's my take on the deal regardless of the packet being incomplete or not...1. Their customer service is HORRIBLE 2. Don't look for ways to say no, try and be helpful to find a solution 3. Don't lie about prices because that is a total bait and switch (another person came in and left when the receptionist told them it's $50.00) 4. Being argumentative is extremely unprofessional and to have that type of conversation out in the open for the other patients to hear is degrading and embarrassing 5. If you don't have a Dr. on staff then you should've said that to begin with because I believe that is what happened! It was easier to try and make an ass out of me instead of saying there's no one on staff that can legally complete the paperwork.   We will NEVER walk in that establishment again and as a matter of fact we will never use any urgent care brand either! If you offer a service at a certain price then honor it and have competent staff that will help solution not be part of the problem! We can afford the $50...that isn't the point! Sorry our $25 wasn't good enough!  An hour of our lives wasted...thanks!
