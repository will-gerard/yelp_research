I just went to Kelly for the first time to try out the ombre technique and to get a quick trim, and I had a great experience! The inside of the salon was very well-done and fun to look at. And Kelly did an amazing job! I was really impressed by how well he listened to what I wanted and how well he executed it. He was also fun to talk to; positive, energetic and vibrant are definitely the words that come to mind!   When Kelly had finished styling my hair, I asked him how much I owed him, and my jaw almost dropped when he told me how much it would be (in a good way)!  I'll definitely be back, Kelly. Thanks for the fun evening!

This place is still open, but the name has been changed to Juba, and it is under new ownership. Same spot though, and the food has pretty much stayed the same besides a few changes in the menu.   Anyway, I absolutely love coming here. My friend, Molly, is one of the servers, and I love her for introducing me to Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely a very interesting blend of flavors, but now I come here about once or twice a week and stuff my face. I recommend trying both the vegan combo and the pita sandwich with chicken or falafel. The coffee drinks are delicious too and since they're made with Ethiopian coffee, the taste is very unique.   If you've been hesitant about trying Ethiopian food, just get over it and go try the food at Juba. You won't be disappointed!

I've been to Cheba Hut too many times to count, and the sandwiches are always excellent, but I usually leave feeling annoyed at the slow service. My friend and I came here last night and got one 12" sandwich to share and were waiting for 25 minutes when we finally decided to ask what the deal was. It turns out that they had already made the sandwich, but they had forgotten the ticket (?), so it had been put aside without a second thought. They apologized and proceeded to make a replacement for us only to mess it up yet again. On the third try, they finally got it, but we spent 40+ minutes waiting and were not offered anything to make up for it besides the first messed up sandwich that would have been thrown away anyway. One of the employees apologized, but it didn't seem very sincere.   Anyway, great sandwiches, but I don't know if I'll return to this location after the experience that I had!

I ordered some takeout Mongolian Beef and fried rice the other night, and it was ridiculously delicious. I haven't had the easiest time finding high-quality Chinese food in the Phoenix area, but it looks like I found my new favorite place! The decor is cute and quaint too which is always a plus.

I just went to Donovan's on a date, and we had an amazing experience there! The food was delicious (although very expensive); I had the salmon and oysters, and he had a 10 oz. steak and wedge salad. The service was fantastic, and the ambiance was refined and elegant. Definitely a great place to go for a special occasion. I'll be returning for sure.

I work right upstairs, and I recently decided to try their lattes. Needless to say, it was one of the best lattes that I've had in a while. I'll be making this one of my regular spots for sure.

Just tried this little coffee shop yesterday on a whim after I caught a glimpse of it when I was driving by. The atmosphere is pretty laid back, and the decor is pretty hip. I got a latte and chocolate chip scone, and both were amazing. The latte was very well-made, and it was obvious that high-quality espresso was used. The only thing that I didn't love was the barista's demeanor; it seemed like he was in a bad mood and didn't particularly want to be there.

I purchased a HomeRun voucher for a haircut and color with Kelly. I called to schedule my appointment about a month after my purchase, and Amanda was very helpful and accommodating. When I arrived on Saturday afternoon, I was greeted by Kelly and only had to wait a few minutes before she was ready for me. She asked me specifically what I wanted and listened to my precise specifications (I'm picky about my hair, but what woman isn't?). I wanted the slightest trim possible and a brighter ombre color which I already had done, but was fading quickly. My style and color came out beautifully! I would have chosen 5 stars if it weren't for the salon itself. It's just one very small room, and it gives off a super cramped vibe. Other than that, I highly recommend Kelly!

Just got my hair cut by Autumn yesterday, and I love it! She did a great job of listening to my needs. She is also clearly very instinctive when it comes to hair; since I have curly, thick hair, it's hard to find a stylist who can adapt to that and work with it, but Autumn did a great job. I'll definitely come back!

My family and I dined here recently, and we were disappointed to say the least. I ordered the Carne Asada medium rare, and it came out extremely well done. Plus, it tasted awful. The rest of my family was equally unhappy with their dishes. The only dish that was passable was the Carnitas platter.   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else; there are plenty of great Mexican joints in the Valley.
