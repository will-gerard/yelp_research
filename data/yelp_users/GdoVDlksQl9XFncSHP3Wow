I used Paychex for my small business successfully for about 2 years. Unfortunately, after my "intro rate" expired, I found the invoice cost too high. I shopped around and found Pay-Tech, another company. Then the problems started with Paychex. I have since canceled my account with a "no issues, it's easy, you're not under contract." Then I ran my first payroll with the new service and it all seemed fine, no charge from Paychex that month. Now a good 45 days after I've canceled, I have received an invoice charge. The rep that answered the phone said they charge even when there is no payroll run through them. FINALLY, she looked at my account and saw that I had canceled. She was going to fix the problem right away. That was last week. I still have the charge on my account, the manager that was supposed to call me has NOT reached out, AND they had the nerve to add me to their sales team cold call list! Someone from Paychex called me today to ask me to start services with them. HA! Never.

Before I started going to Dr. Mansell's team, I was terrified of the dentist. I had to get a sedative before going to an appointment and even then I often canceled my appointment last minute in a panic. After just a handful of visits, I'd calmed down enough to not need sedatives and I'm no longer fearful of teeth cleanings! I've been a loyal patient for over 6 years now and my preschool aged son is a patient here as well. They're kind and gentle with him. My daughter's first visit in coming up (2 years old) and I'm confident they will take care of her, too. I highly recommend this office for all your dental needs. They're so kind and gentle.

The steamed rice was perfectly sticky, the Yishun Chicken was really spicy and the egg roll was crispy. The portion was a good size (not too much, not too little) and the service was good. They had spicy mustard, soy sauce, AND chili sauces. I'll be back, for sure. It's a good little spot tucked away at Camelback and Central.

I had eyelash extensions put on and then went back for 2 refills. The work was fine,  however when I arrived for my appointment 2 weeks ago, the studio was closed and no one was there. I called and left a message and waited a while in case they were running late (but my appointment was at 5 pm so that was unlikely). I then waited till the Labor Day weekend had passed and tried to call again. I left a voicemail on Tuesday, another on Wednesday, and a final message on Thursday. I never received a response! Still to this day, no one has called. I had another appointment on that Friday since I make them 2 at a time. I didn't bother to show up since no one had called me back. I'm guessing they've closed the business. It would have been nice to know they were closing in advance but luckily my Yelp deal that I'd purchased was kindly refunded by Yelp. Thank God the place around the corner, "Let's Lash," was able to get me in last minute on Friday and they did a wonderful job repairing and replacing lashes from the Brow Lady. I highly recommend "Let's Lash"!

I have a new pedicure place and this is it! I went in the middle of the afternoon on a Thursday and since they were fully staffed I had zero wait. I selected the middle pedicure option for $28 and was quite impressed with their attention to detail. I got a scrub, hot rock massage, paraffin wax, and all the usual buff and polishing. It was relaxing and they didn't rush anything. My polish was put on very well and I'm very satisfied with the results. I recommend this place!

I first met John at a concierge event he held at the Moss Wellness Spa over four years ago.  Before Meeting John, I didn't have a particular massage therapist I went to see, choosing to select my massages by locations (the Biltmore Spa, the spa at the Phoenician, etc) that I loved instead. All that changed with John. He is, hands down, the most wonderful massage therapist ever.   John will truly listen to your needs. I walk out of his studio feeling amazing and repaired. I saw him on a regular basis through my entire pregnancy too and I firmly believe that I was the first woman in my family to not get stretch marks because of his prenatal massages! My sister and I were pregnant at the same time and used the same products, the only difference being my prenatal massages at Space.   The Space Massage Studio is serene and makes you feel like you're in a private haven far away from the world. And since I'm a sucker for a good location, naturally I am thrilled that Space Massage Studio is not actually far away from the rest of the world, but rather located next to La Grande Orange/Postino in the beautiful Arcadia. Go see John. You absolutely will not regret it.

I am now most of the way through my second pregnancy and have been scheduling with John on a regular basis to help my body adjust. Space has a bodyCushion pillow for maternity massage and it is HEAVEN.  During my prenatal massages I can lie face down and the pillow supports my back, spine, and hips allowing my weight to be distributed evenly around a belly pocket. As all pregnant mothers know, being able to lie on your stomach while pregnant is near impossible. It is a true treat and joy to be able to lie face down while getting my amazing massage! John began using the pillow starting at about 11 weeks and we are still using it at 32+ weeks. The pillow has fit my varied sizes perfectly all along my pregnancy! The only problem is how sad I am that I don't have one of these special pillows at home.       John is highly attuned to my needs, which is the main reason why I have been a loyal client for almost 5 years now.  Whether pregnant, having soreness from working out , or just in need of relaxation after a long work week, he always adjusts his techniques and style for me.  This customization is hard to find at the resorts and "massage mills" that we have to choose from here in the Valley of the Sun.

I have been scheduling with John for over 6 years. I have referred him to friends, family, and two employers (plus their spouses.)  EVERYONE has said he is excellent and have gone to him again and again.        John has been my massage therapist through two pregnancies during which I scheduled regular massages to help my body adjust. Space has a bodyCushion pillow for maternity massage and it is HEAVEN.

I am constantly amazed at how relaxed I am after these very difficult workouts. After a few short weeks, I'm feeling so strong! Kea and Miranda are knowledgable, intuitive, and inventive.

Update: I've been going to Mira Pilates for a year. Miranda and Kirsten are amazing! I still attend several classes a week. I've lost (and so far maintained) 15+ pounds as well as gained muscle definition and strength. These workouts are ever changing so I'm never bored. I am STILL sore a few times a week which is amazing to me! Clearly, we are working different parts of our bodies as well as pushing ourselves to reach optimal levels.  I love the small class sizes and individual attention. Thank you, Miranda & Kirsten!

On and off for the past couple of years we have used Farmyard as our Community Supported Agriculture farm. They produce wonderful tasting fruits, vegetables, herbs, and bonus products, like their Honey Mustard dressing. I swear I could eat off their tomatoes alone for a month and never get bored! I highly recommend you get their eggs too which are consistently fresh and delicious.    They're timely on delivery and offer recipes in each weekly harvest basket. I loved not having to worry about what was in the food I fed my toddler or what to buy each week in the store. You're always eating in season and I barely had to grocery shop.  Besides all that wonderfulness, they do garden planning and planting as well as sell seedlings and delectable baby plants!

Oh my word. So good! The house rice is the perfect side. It's sweet, salty, and spicy! When I first had it I ordered two more sides to take home. Instantly addicted. Their Al Pastor tacos are perfection! Just the right amount of heat. While I'm not a fan of their ceiveche (too much fish, not enough shrimp), my husband loves it. I am, however, a fan of their sangria. White or red, they're both delicious.

I had gone to the Brow Lady for about 6 weeks till they abruptly closed. I called Let's Lash in a panic when it was clear the Brow Lady had closed and they offered me a very early appointment, well before business hours, to get me in the day before I left on vacation. They put me on a cancelation list and called within a few hours to offer me a later appointment, which I greatly appreciated. They were so accommodating and my technician did a beautiful job repairing and replacing my lashes. They look lovely! So full and still so soft! Thank you, Let's Lash!

I try to eat here about 2-3 times a month, at least! Their food is delicious and they offer new specials regularly. The owners staff the place and everyone makes you feel at home, which is quite amusing since they're a bunch of Aussies. They also have this hot oil that I'm kind of addicted to dipping crust into. Try it! Or maybe go for their medium heat oil, which is a great flavor, too! It's a great spot with a cute patio, what's not to love?

We found Fatty Daddy because of their (smartly placed) ICE CREAM banner on the corner of Miller & Almeria. We checked the place out last night, which coincidently, was their grand opening. Even though they're not likely to have food trucks and a DJ on a regular night, we will be back. We had the Blueberry Muffin and Thin Mint ice cream flavors. Guess what they tasted like? Yup. Right on point, guys. Really, really luxe tasting ice cream base, too. Can't wait to come back!
