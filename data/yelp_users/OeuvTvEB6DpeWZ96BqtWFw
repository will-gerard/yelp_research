I've heard nothing but good things about this hike. Definitely worth the hype!! Got there at 6:35am, only waited five minutes for the gate to the parking lot to open and there was a line of cars already. One poor guy waited since 5:30am. I think opening time varies to the time the sun rises. There's two lots, upper and lower, so if you're an early bird...drive up to the top to get a prime time parking spot.   Don't let the 1.2 mile (one way) distance fool you. Sure, the first third of the trail is pretty benign-boring typical hiking trails and a set of wooden stairs. Then you approach what looks like a wall of boulders and a rail in the middle of it. The first two intense sections has rails for you to grab on, but the last and most intense third of the hike doesn't. Even though it may be intimidating, this hike is quite doable. Just use your hands and feet and be smart about where you're stepping. It's a popular hike so there's definitely rocks that have crevices and flat rocks that almost make it seem more like a stadium/stairs workout.   Things I would suggest:  -Bring water. Preferably one you can put in a backpack or fanny pack. I think it'd be better and safer to be hands free. Water fountains and restrooms are only available at beginning of hike.   -Follow and look for the signs. This hike is well labeled with arrows for the journey up and down. Be aware of closed area signs.   -Some people brought hiking sticks. All I came across mentioned them to be more of a nuisance.   -Wear comfortable clothes and shoes with good gripping. You're literally climbing rocks!   -Don't bring a fancy schmancy camera. Saw someone almost bump it into a rock as it was around his neck. If you bring it, safer to put in a backpack of some sort.   -Don't get intimidated by the look of the hike. There were a lot of older people doing the hike and doing it quickly too! If they can, you can.   Took 50 minutes going up and 52 min going down. Take your time and look for safe footing while climbing down. I opted for the morning hike, but for sunset hikes I would bring a flashlight as going down that mountain would be dangerous in the dark. Definitely worth doing at least once and I'd totally go back again!!

This little cafe area was located right next to the Aria Guest Elevators and it was dangerously tempting EVERY SINGLE TIME.  I went there three times during my four day stay haha.  It definitely gets crowded here with the long lines and small seating area.  Definitely have someone in your party go wait for a table and have them order for you.  They have a huge variety of coffee, pastries, desserts, crepes, gelato, omelettes, salads, and sandwiches.  It could get complicated as there are three lines.  The right side is the coffee and pastry line.  The left side has two lines (but they sell the same things) and they sell coffee, crepes, and omelettes.    CARAMEL TWIST: I LOVED this coffee drink so much.  It was still strong, but not overwhelmingly sweet.  I ordered this every single time. WINNER IN MY BOOKS.  BERRY CREPE: Not overly sweet and it's yummy.  Made to order fresh!  This crepe comes with marinated berries on top and a scoop of whipped cream on the side.  Perfect to satisfy a little sweet tooth.    MUSHROOM OMELETTE: HUGE omelette with mushrooms scattered around.  It does cost like ten dollars, but at least  they make it seem like they used five eggs to make it haha.  Healthy and hearty choice.  GELATO: I only tried the creme brûlée and mango gelato.  Both were good, but I definitely could only handle so much of each.  The texture was on point, but the flavors were both on the strong side.  Creme Brûlée was sweet and mango tasted a little too artificial for me.    ALMOND CROISSANT: It was big and yummy.  Inside the croissant, there's a sweet paste.  I definitely needed help finishing it because I can only handle so much sweetness, but it was definitely good.    This place can get a little pricy, but what isn't in Vegas?  I also noticed they had another location in Bellagio too!

Located in the MGM Hotel.  I came here kind of spontaneously with my family.  We were starving in the area and some Italian sounded good to us.  Service was descent.  Wine/Alcohol options are presented on an iPad, which is unique.  Overall, it's a descent restaurant and I had a pleasurable experience.   CRISPY CALAMARI:  It met my calamari standards.  A lot of the calamari pieces came in octopus shaped pieces haha.    KOBE BEEF MEATBALLS:  Huge meatballs that we split amongst us.  Packed with flavor and it was awesome.  It came with ciabatta bread that is perfect for dipping into the pomodoro sauce.    SEAFOOD PLATTER: An appetizer dish that has a little bit of everything.  It comes with 4 oysters on a half shell, 4 prawns, half a lobster tail, and ahi tuna tartare.  I loved everything.  The tuna tartare had a kick to it, which was perfect for a spicy lover like me.  FIAMMA TRIO OF PASTA TASTING: This dish gives a tasting of three of the Chef's Favorite Pasta Dishes.  I don't think you'll be full as the picture I took shows the portion size.  I would suggest getting the actual dish instead.  Here were the pastas...  ---TRADITIONAL POTATO GNOCCHI: This lobster gnocchi was really good.  You can taste the truffle and the gnocchi is made really fresh.  I understand its popularity!  It was the only one I think worth ordering of the three. ---AGNOLOTTI: This was beef, veal, and pork ravioli.  I didn't like the flavor of this at all. I can't even tell you what bothered me, but I just didn't enjoy it. ---ORECCHIETTE: This was broccoli and spiced sausage with tomatoes and pasta.  This was just average and came out just what I expected.  RAVIOLINI:  This was my order of the night and it was great!  Usually ravioli entrees come with three or four fat raviolis and you're left hungry.  This dish came out with a bunch and I left perfectly content.  The truffle cream is amazing and the short rib ravioli is really yummy!  HOMEMADE FETTUCCINE:  This is such a filling plate.  The fettuccine is well made and the creamy basil pesto sauce is good.  The sauce is quite dominant and strong, so a head's up to those who don't like that.  Prawns were big and scattered in the dish.   BAROLO BRAISED SHORT RIB:  The flavor of the braised short rib was amazing.  To me it had a hint of asian seasoning and this is definitely a great choice for those who are craving meat.

Apparently this is a Vegas must get and is almost a mandatory with every trip (as long as you're 21.  People usually get these alcoholic slushies during the day, but they have pretty long hours.  Located in the Miracle Mile Shops next to Planet Hollywood.  In line, they check your id's first and then you're free to go to another line and order.  You can try as many flavors as you like. I ended up sharing a monster yard with two of my girl friends and it costed about $18 ish?  PEACH BELLINI:  This is what we ended up picking.  It's basically a peach slushy with rum and champagne, but I can't taste the alcohol...so it's perfect LOL!  I would totally get this again!  190 OCTANE:  This was their most popular, so we decided to try it.  OMG it is way too strong.  Had a sip of it and we all definitely could not survive a yard of it even sharing.  Tastes straight up like hard liquor haha. If you're into get buzzed/drunk in the day, this is all for you.  I'll pass on this because I'm all about that g(randma) life hahah!  SIDENOTE: People can mix flavors or add shots for $1 each to their drinks.

Looking for eating options in Vegas and I can not tell you how STOKED I was to see this pop up on my yelp feed.  I tried Joe's Stone Crab in Miami, Florida and it was probably one of my most memorable restaurant experiences.  This is their sister restaurant.  AND NOW I HAVE ONE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE US! Ok, it's not quite in LA...but it's doable.  It's slightly hard to find if you're starting from the Caesar's casino, but it's worth the long walk.  Made a reservation for lunch with my family at 11:30am (their opening time) and was seated very promptly.    Service was amazing and the waiter was helpful and hilarious.  The staff really seemed like they were all very well trained and enjoyed working there and it created an awesome atmosphere for us to enjoy.  And the food came out QUICK! I love and appreciate fast service because ain't nobody got time to be hangry.  Now on to the food: BREAD: You get an assortment of bread.  Our basket included a variety of about five different types including a traditional dinner roll, onion roll, pretzel bread, and bacon & ciabatta.  Load up on the carbs (:  HOT CHOCOLATE: It was so delicious.  None of that watered down hot chocolate nonsense found here.  Really satisfied my craving for hot chocolate and their whip cream is freshly home-whipped.  YUM!  CRAB BISQUE: The size difference jumps a lot from cup to bowl.  I love their presentation.  You're first served with a bowl with crab bits and stuff in the middle and then the server pours the bisque all over it.  I don't know if they do that for the cups, but it is a nice touch. Flavor is nothing short of what I expected.  MEDIUM STONE CRAB: Our waiter recommended us to get two orders of this (vs. a jumbo order with less claws) for our party of seven so we each could get two claws.  You still have to take off the shell of the crab, but they pre-crack it for you so it's almost like peeling a boiled egg shell.  A MUST ORDER while eating here.  JUMBO ALASKAN KING CRAB LEGS: Ugh this was amazing! Another MUST ORDER!! The meat was easy to slide out and it had a sweet scrumptious taste to it. Dip that into the mustard or butter sauce and it's pretty mindblowing. Too good!!  COLOSSAL LUMP CRAB CAKE:  This was the only dish that we ordered that I could have lived without.  It was good, but I just felt like it was a tad bit on the extra fried side to me.  ALASKAN KING CRAB ROLL:  I will totally order this again.  It's a perfect order of seafood, if you don't want to over order or go over budget haha.  They stuff the roll with fresh crab meat and it comes with a side of their homemade chips (which are pretty much perfection).  SEAFOOD CHOPPED SALAD:  This is also perfect if you're feeling full already.  This salad comes with the Alaskan Crab, Lobster, and Shrimp on top of salad with a vinaigrette.  It's so good. Like wow good. Wow.  WILD MUSHROOM MAC & CHEESE:  It is most definitely on the cheesy side and it's freaking delicious.  One side order is worth sharing because it's a lot to finish, but it's worth a try to all the cheese lovers out there.  KEY LIME PIE: THE ONLY key lime pie I've ever liked was at the Joe's in Miami. And they serve it just as good here. It's pretty freaking awesome and you're either an idiot for not ordering it (or you're too full haha). Just kidding that was mean...but it's really yummy!  I can't rave about this place enough. One of my favorite restaurants ever and you have to come and splurge a little bit here.   SIDENOTE: You can order from their dinner menu for lunch if you're interested! (:

Came here randomly just because I was in the area. Not really impressed with the food. The interior and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant is lively. I'd even say the place is pretty close to over decorating, but at least there's a lot to see. I was definitely mesmerized by their fish tank!! It had no real fish but a bunch of little ones that constantly floated around...geniusness!  Back to the food. Ordered pad see ew with chicken. The portion was pretty small and it lacked noodles. There was plenty of broccoli though. The Thai BBQ chicken was ok. Nothing too special about it. As for the garlic chicken, I don't even know if we got the right order? Our waiter said it was, but I would have renamed it crispy/deep fried chicken with some sort of sweet chili sauce? Don't know what happened there, but at least that portion size was decent.   Service was slow too. Even asking for hot water with lemon took twenty min. Ehhh just not too impressed overall.

Located inside the Planet Hollywood, I finally got to try the famous Earl of Sandwich.  Oddly enough, I live in the LA area and never got around to trying the one in Downtown Disney.  The line was long when we got here mid-afternoon, but it was moving at a decent pace.  THIS PLACE IS OPEN 24 hours, which is pretty awesome.  The service was awesome and the staff answers any of your questions in a friendly manner.    The sandwiches are cut in half already, so it's perfect for sharing two different types like I did with one of my friends. (:  Each sandwich costs about $7-8? and their sizing is ok.  You won't be overly stuffed with the portion, but I was content.  CHIPOTLE CHICKEN AVOCADO: This sandwich came with grilled chicken, bacon, cheddar, avocado, lettuce, and this bomb chipotle sauce! I loved it and would totally order this again!!  HAWAIIAN BBQ: This sandwich comes with grilled chicken, ham, swiss, pineapple, and bbq sauce.  I'm not usually a fan of hawaiian pizza or sandwiches, but this was awesome!!  I loved both the sandwiches and their flavorful tastes.  Definitely stop by if you can! (:

Super excited to try the Serendipity 3 here because it's been a few years since I've had the original in NYC.  Then, got super disappointed.  I went for the take out and not the sit down restaurant.  I'm sure the sit down restaurant presents the frozen hot chocolates a little better than the basic plastic cups we got, but overall my experience was meh.  Definitely a try once kind of thing.  Can't beat the one in New York though.  FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE:  This is what made Serendipity 3 so famous!  It definitely tasted more like a chocolate shake to me here than it did in NYC though. ):  OREO FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE:  I have a limit with how much sweetness I can take, so a few sips of this for me is enough.  If you love oreos and sweets, then this is for you.  Pretty similar to an oreo milkshake.  Ten dollar drinks here!  There are seats available right in front of the take-out window, but they are outside.  It's perfect when the weather is warm, but if it's cold...take it inside!

This restaurant is conveniently located in the Crystal Shops next to Aria.  I stayed at Aria, so we decided to try this place.  It has a pretty casual vibe and has a clean look to it.  Even though it's located in the mall, it's pretty peaceful.  This mall doesn't have as much traffic, so it's a nice setting.  Service from the staff was awesome.  Our main course did come out on the slow side though.  Food, at least, tasted awesome.  ANTIPASTA SALAD: They don't have side salads, but they have half portions.  I had this and it was awesome.  This salad has salami, provolone picante, red onion, and red wine vinaigrette.  The picante and red onion add just the perfect spicy little kick to this.  RIGATOCINI: I loved my dish and fished the whole thing!!  It's made with Piemontese Meat Sauce, Garlic, and Parmesan Reggiano.  I am a red meat sauce type of person and this nailed it for me.  Added crushed red pepper to this dish for an extra added kick.  Portion size is on perfect so that you're not overly stuff, yet satisfied.  SPAGHETTI: This dish comes with tomatoes, basil, garlic, and four big homemade meatballs.  This is definitely a safe dish.  I took a bite from my mom's dish and it came nothing short of expectation.    SIDENOTE: We had to ask for bread and butter. So if you're a carb lover, feel free to ask your waiter and they'll be glad to grab it for you. (:

Mehhh. I feel like this place is extremely overpriced for what it is.  A girl friend and I decided to try this place out.  It's located on the third floor of the Cosmo and we sat at the sushi bar.  The men behind the sushi bar were slightly awkward.  I give them efforts to try to entertain us and be social with us, but they'd interrupt our conversation at times.  :/  COSMOPOLITAN PLATTER: This was the Chef's daily sushi and sashimi for one.  There was uni in it and everything was fresh.  Presentation was also very nicely done.  My friend and I decided to share it because we weren't entirely hungry.  Even if I was eating the dish by myself I would totally still be hungry.  And it costs $85.   Overall, this restaurant seems descent.  To me, I just think you're better off going elsewhere where you pay less and still get the same quality.

It was pretty confusing.  There are separate lines for different types of meats or fries.  Stand in the line of the meat you want to order and don't be a noob like me and stand in the shortest line.  I realized there were separate lines once I looked up and noticed that there were signs haha.    VAMPIRO:  I ordered an asada vampiro. It's kind of like a tostada with melted cheese and a special salsa.  It was really good.  The crispiness of the tostada and the taste of the melted cheese is an awesome combo!!  CARNE ASADA TACOS: A safe choice.  And I wasn't disappointed. These met my standards and were comparable to the taco trucks in LA.   It's pretty cool to experience and it's pretty affordable.  As chaotic as it gets in there, they have a decently organized system.  Seating is available outside under their covered patio.  Parking can also be limited, but we got lucky during the time we went. I definitely want to come back and try their carne asada fries!!

Heard a lot of good things about this Caesar's Palace gem and decided to give it a go.  I came at 10:45am with my family on a Sunday.  We had to wait like 15-20 minutes, which was a lot less than I had expected.  There's a line further in dedicated to groups with parties 6 or more.  Our party of 7 was the third group in that line.  I felt bad for the snake like line that we bypassed.  If ever that's the case, I'd totally ask another group in line if they'd want to join groups. Whatever gets you in faster right? :D  Since we went on Dec. 28, it was holiday pricing.  It costed $47 vs. the usual $42.  Service was awesome!  My mimosa glass was never empty for too long and our waitress was really sweet.  She didn't even complain when I wanted a different drink each time.  Their hot chocolate is amazing by the way and it comes with whipped cream (:  The food was amazing!  They had a huge variety and the presentation of everything was immaculate!  Totally worth your money!  I actually enjoyed the cha siu ramen and pho.  Some buffets make asian soups too salty, but they made it alright here.  Here are a few of the things I had tried (don't judge how big of a fatty I am haha): Mussels, Crab Legs, Oysters, Shrimp Cocktail, Breakfast Burrito, Mac n Cheese, Red Velvet Pancakes, and Chicken & Waffles with Sweet Potato Fries, etc. Seafood was fresh and I loved almost everything I tried.  Dessert was awesome with the made to order crepe station and the gelato station.  I appreciate the scoops of the gelato are small, so that you can try a bunch of them haha.  I can rave on and on and I really enjoyed my experience. Definitely stop by if you're in the area (:

This place is so COOL and hip.  I feel like this is a hidden gem for sure and it definitely deserves a lot more recognition.  I came with two of my girl friends around 11pm.  They checked our id's and let us into the lounge/bar area.  Came just in the middle of a show/performance.  The bar/lounge area we went into was where most of the performance was happening at.  The stage even changes throughout the performances and is surrounded by a semi-circle of seats.  The singer is sassy with an amazing voice.  The dancers were awesome and they provided a huge range of dance from tap to breakdancing to jazz (shoutout especially to the little filipino boy dancing to Uptown Funk by Bruno Mars).  The dancers even borrowed members in the audience to join in their performance and they would dance throughout the lounge.  You'll definitely get a close and interactive experience here!!  The entire vibe was awesome.  Apparently you have to buy tickets to have a seated view, but we saw decently from standing near the bar.  They even open up the floor for the audience to dance every so often.    The other side of the stage is connected to the restaurant side.  There's a smaller stage back there with a more relaxed act during dinner.  When we walked through, there was a piano and jazzy singer performing.  This place is definitely really cool and I'll be coming out here to try the restaurant side in the near future.  They have performances usually on Friday and Saturday nights, but these change on a monthly basis.  I love how they keep this place intimate and welcoming. COME!! This place is totally worth the hype!!!

I'm from Southern California and more specifically the 626 area (aka asian food central).  Super shocked to see a pretty busy boba place in the food court at the mall in Arizona.  My curiosity decided to give it a try.  First off, their menu is SUPER overwhelming.  I'm definitely on the indecisive side when it comes to ordering anything, but they have so many different categories of "teas" such as Flirteas (fruity flavors), Naughteas (creamy flavors), etc. It's a fun concept for each drink to have a cool name, but it took me a while to decipher that menu.  I do like how they have three options for sizes of drinks.  CLUELESS: This Flirtea drink was made with guava, watermelon, lemon, strawberry, and green.  It normally comes with lychee jelly (or "gobi" as they called it here), but I switched it out for boba without any charge.  Flavor and their quality of boba was surprisingly pretty good!!  GOLDEN TEA BOBA: I think this was a make your own kind of tea option. Could not find it on their menu lol, shows how complicated it is.  Was recommended this and it totally reminds me of Lollicup's milk tea haha.   Plenty of options and they can also adjust the amount sweetness per request.  What's unique here that I don't see often is that they have options for sweeteners in your drinks (i.e.: agave, honey, etc.) A little on the pricey side because it's in a nice mall, but that's expected.
