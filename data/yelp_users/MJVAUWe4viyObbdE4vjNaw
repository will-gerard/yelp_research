My husband and I used SKM for our wedding DJ, MC, and videography.  We were thoroughly impressed with their professionalism, timeliness, and organization during the planning.  They were always one step ahead of us and made everything so easy for us.  We loved our MC, Chris.  He was very friendly and attentive to what we wanted at our reception.  He really took control, and we were worry free all night.  He kept checking in to see if I needed anything, which was very nice.  All the guests had a wonderful time at the wedding.  He had everyone on the dance floor and no one wanted to stop dancing.  The DJ, Gavin, did a great job with the music! I highly recommend both of them for your event.  We also booked our videography, David, for a great price.  We are waiting to get the video, but know it will come out great.  He stayed the whole time and even interviewed my grandparents.  I can't wait to see it.  Thank you SKM for making our night go so smoothly.  You took great care of us, and we got to just enjoy the night, our family, and friends.  Thank you!!

We enjoyed living here for 3 years; however, when we bought a house we put in our 60 day notice. We kept the apartment immaculate and were never late on payments. They wanted to do the walk through without us; however, I insisted that my father-in-law be present since it was after our move out date and I didn't trust them to give an accurate move out quote. I wanted to be proactive and called a couple days after the walk through to find out if we would be getting our deposit back or if there were any charges. They told me they couldn't help me and told me someone else dealt with move outs and would call me as soon as they returned to the office. Of course, they never called. I called again and got the same response. Assuming this was the second time I went out of my way to find out about the deposit, I assumed they would have this person call me back. Nope! I called a THIRD time, still no one could help me except this ONE person who clearly doesn't do her job. I finally had my father-in-law go to the office because at this point it was a month after our move out date. He spoke with the manager Kelly, who gave him a long story about how they take photos and it goes to the corporate office and someone would get back to us soon. Being proactive proved to not work with this company. Tonight, we received a letter titled "Urgent attention requested by Christine Hambric, the assistant manger who was supposed to return four of my requests." It states that the "balance due for the apartment has been held from collections for WELL OVER 30 days. If no contact is made, the balance will be referred to collections." My husband and I are furious. Not only did we contact them 4 times in the last month and a half, but they have never returns my calls and this is the first time we have heard from them. There is not even an explanation of the fees. The letter just states that it will go to collections if it is not paid in a week. The office will be hearing from me bright and early tomorrow. If they don't resolve this, I will contact those at the corporate office. This is no way to treat people that were always on time with payments, clean, and respectful residents. I am not a person that writes poor reviews and find that we are very easy going people. However, I cannot believe that a company could treat good residents like this. Do yourself a favor and don't live here. I'm extremely disappointed.

My husband and I have been going to this location for a couple years now. Cory has always gone above and beyond for us! Whenever I call, he tries to get us right in. He is fair, honest, and quick! We have moved and there are several other Fletcher's locations closer to our new house; however, we trust Cory to get the job done.  His customer service is amazing, and I recommend this place to everyone. We will continue to go to this location!

We are regulars here. Lana, our server is the best! She is so friendly and knows our order by heart. The owner Donnie walks around to talk to guests and always makes us feel welcome. It's our favorite breakfast place! I highly recommend it!

Cherise is a great photographer, but is terrible at communicating and running a business.  My good friend had a similar experience and I see Facebook messages that are similar, so I know it is not just me.  Cherise does not respond to emails or phone calls. It could take up to a month to get an email response, which is completely unacceptable when you are trying to plan engagement sessions or find out where your pictures are.  It started off rocky when it took 3 months to get our engagement pictures.  We wanted to use them for our Save the Date, but after several emails, phone calls, and Facebook messages, we just couldn't wait any longer and used a different picture for our Save the Dates.  Next, I asked for our guest book in April for our June wedding.  After several emails, she assured us we would have it in April.  It never came and she showed up with it on the day of our wedding.  I had no idea if I would have my guest book the night before our wedding due to her lack of commitment and communication to us.  She made every excuse in the book, i.e. My email isn't working, the photo company I use sent the wrong stuff, I never got your email, blah, blah, blah.  Because of the lack of communication and commitment, we almost fired her but were afraid we wouldn't find anyone in a couple months.  We also told her we would not pay her the remaining of our balance until we received our book and pictures in a timely manner.  Everything went smoothly at the wedding, although she did show up about 20 minutes late.  She did get our pictures on the website within a few weeks, which was shocking.  It took 9 months of communication via email to get the wedding book done because she refused to meet me and get the wedding book done in a couple hours in person.  She was supposed to order it in February.  Our one year anniversary came and went in June and we still didn't have our wedding book.  She never once emailed or called to say the book had been ordered (this was the case for our engagement pictures and our wedding pictures).  When I reached out again in June, she assured me I would get the book that Monday since she already sent it.  Well a couple Mondays went by and no book. I emailed her 3 times asking for the tracking number so I could follow up.  Of course, there wasn't one because she never mailed it.  I got no response. Did I mention she updates her Facebook every hour, but can't communicate with paying clients?  My husband and I were moving in July so I was worried we would never get our book.  I finally emailed her, although I really wanted to post on Facebook, that if I did not receive my book within the week, I would begin posting on every site I could find.  No response but the book came 4 days later, post marked the day before.  What a joke.  She still hasn't made any attempt to reach out to me.    I highly recommend not using her if you need pictures in a timely manner.  It won't happen.  I promise.  This same thing happened to my friend, and I wish I never hired her.
