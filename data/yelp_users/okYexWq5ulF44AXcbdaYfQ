Soo good! The atmosphere and the service was great. The chicken fried steak is amazing!  Puts me to sleep every time. A must try.

This is the worst Duncan Donuts I have ever been to. The girl taking my order did not know how to ring anything in and had to ask how to do everything. It took over 5 minutes to ring in two sandwiches and two coffees. I asked for cream cheese on my sandwiches and they charged us for two 8 ounce cream cheeses which came out to over 5 dollars extra. There was no more than 2 ounces smeared on each of the sandwiches. When I received our iced coffees, they were luke warm. I live within two miles of this location and by the time I got home there was no ice left. The hash browns were cold and the bagel on the sandwich was hardly toasted, very doughy, and stale. They also gave us the wrong bagels and had to remake our sandwiches. Instead of trying to make their mistakes right, they acted like we were an inconvenience. Do not go to this Duncan Donuts. There are two much better coffee shops across the street.
