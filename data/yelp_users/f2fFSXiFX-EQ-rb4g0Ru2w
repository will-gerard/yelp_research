The place is...quirky (hipster?) And it's mostly outside so remember that in the summer! Everyone we talked to was really nice and the food was great. You can tell they really put passion into the food, even if they're just making you a biscuit sandwich (the guy even pointed out how he hand-made everything on the plate).    A good place to hang when the weather is cooler but I wouldn't take a girl there on a first date.

This place is legit and Gus is great. A tad eccentric--but great. I went there because I had a Living Social coupon for a custom suit. I upgraded and spent extra but whoa. Totally worth it because I LOVE the finished product! I had no idea there were so many decisions, but I liked that.   My only (very minor) complaint is it took a little too long for my liking to actually get the suit after picking everything out and getting the measurements. Plan ahead and get there at least a few weeks early if the suit is for a special occasion.

My girlfriend and I love this place. It's clean and the staff are friendly. And of course, the food is great. Try the avocado chicken sandwich, the bread is phenomenal!

My FAVORITE Chinese place ever. It's fancier (and a little pricier) than your average take-out place, but wow. Outstanding food.

Great food, beer and atmosphere. In the summer you gotta try the peach beer (seriously) and in the winter they make a milkshake out of their stout. Don't worry, it doesn't taste like a beer. The only con is that parking can be tricky but that's true of the whole bar district.

We always have fun here. There's giant Jenga and Connect 4 and seriously, try the nachos with a margarita. My only complaint is that they don't have pina coladas, but' a minor gripe. Great place.

I'll admit, it was our fault that we didn't make a reservation. As a result, we had to sit in the bar for happy hour to avoid the 90 minute wait. The food was only ok (I had a few of the sushi rolls--Ra is better) and my girlfriend ordered dumplings and wings. The dumplings came out cold and the wings just never showed up. The bartenders weren't mean or anything, but they didn't really seem to care either. They took the wings off the bill and apologized but it still seemed disingenuous. Not really impressed.

Love it! I live in town and I still staycation here sometimes. The rooms are beautiful for a reasonable rate and the casino/restaurants are awesome. Casual/fancy dining, nightclub, nice casino, nice pool. Great place.

This place is fantastic. We went for breakfast after a night out and it was a perfect way to end the excursion. The food was awesome (I got the breakfast sandwich but everything looked so good it was hard to decide). The staff were all very friendly and they made sure our drinks stayed full. The also feature local artists (like paintings and stuff)--added a cool touch. Check it out.

I have got to say I don't know how I lived in Arizona a year without without trying this place! As a Chicago native I am quick to judge pizza because SERIOUSLY nothing compares to what I'm used to (Lou Malnatis and Giordano's). The pizza I had here had the similar buttery crispy crust that I'm used to and had a very good sweet sauce similar to Palermo's. I'm very excited and now I know where to go for pizza! It was very delicious!

Definitely a great place for the money. It was about $30 for the standard ticket and it was worth it.   The line was really long (about 2 hours) but you could get in sooner if you pay more. BUT they do make an effort to entertain you while you wait. There were monsters messing with the crowd and every 15 minutes or so a Zombie Dance Troop came out.   The haunted house is two separate attractions in one building. A traditional haunted mansion and then a sort of military quarantine zombie zone. That one is a little shorter but there's high production value throughout. Grab your friends and go. It's worth it.

EXCELLENT! We were semi-new shooters and they really took their time to teach proper technique and how to avoid common pitfalls it's not a huge place, but it doesn't have to be. Clipping the target to the post takes a little work, but you get better. All in all it was a great experience.

I swear, some people just live to complain. The place is FINE! I'm in the middle of my second lease there. It's a nice area and the people in the office have ALWAYS been professional and polite. I've never had issues with bugs, but at least half of that is because I keep the place clean. It's close to everything, too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 is because I'm cheap and I want the price to be lower. All in all a great place to live.

I like fish and I like fish tacos so I thought this would be a no brainer. For the money you really don't get much, and it was mostly fried fish in a tortilla anyway. I'd say skip it and go to a legit Mexican place for fish.

This place is fantastic. The guy who runs it purposely imports the food and Faygo from Michigan even though it costs more. Totally worth the money.   Chili dog + cheese fries + Faygo = perfect

A great place for nice weather! Decent happy hour (kinda wish the Mexican beer was included). Try the Big Crisp! Kinda like a Mexican flatbread thing. Loved it. On happy hour it'll feed 2 for $5. Service was great, love the atmosphere. Check it out.
