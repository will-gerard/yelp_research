Attended a recent event food served outdoors rather than inside . No vegetarian salad options as promised for our event. Place seemed more interested in pushing alcohol. . I would recommend if they have future events to serve indoors . Place has large eating area inside which I would recommend for future event planners

I have to the Royale three times and signed up as a member for the secret movies. I love the microcinema, selection of beverages great employees and soon Rocky Horror in an intimate environment . Hats off to Andrea and team.
