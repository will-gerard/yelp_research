Great service, great libations, great food. The fish and chips was a total winner. This bar saved a horrible evening and made it great!

A great park in comparison to the area. Parking can be an issue sometimes, particularly when there are softball events. There are a bunch of regulars who conglomerate together. Lately people are not picking up after their dogs. Also a lot of people do not leash their dogs after exiting their cars. This is a major safety hazards for their dogs and other people's dogs. Besides some etiquette issues, our dogs love this parks spaciousness.

Overpriced greasy, slimy food with below average service. Service was so so. Loud inside. My mother was looking forward to coming here and she couldn't wait to leave. Similar to Red Lobster. If you are looking for tasty seafood and a fun atmosphere, I'd say the Angry Crab is a good place

Stopped in for lunch. The food was great. We had the goat cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. Phenomenal.  The Pad Thai is one of favorites here. Tried the signature Moscow Mule. It was tasty, especially with muttled mint.  Customer service gets three stars. No need for valet parking at 1 in the afternoon on a Wednesday. Poor guy had to wait in the heat for few to no cars.

One of my favorite places in Phoenix. Tuesday is $2 can beer and they are some of the finest beers. Never been disappointed with a hot dog or a donut. And, the specials are always worth trying.

Siege came highly recommended. He is a gentleman who treats his clients with respect, is up front about pricing, and has a meticulously clean shop...three things that a lot of other tattoo shops lack.  He completed my lower arm sleeve. I love it and it gets complimented all the time. Eager to get back in his chair!

Man, oh man, what an experience. Customer service = A+ Food = A++++  The chicken pho has so much meat, so much flavor. The sweet potato roll with strawberries was accompanied by the tastiest sauce. The Bird Nest was beautifully presented and delicious. I LOVE BABY CORN.  Full bar, elegant decor, superbly clean.  We will be back. I cannot wait to try the other items on the menu!

I typically cut my own hair and rarely have a "style", but when deciding to put dreadlocks in my hair I knew I had to come to Honeycomb. Autumn did a phenomenal job on my hair. I even want to put more dreadlocks in! Shop is clean. Parking is no problem. Clients are fun. I will be back.

The onion rings are delicious. The beer menu wasn't fully represented which was a bit of a bummer. The brats were slightly overpriced.Very small crowd on a Saturday. I was hoping for more of ambiance. We will give it another shot though as it would be nice to have a successful nonchain brewery on the West side.

The staff was courteous and that's why it is getting 2 stars. Went for a show. Stuck outside for 15 min checking ids. Then have to get id verified again to get into bar causing me to miss half of the opening act (the reason I bought tickets). Not only was the venue overcrowded but you couldn't get to the bar. Couldn't even see the stage and the doors kept opening and closing which distracted me from being able to hear when I couldn't see. The bartenders had time to sit on the bar and watch the show since they couldn't serve anyone. Left without seeing the rest of the show. Thank goodness Seamus McCaffrey's was across the street. Don't know if I'll return.

Doughnuts are amazing and I'd technically give the doughnuts a 5. The place just needs some top to bottom cleaning. They nail the old fashioned doughnut.
