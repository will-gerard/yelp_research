I love D&D and have been coming here for years.  It's always my go-to place for a nice deli sandwich in the Camelback Corridor.  I frequently get the creamy herb chicken salad on croissant and it's delicious everytime.  My husband craves the D.A.M. Sandwich: Pork roast rubbed with southwestern spices, pulled and marinated in a jalape√±o and onion barbeque sauce. Topped with the Duck's famous coleslaw. Served on onion roll.  Yep, it sounds delish right?  My daughter usually gets the fruit salad or the pb & j but last time she tried the Trail Blazer Sandwich: Cream cheese, apple slices, grated carrot and trail mix on cranberry walnut bread.  Sure, it's healthy but she only ate one bite!  Maybe a bit too healthy for my 8 year old, oh well.  I tried it and it was a bit too "granola" for me too.  Oh, and you can order with ease online and skip a bit of the wait - even during a busy lunch.  We also like the choice of beverages, chips and snacks but they are a bit pricey (some specialty bottled sodas or waters are almost $3!).  For the occassional picnic though it's a delightful treat!  Also, if you have a child, don't forget to sign up on their website for the kids club - the kids get to pick an item out of the Treasure Chest on each visit.  Just another cheap little trinket to step on late at night or get lost in the couch, but the kids love it!  Don't we all love a freebie?!?  Thanks D&D!!

I love CF, such a charming place to eat with TONS of options.  This lunch visit was no exception, met a friend and ate with our two young ones in tow (7&8).  We ordered the lunch Renee's special - 1/2 sandwich, side salad AND a cup of soup.  I loved this option and it's rare, you usually pick 2.  The cup was more like a bowl, the 1/2 sandwich was still a good size (LOVED the chicken salad with almonds) and the side salad was also pretty big.    I love their bread basket, especially the wheat oat - yum!  The kids got nice sized portions of their meal - great options for the young ones, too.  LOVE the $1 ice cream scoop.  I love coming here and always want to come right back to try something else on their huge menu.

Had a gift card and a hankerin' for a unique salad, this was the place!  Chose the carmelized peach salad, ordered online and drove the 5 miles to pick it up and head home for a relaxing afternoon alone (had a movie all picked out).  Friendly staff, quick service, all bagged up and I zoomed outta there.  Got home, laid out my culinary treasure... salad, dressing, crunchy toppings, bread and butter, plate and utensils... what???  Where are my caramelized peaches?  Huh, that was my whole purpose for going...!!!  Aaargh!  Now, do I head all the way back (salad's getting wilty -- the cold part, hot and the hot part, cold)??  Or... do I call them to let them know (what's that going to really do for the moment...)??  Do I sit and resentfully eat it because I'm hungry and it's here and I can??  So much uncertainty, angst and bitter resentment.    I sat, I ate, I felt disappointed and angry.  (I tipped hella good, too!)  Later I emailed them, politely and in the "I just wanted you to be aware" way.  They sent me a coupon for a free salad, that was nice.  Still don't know how caramelized peaches taste...

Just about as good as it gets, but their prices are getting a little steep.  $2.79 for fish taco $2.99 fish especial I can understand but $1.99 for those teeny weeny street tacos so delicious to my taste buds?  We calculated and it's $.66 per bite 'cuz you only get 3 per taco.  Good thing they frequently have coupons for their email beach club and always a free meal for your birthday, what a GREAT bonus, I love that!  (PS) make the lobster burrito a permanent fixture, will ya?  And get a stupid kids meal toy for my bratty kid, she's tired of just crayons...  Just kidding...  :)

This is about the grill on the patio.  DEE-LISH-OWS (yep, that's right OWS 'cuz it's gonna hurt so good!)  I think this is possibly THE best burger I've ever had.  The meat was cooked exquisitely (I like med/well and that's rarely done right... pun intended), the bun lightly toasted to perfection, read cheddah cheese oozing down the side and the rest... a blank canvas for all of their enticingly laid out condiments and toppings.  My 8 yo daughter and I split it in half (I got the big half) and shared it on the patio while people watching.  Sadly (for me) she finished all of her half AND I had to break off a bite of mine for our doggie who was going nuts!  It's that smell of the grill on the wind that makes you crazy while you're waiting (good thing it was only about 7 min during a weekday lunch).  It was only about $7 too!  Afterward we went inside and got a couple of sugar cookies, super tasty and charmingly pretty.  I cannot wait to go back and this time I'm gettin' my own!

Awesome fresh sushi (rainbow roll, yum!).  Friendly clean atmosphere.  Delicious iced tea.  Good value for price.  Great happy hour specials.  Love the little orange boats at the end of the meal.  They need some kid options is the only thing I'd change.  YUM!!!

It's official, my whole family says 4 stars it is!  Now, in all fairness we only had ice cream here, but it was delectable & we had a fun time.    This was our first time ever here but the place looked refreshing and clean - quaint and nostalgic.  The whole experience seemed a tribute to a more simple and family oriented time in our nation's history.  I thought of how it must have been back in the "good old days" when soda fountains and ice cream parlors were a staple in America's lifestyle.  There was a wide range of choices for ice creams and sundaes, including various sizes, which I thought was a great option.  My husband wanted an authentic chocolate malt (not the custard type you seem to find everywhere now) and this hit the spot for him on his birthday.  The prices are a bit on the high side, but overall it was worth it and, let's face it, this is a splurge that most people don't do very often.  The service was really friendly and everything came out just right - thanks Mary Coyle!

Good chips and salsa is about all the positive I have to say about Manuel's on this visit.  The food quality was lacking - oversalted and grisley steak, greasy quesadilla my daughter rung out before eating and wilted lettuce strewn about the plates.  All of the prices are REALLY high for the quality of the food and it seems like there are NO more affordable options.  Even the kids menu is high ($5.50 plus extra for juice) and their emphatic NO SUBSTITUTIONS is frustrating.  The happy hour menu looks more promising but for a Family, it's a NO THANK YOU.  Sadly we won't be back to Manuel's any time soon.

I've lived right around the corner for 8 years and never noticed this place until last week, however I rarely drive that direction.  It is not very visible from the road and you can barely read the sign on the door.  My advice:  Take it up a notch Full Belly Deli, so people know you're there!    I decided to try it yesterday and I must say I'm glad I did.  Now, to be fair I've only tried one item on their large menu of subs, but it was delicious.  I tried the *small* chicken salad sandwich on a sub roll and it was just about perfect.  First off, this size is huge and filled with meat, more than enough for lunch, especially if paired with chips or a side.  The bread was fresh, the chicken was also fresh and nice chunks of shredded chicken breast, seasoned simply and perfectly.  I opted for no tomatoes, just lettuce but it was really fresh and crisp iceberg (my fave) and didn't have that weird "old" taste that subway lettuce always seems to have.  It was around $6, but I'm all about flavor and quality instead of just filing up the gas tank, so I was happy to find a good quality sub shop for that occasional treat.  I took a menu with me to look at (it is pretty huge) so I can pick out what I'll have next time and I sincerely hope it's as good as the chicken salad.  The sign did say something about new management, so maybe some of the bad reviews are from the old management?  Who knows!  I will update my review if and when I go again, maybe I'll take a pic or two.  Oh yeah, the place is really big when you walk in, lots of booths and tables, clean and shiny.  The staff was really friendly and I think the owner or manager was there and chit chatted with us, she was nice.  Thanks, I'll be back :)

We were looking for local brewers to try and this was a great find.  The place looked PACKED but we only had to wait 15min for a table and were able to grab a beer at the bar while waiting.    The prices weren't bad (around $10) and the beer was pretty good.  It was nice that the menu had suggested beer pairings with the food choices.  We also liked that you can buy cases onsite.    The place is huge and impressive, it's a nice atmosphere especially with such a huge and noisy crowd.  The service was good and the manager was making the rounds, a nice touch.  Thanks for a fun and memorable evening out!

Consistently good, quality food at an affordable price.  Easy to order and especially take out.  Great for kids and they alway offer coupons or discounts, what a way to treat loyal customers.  It's packed all the time so I know I'm not a lone fan.  I wish they had egg drop soup though...

We were on the hunt for authentic Mexican Food for a visiting relative and we found it!  I googled "hole in the wall Mexican restaurant" but despite the rough neighborhood, Los Reyes is very nice inside.  It is clean and cozy and although I'm a "clean freak" I wasn't scared to eat here at all!    We had lengua tacos, cabeza tacos, and pollo tacos - everyone thought they were delicous (especially the corn tortillas)!  We also tried the shrimp ceviche tostada appetizers for .99 which was a great value and very tasty.  My daughter had the strawberry iced drink and the cheese quesadilla and she loved them both.  Usually quesadillas are greasy or dry and this wasn't either, it was really good.  We can't wait to come back here and try some tortas, the chicken salad - which looked delicious, and we'll try to save room for some of the amazing looking fruit salad.  Oh yeah and the taco prices were outstanding -- $6 for a big plate of 3 tacos and a "salad" which was lettuce, radishes, cucumbers, grilled onion and jalapeno.  What a gem...

Son of a gun, had some fun on the bayou...  We decided to splurge a little for a special occasion, and I'm glad we did!  Pappadeaux was a really fine evening out with exceptional food, delightful surroundings, and excellent company.  I ordered the lobster despite my inexperience with how to approach it -- our waiter gave me a quick tutorial and I'm so grateful.  My husband ordered Pasta Mardi Gras and loved it - he likes it spicy!  I was glad we left the young 'un home so we could be free and easy on a date night, but we could have brought her as it was kid friendly and she would have enjoyed it.  It was a grand night on the town - we loved the ambiance and the swanky yet unpretentious feel of this place.  Their website says "Fun, Festive & Always Original" and I must agree...

Love the Gyro and come often.  They know my order and their Gyro is perfect (I go light on the onions though).  Love the soft pita bread and the side salad is good, too (zesty dressing!).  I haven't tried anything else except the shawarma which I didn't care for, oh and the baklava (not so great, kinda soggy. mines better!).  Friendly staff and the place is nice and clean.

We found this place in the Entertainment Book, any pizza 50% off (instead of the bogo which isn't very practical) and decided to stop in for lunch while in the area.  We just ordered the 18" cheese pizza and some drinks.  The place wasn't very busy on a Tuesday afternoon so the service was great.  The pizza came out quick and was nice and ooey gooey.  The cheese pizza wasn't very greasy and had a good amount of cheese.  The crust was delicious - probably the BEST crust I've tasted in Phx and, trust me, I've been on the hunt!  It was crispy and flaky on the outside while moist and chewy on the inside.  It wasn't doughy at all and even my husband and daughter ate most of it - they NEVER eat the crust!  The only downside was the tomato sauce, it was just that - tomato with no discernable flavor of garlic or herb or anything really.  This was really disappointing because the rest of the pizza was great!  It may have been ok if we had spicy or flavorful toppings to make up for it like pepperoni or sausage or veggies, I'm not sure.  My daughter loved it because she's 8 and she doesn't like basil or oregano or garlic - she loves the sauce you get in a pizza lunchable.  The only other drawback was the $5 import beer (Peroni), my husband only had one which is kind of a first!  Good thing the pizza was only $8 which made up for it.  Overall, a good spot for pizza if you get some toppings!  If they fixed the sauce, I'd make the drive to Scottsdale at least once a month!

Finally found a good Chinese restaurant in the area, yay!  It helps that they're highly affordable AND they offer their lunch specials even on the weekends.  I ordered my fave - a chicken lo mein lunch special for just over $6.  It comes (as many do) with eggroll, cup of soup, crab puffs, sweet & sour sauce and fried rice.  The noodles were perfect (hard to find the kind I like - firmer), the eggroll was really good (also hard to find, some have too much ginger, or they add cinnamon or there is too much pork flavor, blah blah blah), and they have a unique, yet yummy sweet & sour sauce.  About the Lo Mein:  flavors were bold and savory, there was plenty of chicken, the veggies were fresh.  The rice was also really good but the eggdrop soup was the best I've ever tasted.  I ordered it over the phone and ran to pick it up, it was ready in about 8 minutes and they were really professional, fast and friendly.  The food was hot and the crispies were crispy (hate soggy puffs/rolls).  I will definitely be back!

They are always accomodating for special requests or substitutions.  The service is fast and friendly and my family likes the quick in and out.  They sent us $5 off for a birthday gift and I think that is a nice touch to show they appreciate their customers.  I LOVE the kid friendly menu that has more options than most places and organic is a plus in our book!  My daughter adores the free ice cream and she would pick Jason's deli almost every time if given the choice.  My husband loves the pastrami there and I love the flexibility.

Fast food can be delicious, at least at Chik-Fil-A!  I met some moms here for a little play date and lunch, I hate McD's and this is another option - a better, cleaner, more nutritious and delicious option.  UPS: My daughter hates nuggets, any nuggets, anywhere.  She LOVED these nuggets and the fruit cup, she finished it all!    The play area is smaller but it's nicer and cleaner and has less kids running around (at least on this afternoon).  They have delicious and fresh salad options which also come with their scrumptious chicken (you can get grilled too).  Love the dressings!  Friendly and helpful staff.  DOWNS: A little pricey for those fresh salad options (almost $8)  Sucky kids toys (comic book?)

I'm not a meat person but they put almost NO meat on this bread sandwich.  Why even bother when Subway is right down the street?

I'm only rating this review based on the broaster chicken at this location.  This chicken is awesomely delicious, crispy outside and juicy inside - not greasy.  We are addicted to this and buy this expensive treat far too often.  We have had the pizza in the past and didn't care for it.  We also had an italian salad and didn't like it.  Their sides with the chicken aren't too great, either (fries, etc.).  The wings are great because they're broasted but the hot sauce isn't good and sometimes tastes "off" so we don't eat it.  Bottom line:  get the broasted chicken and nothing else, you will love it!

I came here because of the positive reviews here on Yelp, and Yelp, you let me down... I forgive you though, because generally you're spot on and I love you!  That said, I only tried O.G. once and it was only the chicken kebab sandwich, but it wasn't good or pretty or tasty.  The whole sandwich was pretty bland and the onions and tomatoes were huge chunks I could barely get my mouth around (they were bigger than the chicken pieces).  It was so wet that the pita turned slimy and soggy in the 1-2 minutes it took me to take it outside to unwrap and eat.  It also dripped everywhere. :(  I couldn't eat more than about half of it (some of the chicken, a couple of tomatoes and the edges of the pita).  I wasn't that sad, but I was still hungry.  Don't worry, Chicago Gyros, you're still my #1 spot for Greek!

We were hungry in Scottsdale, pulled out the entertainment book and there she was - Silver Mine Subs - Eureka!  I know, I know - another sub shop right?  Nope, this one is a bit different IMHO.  First off, we like the different sizes.  For us a 6" is too much for my daughter but the kids is too small, 5" is just right.  A 6" leaves me hungry and a footlong is too much so the 8" is just right for me.  The options were good, so we chose the "Caribou" - Tky Brst, Dbl Provolone, Avocado, Lett, Tom, Sprouts, Mayo.  The bread was fresh and chewy, the veggies were fresh, the price was right (especially with our BOGO from the book).    The staff were all very friendly and professional, the service was fast and the place was very clean.  We took ours to go but next time we're hanging out just to look at the scenery ;).

I really, truly wanted to love this place!  I found it online for my husband's birthday breakfast.  He has been searching EVERYWHERE for a correctly cooked over easy egg - outside of MY kitchen of course ;)   It seemed charming, interesting and the menu was promising.    The food was just so-so, all of it.  Mostly because it was lukewarm and had a few no-no's.  The benedict was good except for the squishy English muffins that didn't seem toasted.  The hash browns were mushy and cold on both plates.  The strawberry waffle was also cold and had one brown strawberry.  My husband ordered over easy eggs which had raw egg white.  However the eggs were replaced at his request with a better set.  The coffee was really good and the service was as well.  I think the locals love this place, we barely beat the rush...  The food came out quickly, which may have been the problem.  It wasn't more than 5 minutes since we had ordered, and clearly wasn't enough time to cook it fresh or even keep it hot.    The worst part about all of it was that with some really easy and quick remedies this could have been an amazing breakfast, worth the price we paid.  A toasted muffin, a few more seconds on the heat, a berry tossed into the trash - voila, Saturday morning magic instead of Saturday morning tragic...  My husband is STILL searching for a restaurant that can cook an egg.... over easy.

Still on the hunt for THE best pizza in Phoenix, but Stevie's is a hit!  We loved the thin crust, not doughy but still foldable NY Style. Sauce was tasty, hint of garlic -- nice! Cheese was plentiful, not too greasy. Pepperoni was spicy but not too much.  We bought the HUGE pizza and ate it all on a Sunday afternoon (VERY rare for the 3 of us).  Even my daughter ate two slices and loved it (usually she loves the ones my husband and I don't and vice versa).  My husband is also a fan and so am I.  He even gave us a free soda while we sat and waited (he may have suspected it was our first time).  Thanks to Stevie's, we'll be back!

I don't expect much from diners, but GEEZ give me a break!  We went on a Saturday morning and yes it was busy but ALL 3 meals were COLD as ice and my husbands eggs weren't over easy, they were over raw.  I expect over easy eggs to be runny and maybe some white portions not perfect but they were clear!  I almost lost it while watching him try to eat around it.  My daughter's pancakes were cold, my french toast was cold and none of it could even melt the butter a little bit.  When they ask if everything's ok they are literally walking past and you just know if you asked to heat it up who knows when you might get it back and how it would be then.  It was a big disappointment because really, how hard is it to get warm french toast and pancakes at an IHOP?  So so sad...

LOVE the BBQ flavor of the meats here, all are good.  We didn't like the sides much though (personal taste?).  It would be nice to have a few kid options and maybe some smaller choices for when you don't want a HUGE meal but a smaller one.  Other than that, Oh Yeah!  What a gem hidden away - get some more advertising!

Yume = Yummy  (sorry but I had to...)   We enjoyed a dinner here with relatives who know sushi.  We all loved trying the unique creations as well as the regular "go-to" rolls.  We wore a big wasabi smile all night - great dinner and good times.  The d√©cor was reminiscent of a 50's diner, complete with big booths, neon lights and a really stunning saltwater fish tank that provided much entertainment and conversation.  The place was fresh and clean and the service was fast and friendly.    We ate inside but had to check out the patio area when we left.  It was surrounded by charming lighted trees and provided some great pics.  It wasn't busy but it was a Tuesday night and I think it should be packed because the sushi was really beautiful and tasty!  We ordered several rolls and some nigiri - everything was fresh.  Iced tea was fresh, too.  There was plenty of parking (again Tues night?) and the value was quite reasonable.  I would definitely come back and I'm sure I will.

Delish!  Coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, pancakes, French toast, eggs & bacon - check, check & check!  All were amazing and fresh.  Prices were really reasonable especially for the freshness and quality.  It was worth the drive from N. Phx - will go again as soon as we can, so many things I'm dying to try!

BEST SALAD I'VE EVER TASTED, I'm addicted and drive across town just to get their Shrimp Caesar Salad.  This is one of the best flavor combinations ever to grace my palate so I don't mind paying the money for it (something about that cilantro dressing, the slightly spicy shrimp and those crispy noodles).  This is all I ever order (frequently take out which is easy), but I love that my daughter can have their kid's pizza for an affordable price and she just adores getting the raw ball of dough to play with while waiting.  The decor is kinda kitchy but I don't notice too much because my nose is buried in the SALAD!  They always ask me if I want my iced tea packed up for the road, it's the little things....  Love it love it love it!

What a refreshing way to spend a sizzling day!  This was the PERFECT answer for what to do when it's so hot out that you can't think straight!  It was affordable, easy, relaxing, and loads of fun.  We love the fact you can bring a cooler full of drinks and snacks to keep you hydrated and energized.  It's a big relief that there are so many alert and friendly life guards throughout the facility, even with kids that can swim well.  The highlights for me are the wade in pool entrance complete with beach style chairs under a shade canopy, the picnic area with plenty of seating, and of course the lazy river that is so delightfully fun and refreshing.  It's nice to have the wifi as well.  The facilities are bright and clean and the staff is perpetually friendly and helpful.  We will certainly be visiting this place throughout the summer, and you should too!

Swanky and upscale without the pretention and snob factor.  All around us we saw beautiful d√©cor and delicious food being enjoyed by happy people.  The service was really exceptional and the menu was intriguing and interesting - so many things I'd love to try!  We ordered the guacamole with the crunchy corn and enjoyed it's unique and flavorful flair.  The complimentary chips and salsa was really tasty, too.  The entrees we tried were the seafood enchiladas and the battered shrimp tacos and carnitas street tacos.  Everything was delicious and we devoured every bite.  My 9 year old daughter ordered the chicken quesadilla and said it was the best ever.  We hope to be coming back sometime soon to try some more amazing cuisine.

Great little gem just down the street - have a feeling we will be regulars.  The banh mi grilled pork sandwich was amazing.  The bread was slightly crispy outside, soft and chewy inside.  The meat was delicious and tender and the veggies were fresh and made it.  We also tried the spring rolls and lotus salad - quite delightful!  The boba tea and smoothie was also really a treat.  Clean, friendly, fast, affordable - what more could you ask for?  Oh, maybe a kids size selection?...

In all fairness, I've only ever had the Cod Tacos but they were so good I came back 3 days in a row for more!    The fish was crispy and perfectly sized to fill (not spill) the taco.  I'm pretty picky about tortillas but these had a nice texture (not the dry rubbery ones that come from that fish taco chain) and the cabbage / sauce was fresh and tasty.  I couldn't stop thinking about these tacos and had to go again... and again.    The price was right, about 7 bucks for the two tacos and 2 sides - rice (which I liked and typically don't) and the beans (which I really liked).    For me, the portion was perfect for lunch, just enough that I could barely poke it all into my smallish appetite but not so much that I had more than a bite or two left.  I called in my order all 3 times and it was ready in like 8 minutes, fresh and packaged really conveniently for a quick lunch in the car (parked, of course).  The d√©cor is really modern, sleek and inviting - the patio looks amazing and I'd love to try sometime when I have more time.  Parking was ample in back, there is a large parking lot and that's where you enter.
