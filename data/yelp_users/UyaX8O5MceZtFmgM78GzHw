Be prepared for long lines!  They do a good job of moving you through quickly though.  I love this place.  Love the way they cook the dogs in front of you, love the lingonberry juice, don't like the seating area but what do you expect for a hot dog joint? :)  Great place to take the kids.

I've given this place 5 chances.  5!!!  And they have done a crappy job on my nail fill every single time!!  How hard is it?  I even speak up and tell them but it doesn't help.  They use too much product so the nail looks  super thick, don't even try to match other tip color if your missing a nail, and I always have small bumps dried in my polish.  They also play Vietnamese movies only...  I thought the tv was there to entertain the customers.   Guess not.  So, if you want a nice fill- go elsewhere.

Very cool unique little restaurant.  Great place to take kids, especially boys. :) they may have a tough time finishing their meal though.  Mine were very distracted by the planes.

The tortilla is perfect, the potato is cooked correctly and they use the right cheese.  Amazing breakfast burritos.  Then top it off with the off the hook green sauce and you have yourself an addiction.  Love this place .

I walked in in a Friday night at 7 pm.  Place was DEAD.  That's always concerning.  But I went ahead and ordered take out for the family anyway.  I should if just turned and walked out.  Very expensive and food wasn't very good.  I'm amazed how this place is still open.  I would probably give them another shot by bringing the family in for a sit down meal but the aura of the place gives me the willies.  Decor is terrible and with no none else in there, it's depressing.

Quick response.  Professional and courteous staff.  They responded very fast when we had an emergency.  Good solid company.

I am a big fan of this place.  Ive driven by many times and have looked forward to attending an event there.  We were finally given the chance for a friend's surprise birthday party.  I assisted with the party setup and had the chance to speak with Noah's staff.  They were very helpful and they have a beautiful facility.

Great place to worship Him.  Amazing teaching, bible based, small church in a mega church (if that's possible).  :) but that's how it feels.  Our family is commuted to serving here.

This place used to be really good.  Now, it's like they really don't give a crap.  Message to Danny's: you are in the business of washing cars, NOT selling crap like birthday cards and floor mats.  Focus on getting the vehicles clean (inside AND out) in a timely matter and you will rule.  Why no one has been able to do this is beyond me. See pic.

"hair on mushroom soup" I suggest you skip this dish.  And they didn't been apologize.  4 tables in the place and they still forgot about us.  This place sucks

It's rare to find a roofing company that actually returns my calls. Monarch roofing kept us in the loop during the entire process and did a great job.  We highly recommend that you give David a call.  He will take of you.

This place has great soup for lunch!! Good service too.  My husband and I spent a beautiful afternoon on the patio.  Downtown Chandler is getting better and better by the year.

Fantastic!  Food and service were wonderful!!  We ended up sitting at the bar because there was an hour wait.  Very glad we stayed.

This is my go to place.  They do an amazing job and are super fast.  They also communicate well and speak /understand English well.  Most nail places I've been too are unable to understand basic English yet still nod their heads and say they understand.  These guys get it and do a good job.

I gave this place a shot because my usual place was closed for a week.  I wish I would of waited.  The nail tech was very nice and she tried but she took twice as long and it cost me $15 more than I usually pay. $34 is way to much for a fill.  Especially since it was a sub par fill.  I do like the design of the salon and the counter idea.
