This was by far the best meal I had in Scottsdale. The service was excellent and the food was delicious. Our table had salads, the scallop appetizer, trout, shrimp and the swordfish special. And of course, the green chile mac & cheese and the asparagus sides. There was not a complaint among us -- and we're a picky group. Everything was cooked to perfection and the flavors were amazing together. We had notning bad to say about this restaurant!   The server recommended terrific wines and was knowledgeable and attentive.   I will absolutely go back to this restaurant when I'm in town again. It was a great experience.

This is *only* 4 stars because it was my first time staying here but it won't be my last! Beautiful place, great rooms, amazing service, delicious food, relaxing spa and a ton of cool activities.   I stayed in a mountain casita and it was enormous. Definitely enough room for a family of 4 (if you don't sit in your room all day long). Huge tv (with a dvd player), nice, deep tub, very comfy bed and a nice sitting area. The mini-bar had lots of local choices and was well appointed with a martini shaker, glasses and olives. Very nice touch!   I was here for a conference and the meeting room facilities were also very nice and well appointed. They seemed to have an adequate a/v set up (at least the conference attendees didn't notice any glitches) and the mid-day room reconfigurations went smoothly. The food they served was really good -- one of the best buffets I've ever had.   I will absolutely be back for a personal trip.

It was my first time here and I loved this restaurant. Beautiful grounds and we had a wonderful meal at sunset.   The food was very good, with the truffle mac & cheese being a fave. The wine list is extensive with lots of unique choices. The staff was attentive and made good suggestions.   Bonus: One person in our crew needed gluten free options and the kitchen gave her a ton of choices. So folks with food allergies, you can really eat here too!

This place is so loud you can't hear yourself think. It's definitely a place to people watch, since you can't really communicate with anyone at your table.   The best part of my meal was the salad, even though it was mostly iceberg lettuce. It was crisp and fresh and the dressing was nice and light. The sushi did not seem very fresh but I guess that's what you get in a land-locked state. Each roll we tried was just a little bit off -- either the spice wasn't right or the mix of flavors just didn't work. We also had coconut shrimp which was very coconutty. Not bad just not very subtle.   I think their strong suit is likely their drinks. My friend had a mango & something martini which looked like a slushie in a maritni glass. She enjoyed it, the rest of us enjoyed our wine.   Wouldn't go back for the food, but maybe for a drink with someone I didn't want to talk to.

This is what a spa experience should always be like! The setting is wonderfully serene and the attendants are quite knowledgeable. I had an espresso mud treatment that was so awesome, my skin was really soft afterward and I felt almost euphoric. My friends had facials and they claimed not only relaxation but a thorough assessment from their technician.   They use high quality products and they have a steam room, soaking tub and showers in the spa and a finely appointed lounge area. It was a wonderful experience.   I loved it but the prices are exorbitant so don't come here on a budget. I'll be back someday.

Yum. Garbanzo appetizer is a must. The lamb was amazing and cooked perfectly. The fish w/ quinoa -- wow.   We ordered the leek appetizer based on it being named one of the top dishes in the country. Honestly, we didn't understand the appeal. Unique, yes and the leeks themselves were flavorful but the cheese and bread crumbs on top seemed incongrous with the other flavors. Glad we tried it but not a fave.  Nice wine list and the staff was friendly and helpful.
