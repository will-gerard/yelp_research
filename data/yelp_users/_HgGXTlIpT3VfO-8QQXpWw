Definitely not NY pizza...I'm disappointed they actually call themselves  NYPD.   U want real NY pizza go to momma Mia or venezias.

I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years now and it's become my favorite restaurant. This location, however, is my least favorite. I went in for dinner one night and had Michelle C as a server and it just seemed like she was in a bad mood and didn't want to be there that night. I'll take my business elsewhere thank you.

Definitely NY style pizza.  This place comes the closest, then venezias.  Not sure why it's so hard to duplicate NY pizza but these guys surely achieved it.  Minus 1 star for the slowest service.

My review is for the server Kate,  not the restaurant itself.  The food was great, but Kate failed to explain the pricing for a specific menu item.  The price on the menu was not the price I paid, it was double.  Not sure I'd return after that.

Brought my dog and a date here for dinner.  Love the outdoor patio area with all the dog lovers.  JESSICA was our server and was very sweet and always smiling.  She's actually the best server ive had in a while.  Up there with Naomii at Cooperstown and Andrew? at Angry Crab Phx.

Went for a haircut cuz I happened to be in the area.  Ended up having to grow my hair back out to get the style I asked for.  I won't go into too much detail, all I can say is, read the reviews, this place sucks to high heaven.  You're better off going to another local barber. I'll NEVER return to this place, the cut was NOT what I asked for, and they rush you in/out.  Save your $.

I came around 3pm for happy hour, got the bacon burger, the shredded beef, n the fries.  Burger was good, not the best but good.  Shredded beef was good but I couldnt finish the bread. Kinda dry but not bad at all.  Fries were covered with cheese,  mmmm.  Sexy lookin bartenders, friendly n cute.  Free arcade style video games, fun.  Casual atmosphere, nothing fancy.  Music good.  Cool place to grab a drink n some apps.  Bye Felicia!

Excellent movie themed decor, cool bartender PJ, the servers bring your food and know you by name, attractive staff, good parking,  good location.  5 star worthy in my book!  Had the twice baked hot wings, a lunch special pizza with pepperoni,  bacon, n ham, AND a half chicken cheese hoagie w chips.  Excellent prices, very worth it.  I wish I could say more about this place,  but it was my first time.  A mellow virgin.  Def will return, soon.
