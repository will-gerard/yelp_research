My experience is far too long to write on here. I would never recommend anyone give their time, money or service to this place. I have been lied to and taken advantage of on more than one occasion. Of I could return my truck and cut all ties, I would.  My finance advisor had me come back and sign my contract four times! He said he found me a better interest rate through a different financial institution etc. What he really did was take certain things out of my contract and I don't even know what happened with that money!

I've been coming here for 18 years! This place is so consistent. I love how it tastes the same (sooo good!) as it did 18 years ago!

Maintenance here is ridiculous. My bathroom sink would leak like crazy after the warm water ran for a minute. They told me it was fixed, I'd come home turn the water on and by the time I was done taking my shoes off my bathroom was flooded. My kitchen sink started to leak so they replaced it and now I have next to no water pressure.   The appearance of this place is getting worse and worse. One example, our pool has been green all summer.   Recently, I signed another lease and my rent for a one bedroom went up over $100 a month. That is disgusting to treat a tenant that way. As if they already aren't making a ton of money already, I got charged $50 because my rent wasn't paid on the 1st that was a holiday! I log on to my account on the 2nd to pay, thinking there wouldn't be a problem since the 1st was a holiday. Nope! $50! No grace period, not willing to work with me. I've never been late, ever! And it was the day after a holiday! I don't understand how they can be so unwilling to see the facts and help me out.   I would never recommend this place to anyone.

I had a few hiccups here but nothing you shouldn't expect dealing with an apartment complex.

I was extremely anxious and I was pleasantly surprised with Andrea. She was very professional and made me feel very comfortable. I'll definitely be back.

Tried this place for the first time tonight and it was amazing! Everything was flavorful and the staff was really helpful! I will definitely go again. And again.

I came here for the first time today and this is by far the best cup of coffee I've ever had. Dunkin and Starbucks will never taste the same to me! Overall it was a great experience. So fresh, great baristas working and a super cute shop.
