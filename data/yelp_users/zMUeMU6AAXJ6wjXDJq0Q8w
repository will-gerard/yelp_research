I've been taking my two 20 lbs dogs to Wiggles and Wags for nearly a year now. We've tried many boarding spots in the Phoenix area, including the big chain places and other local establishments but each time the dogs would come home stressed out, sick or a combination of the two.   A friend recommended Wiggles and Wags in Tempe as a spot to try as a "last resort" and I am so thankful she did. Honestly this should be the first place anyone considers for boarding.   I have never seen a staff that is so great with dogs and people too! They have gotten to know my family and really make a point to make the extra effort to make the pets feel comfortable while there--- and it shows! My dogs come home happy and healthy from boarding each time and are always treated well.   The rates are affordable and the facility is great - really clean and all of the dogs look so happy when they are there! I highly recommend this facility for your boarding or doggy daycare needs. We are Wiggles and Wags fans for life!

Do not use this service. You will be thankful you didn't. If I could give less than one star I would. I attempted to use Brothers Gonzalez Landscaping after they left a card on my doorstep. The first time they came to my property and actually did the work they said they would do. I was home and was able to pay them after the work was completed. I had asled about being put on a monthly maintenance schedule and they agreed. A month rolled around and they had not showed up. When I called them to ask if they were coming they told me they forgot. (Great, I thought). They scheduled for the following day. That day I couldn't end up being at the house all day and so wasn't home at time of service. When I returned to the house they had already been here and did minimal work. They barely trimmed my front hedges and didn't even go into the backyard, as the did the first time. Worst part is, I had left a check for the service under the door mat. Well, they had no problem taking the check and cashing it immediately. I called to ask why the full service wasn't given and they promised they would come make it right. I've called 3 days in a row now and today I was hung up on by the person at the phone number listed on this yelp business page. When I called back I got a voicemail. I suppose I was too trusting they would do the work as they did the first time. I'm currently looking for a new landscaper that will bill me for payment. Awfully disappointing experience.

I've been working with Lindsey from Fit Happy Girl  for about 5 months now and love it and her!! When we started out, I hadn't stepped foot in a gym in over a year. We started with just one session a week and I'm now working out with Lindsey 3-times a week and love the results I'm seeing and how great I feel! Lindsey's positive, encouraging spirit helps me every step along the way. Lindsey always has a smile on her face and an amazing attitude that keeps me motivated during my workouts. Thanks to working out with Lindsey, I've become more confident in the gym and stronger, too. Plus,  I'm seeing great, lasting results - losing body fat and gaining lean muscle.    Lindsey and Fit Happy Girl have changed my life for the better and I'm sure she could help you too!
