My husband and I recently were married at the Webster Center at the Desert Botanical Garden in Feb 2014 and we had a wonderful experience!  Amber Hahn, the coordinator, was extremely helpful and responsive to our needs. She also acted as our point person for the ceremony as far as timing and even helped out when our minister accidentally forgot some important parts and we had to do it all over again! (Which just added to the charm!)  As part of our process, we did a site visit, a walk through, a rehearsal and of course, the main event! We all felt very comfortable with how the day would go and appreciated all of the practice rounds and visits!  The ceremony space at the Webster Center is breathtaking! The few photos we have received completely capture the Sonoran Desert beauty and we are just so pleased with the million options we had!  The staff, including the beverage manager, Marianne Donnan, and her team were wonderful and easy to work with! Two thumbs up!  We also absolutely loved that we could have our ceremony, cocktail hour, plus dinner and dancing in one general area! It made the evening flow so smoothly! Also, the space was extremely accommodating for our guests who required accommodations or wheelchairs. There is nearby parking, bathrooms on one level and ramps as needed.   The Chihuly exhibit just added to the magic of the night and I just can't say it enough! This place was amazing and we could not be happier!   Thank you Amber, Marianne and all the staff and crew at the Desert Botanical Garden!

Had dinner here last night and it was delicious!! Super cute, intimate old house restaurant centrally located on 16th, just south of Highland. Best part....(and if you've read my other reviews this will be a shocker!)....it's BYOB!! There is a $9 corkage fee without a limit on the number of bottles you bring in to enjoy. Love it!!   So, BF and I started with the daily soup...white tuscan bean...delicious!! They were super accommodating for his GF food allergy and we nearly licked the bowl clean! We then split the tomato & mozzarella salad which had fantastic, fresh mozzarella. It was awesome!   For dinner, we shared the pork tenderloin and it was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were incredible! Obviously very rich (I'm guessing cream cheese and sour cream), but they were ridiculous!   I had been eyeing the cheese plate as many other groups were enjoying it, so we decided to take one to go! It's a bit pricey ($18), but the 4 cheeses they selected were so good (Humboldt Fog Goat with ash, Parm Reg, an awesome creamy, brie like cheese and another yummy one with golden raisins) plus it was accompanied by great, buttery toast points with dried cranberries, apricots and fresh pears, apples and strawberries. It was soo good!   One thing that we didn't try, but would like to, is they are known for their tarts. They have a selection of about 5 each day, with one daily special (yesterday being smores...what!?!) and they look amazing!   Such a great little place!

I have been going to Ethan at E's Urban Hair forever and I heart him!   He always gives me a great cut and color for a reasonable price, plus keeps my hair in style! I have pretty short hair and I highly recommend him for those of us without long locks as he is awesome with short do's! He also takes appointments super early (like 7am), stays late most nights, plus usually works Mondays too!   The salon recently moved from it's original location down the way between the bakery and Goodwill. It is a super eclectic space and is now a full service salon with manicures/pedicures, waxing, facials...you name it! They also take walk ins, but for Ethan, I recommend an appointment.   Love it!!

Love Love Love a Hava Java! Their coffee is so good and it is always such a treat to enjoy a latte with my favorite girls! By far my favorite coffee in AZ!  The staff is super friendly and it is a great neighborhood atmosphere! Also, love the punch cards especially when I get a free one!!  Can't say enough good things about Hava!

After living in AZ for most of my life, I have finally been to the Wrigley Mansion! Who knew it would take this long and now I can't wait to go back!   As a surprise, the BF made a dinner reservation here on Friday and it was great! We had a table outside and really enjoyed the amazing view and the atmosphere of this awesome Phoenix gem!   Overall, the food was pretty good (loved the truffle fries!) and the service was good, although a bit slow, but none of that mattered because it is just too cool of a place! Most of all, you gotta love a night that starts with being handed a glass of champagne and told to go roam at your leisure around this gorgeous property with so much cool history!   Really worth checking out and also a great location for large and small parties as they have multiple rooms that can accommodate groups! Can't wait to go back!

So, I'll keep this short and sweet, since reviewing Postino's is like writing a review of your best friend - there is never enough space and there is no doubt I will forget something!   But in general, I always have a great time at Postino's! Love, luv, luhv the brushetta with my favs right now being fig and prosciutto, brie with apples, the white bean and pesto and salami! You also can't go wrong with their salads and sandwiches! Plus, I heart that the GF BF can make his own brushetta experience by ordering the platter off the appetizers list! It's basically a deconstructed brushetta platter with all the fixins!!   The by the glass wines are usually very good, although they mostly will be ones you have never heard of! Never a bad thing to try something new! Their by the bottle selection rocks and I so appreciate their few nods to Washington wines like DeLille etc!   Finally, what makes me love Postino's aside from my wonderful company, are the servers! I have to show some love for Dominic, who is simply wonderful and always takes such good care of us (thanks for picking out all the bright green olives for us yesterday!) He is GF too so he feels the plight of all of you trying to avoid that evil flour! Also a treat to see Troy as well!   Finally, don't miss the $5 glasses before 5 pm on all days, including Sat and Sunday! It may make me slow on Monday morning, but at least I'm still smiling from the memories!! Thanks Posties!!

Visited Cyclo on Friday night with a party of 7 and mmmmmmmm......mmmmmmmmm....it was delish!! Justine was the perfect host and of course, love the fact that it is BYOB without a corkage fee!  We turned our evening over to sweet Justine and she did not disappoint! Everything was wonderful....spare ribs, spring rolls (love the grilled pork), green beans and the yummy egg crepe! Really good!  For our entrees, we shared a number of outstanding dishes! Plus the food just coming and coming! It was a great way to try so many different options! To top off our feast, we ended with amazing Vietnamese coffee (seriously wish she would open a coffee shop - it's that good!) and a Thai Ice Tea! Refreshing, fabulous and I seriously could have had 4 more!!  Because it is not the largest location, be prepared to wait, but it is definitely worth it! Can't wait to make the hike down to C-town again to get my pho on!!

Finally...good Italian food in Phoenix! And, I'm a little hesitant to write about how great this place is as it is already super busy, but it is awesome!   It is super small , which can result in quite a wait, especially on the weekends, but well worth it! (They are also awesome for takeout as well). It is also currently BYOB with no corkage fee!   From the minute you meet Pasquale and the rest of the guys there, you know you have found something great! Definitely go with their recommendations as I have loved them all and I have also really enjoyed the Red Clam sauce, which is next to impossible to find here in AZ that is worth eating! The cannoli's...amazing!   Also, they are accommodating for people with gluten allergies. They will either adjust one of their meat/pork entrees to work for you or you can ask about bringing in your own, unopened bag of GF pasta. I do have to caution you that when it is super busy, they aren't always able to accommodate when you bring your own pasta, so just be sure you are good with the back up plan!   Can't wait to go again, but don't foget to bring cash as they don't take credit/debit cards and they do close at 8:30pm!!

After doing a little shopping at the OTFM on Saturday, I headed over here to try it out based on the good reviews from Yelp! What a pleasant surprise!   I'm not a huge pancake person, so I decided to try the Greek egg scramble with egg whites and the BF had the yogurt with fruit, since he had already downed a GF cupcake and cookie from the GF bakery. The scramble was delicious, perfectly seasoned and I ate every last bite of it! Also, the wheat toast was fantastic!!   I also had a chai tea which was different, but really good! So many chai teas are overly seasoned with ginger and this one you could really taste the black tea! The BF had a latte as well and he loved it!!   The only thing that wasn't awesome was the seating process. There was a definite awkward process of getting seated...not really knowing do you seat yourself, do they seat you. A more defined seating process would make this a solid 4.5 stars!!!

Located upstairs within the Steven Paul salon is a waxing genius! Kolton Fox does an amazing job on brows for the bargain price of $15!   One word of caution...he is EXTREMELY meticulous, which obviously works out in your favor in the end, so don't expect a 3 minute brow wax! We are talking 30-45 minutes each time!   Love him!!!

I'll keep this short and sweet, but Shields is fantastic and will now be my go to biz when I need an electrician!  Very professional, reasonably priced ($75 to hang a chandelier), on time and in and out as quick as can be!  Thanks for being so trustworthy!

This place is a solid 4 and 1/2 stars with a great fresh, local menu and fantastic wine list!   My last meal here was excellent with a very knowledgeable and honest server who provided a great dining experience.   Some of the highlights were the asparagus, the beet salad and the short ribs! Oh my gosh did I love all 3 and I have been craving hominy ever since!! Plus, they even had a favorite bottle of wine that my BF and I covet that can't even be bought at the vineyard anymore (I'm not telling as I know they have one other bottle left and I don't want anyone to drink it!!)   Decor is a little Scottsdale circa 1987, but you can tell that this is a great kept secret in Scottsdale! I will definitely be back!!

What??? This place is fantastic!!   Like many others, I hesitate to write about it as it is such a little gem in the middle of strip mall hell and sometimes it is hard to get a reservation! But, Razz's is so special that I felt he was due a review!   I have and will only eat at the Chef's Table as Razz is hilarious!! He is total entertainment and I just delight in everything he says and creates!   So how this works...you sit down, tell him what you like, don't like, food allergies etc and what you want to drink...the rest is in his hands! He is totally accommodating for food allergies (which the GF BF loves!) and he has some great unusual wines at fair prices!   And then the gluttony begins....course after course comes out of AMAZING food! Everything is superb and I am always painfully stuffed when I leave as I just want to see what he makes next! We have never had the same thing twice, which is something Razz prides himself in, and we really enjoy the whole experience! Finally, when you decide to throw in the towel (my record is 7 courses!), a fantastic desert assortment comes out just to finish off a fantastic meal! One thing to remember - don't eat the bread until he tells you it is okay!   Razz does close down for the summer (leaves in May, returns in October) so be sure to try it before he is gone and always check their website as they often have great coupons available.  He also stays open late too!  Love it!!!!

To me, there are few finer patios in all of Phoenix than the one at Chelsea's!! Great ambiance, good jams and most importantly, yummy food!   So I end up at Chelsea's at least once every two weeks, so I'll highlight some of my favs...   Wine list - yes, their selections are bit pricey, but there are some hard to find bottles on that menu that are simply wonderful!! The Argyle Brut Rose that is only available at Sportsmans etc for half the year is always on the list and it does not disappoint! Bella Glos, Seghesio, Summerland and the Sinister's Hand - what could be better! I'm getting thirsty just thinking about it!   For food - love the shrimp ceviche, although I wish they would ix nay the olives as they are a weird addition, but I just eat around them! Love all the tacos, the prime rib is delish and the rotisserie chicken - TDF! Don't forget your sides too at only $3 each!! How can you skip the french fries (extra crispy, extra ketchup!), mac and cheese and usually the farmer's market veggies?? Fabulous (said like Oprah!)  My most recent discovery yesterday was off the brunch menu - the chilaquiles!! WOW!! It is described as Mexican lasagna, but it is so freaking good and so much more that that! I'm usually part of the clean half your plate club, but this dish I showed no mercy! Amazing!   Andddd, my review of Chelsea's would not be complete without a full nod to my favorite - the brussel sprout salad (add chicken!)! Simple, light, delightful! It really is a gem!   My only knocks are that they don't take reservations for groups of less than 6 or 8 (I can never remember) and it's annoying for the GF BF that their corn tortillas have flour in them (no Chilaquilies for him!). Other than that, it's a dream that I hope to see again very soon!   Don't forget to grab a salty, chewy cookie on the way out!!

This place is fantastic! Everything I have had is simply delicious and I literally wake up some mornings craving their clams, black cod, Sun roll and salmon! The GF BF and I really can't get enough Yasu that just writing this makes me want to go there for dinner tonight!  Don't forget to try the whole list I already mentioned plus the eggplant (either way it is prepared), live scallop if they have it, the jidori skewers, kumomoto oysters and the black snapper!   Seriously amazing!

Wow!! Went to Binkley's last night for the Valentine's Day 6 course tasting menu and all I can say is WOW! Thank god we have this restaurant in the Valley as it is really outstanding!   The GF BF and I sat outside on the patio, which was delightful for the early seating especially because it is small and cozy with a great fireplace. There were 2 tastings for each course offered so we decided to try everything, including the wine pairings. I have to say that I could really get used to not ever having to decide what I'm going to eat...but anyway....the shear gluttony began! Course after course of heaven paired with a perfect wine really was amazing!   The chef is also extremely generous offering a large number of amuses prior to the meal even beginning! Such creative items like a mini sloppy joe, amazing steak tartare, shrimp ceviche and a mango bomb made to look like a fried egg. Truly delightful!   Some highlights from the actual 6 courses were the marlin tartare, crispy seared foie gras (divine!!), black truffle sunchoke soup (lots and lots of black truffles), seared diver scallops that melted in your mouth, ribeye cap with a red wine risotto, roasted brussel sprouts and a perfect cipollini onion, my favorite a 2 day old burrata with a poached pear and a very cool intermezzo "shot" that was distinctly a good 'ol PB&J with a little chocolate! Everything was wonderful and we really enjoyed our service as well!  We took a look at a regular menu and will definitely be back! Kevin is a fantastic chef and we can't wait to try his brilliance again!  P.S. They are super accomodating for food allergies!

I really wanted to like Uncorked as it is close to where I live and work and it is very cute! However, with the exception of the owner Ali, the service is not good.   I have visited Uncorked 2 times in less than a month and had less than acceptable service by the staff. The last time, the waitress was down right rude to my guest and although the waitress comped our wine, it didn't make up for her terrible attitude.   I think if the staff turned over, that this could be a great little local spot, but until then, I'm not heading back.

So, just to provide an update one month later...  After writing my review of Uncorked, I was promptly contacted by Ali, the owner of the wine bar. As a good business owner would do, she politely inquired about what had happened and indicated that she wanted to rectify the situation so that I would return.  Within a week, I responded with a lengthy description of my two prior visits. Since then....crickets....nada...no response indicating that my concerns have unfortunately fallen on deaf ears.  As I said in my original review, I really wanted to like this little neighborhood wine bar, but clearly they just don't get the importance of customer service and word of mouth. Bummer....

Really good and cheap Mexican food fast! Love their enchiladas, green chile burritos and tamales....all for under $5 each! Their salsa is hot and their tortillas are homemade and so yummy!  And although I love the Mohave location, this one is much closer to my neighborhood and it is much easier to park here. Plus it is larger which makes the "survival of the fittest" vibe a little less pronounced!  Yummy!

Celsius is a solid neighborhood sushi bar. I have been here quite a few times and really enjoy sitting at the sushi bar, especially when Joe (the owner) is there! He does a great job of expanding my sushi horizons by offering samples of new and fresh items to taste!   As Larry said, the service can be a bit iffy at times, but at the bar I always have a good experience. One other great thing, since my BF is gluten free, Joe has been working on creating great GF sauces, like Ponzu, Eel Sauce etc, to accommodate those who can't have any wheat. They also have Tamari, in addition to regular soy sauce for GF guests.   They have regular and reverse happy hour every day, plus an all day happy hour on Saturday which you can't beat. Their drink selection is great and there is always a special on wines and/or cocktails. Enjoy!

What a disservice I have done to not have reviewed Hana previously! This is my hands down favorite sushi spot...no question!  First, the staff is so incredibly nice! This is a family run operation (Laurie, her brother, her mom, her dad and so on) whom are so welcoming and friendly! They always remember my GF BF and I and make amazing accommodations for his wheat allergy! Plus, it is a BYOB with no corkage which always makes everything better!  Next, the fish is by far the freshest in the valley! It absolutely just melts in your mouth and the portion sizes are perfect! If you sit at a table, you also have your sushi served in a boat...who doesn't love a boat?!? Also, the rice is a very good stickiness and always cooked to perfection!  My GF BF and I have also ventured off the sushi menu and tried their shabu shabu (swish swish) Sunday night special and the most amazing Asian dish I have ever had called Gyu Don Nabe (it's on the kitchen specials board). Simply amazing!!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  It's not a huge place so be prepared to wait sometimes, but it is completely worth it!! Can't wait to get my fix again!

Not like Roka Akor needs another 5 star review, but it really is that good!   Went there on Friday with the GF BF and sat at the chef bar. This is a great spot to watch all the amazing creations come out of the kitchen whether it be the sushi chefs or the grill!   Our server was fantastic and very attentive and the manager was wonderful (great wine recommendations!)! Both had great suggestions and they were more than happy to accommodate our gluten free requests (FYI - they have tamari in house). We started with the edamame, butterfish (amazing!) and the scallops (heaven!) These are not large portions and we were starving, but everything was delicious!   We then moved to sushi were the BF found a common love for special salts (pink, house made curry, black volcanic, green team and finally truffle) with the manager! From that point on, we were hooked on this place! We had the spicy scallop roll and the salmon/avocado roll. Both were amazing, especially the salmon which was sensational.   From there, we took a pause before the final round! As we were watching the sushi chef, he created an off-the menu steak tartare nigiri style with a cracked quail egg...the manager insisted we try it and it was fantastic! Such a delight!  After some more time to digest, we decided to go with the Yuzu Marinated Black Cod....this was a first for me and OMG! I am a huge fan! Buttery, melt in your mouth amazing fish! We also ordered some rice and veggies on the side, but the chef came over and advised us to a sampler instead, especially so there was no gluten in the veggies. Out comes a buffet of yummy items off the grill...zucchini's with lemon, tempura veggies (not GF though), and my oh my the asparagus! This was all just fantastic!   We couldn't get out without a little GF cake and finally, finally, we rolled outta there after 3 and half hours of shear delight! We will be back (probably sooner than they may want us too!) as it was spectacular!

This has been my go to car wash since it opened well over 15 years and boy has it gone down hill.   Today I arrived at 12:20pm with only one other car waiting in the ticket writing/vacuum area. There was one guy vacuuming the other car and 4 others standing there. Each, at some point in my ridiculous 5+minute wait for my ticket to be written, came over to offer me an oil change, a wind shield replacement, fuel etc but not one could write a ticket. Finally the magic ticket writer appeared and wrote my ticket.   My car went through the car wash in sub 3 minutes as it was out before I was done paying and it was evident how 'fabulous' of a job they did on the vacuuming. Clearly nothing had been done but I was just over this whole experience.  Waiting outside in this lovely 105+ heat, I noticed they have turned their misters off as well. Great customer experience and satisfaction...not! The inside was barely wiped down but I didn't want to spend one more minute here. Also, while I was inside the cashier was very sweet and when I commented that they needed more ticket writers, she agreed. Not sure how Danny's expects to increase sales if you can't even get a ticket written! Better yet, how about they cross train one of the 4 guys standing around doing nothing to write a ticket in a timely manner.   As a final note, when I pulled away I went left, not right as most people do and saw 5 more Danny's employees hanging out under a tree. Guess I know where all everyone went. Later Danny's!

Ummmm....not my favorite!! Have heard a lot of great things about Maizie's, but had a late lunch there over the weekend and was kind of underwhelmed.  We found the whole seating process very disorienting and confusing, but once we were settled, we found the menu to be too big and overwhelming! I am a girl who loves an option, but this is like a Cheesecake Factory effect where I begin to assume they serve everything, yet specialize in nothing. Plus, there are a million people running around the restaurant, but it didn't seem like anyone was really providing good service to their tables. Actually, that was because nearly every server was eating in plain sight of the diners, which just bugs, especially when my ice tea is empty.   My BF and I both ordered salads....both were okay although there were definitely some serious lettuce rejects in both. The chili was quite good though, which was a nice surprise!  Looks like they have a good happy hour and a committed local Cen Pho crowd, which is always a pleasure to see, but I just didn't quite get it.  Sorry Maizie's, not thinking I'll be back anytime soon.

So not like after 63 reveiws and still a 5 star rating is my review necessary as I think we all get the point....BUT it is just so good I have to put in my 2 cents!  The flavors, the textures, the sweet girls behind the counter...everything is fantastic! I love love love the salted butter carmel and the basil lime sorbet is wonderful!  Seriously...can't get enough of this place!!

Tried Cafe Bink last night after an afternoon vino stop at Brix! Having been to Binkley's, I was really curious what the difference was, but this is a little gem too!!   My sis and I weren't starving starving so we decided to share a bunch of small plates. We started with the fries...my oh my that truffle ketchup!! Sinful and ahhhmmaazziinnggg!!! The frites were also cooked to crispy perfection with a superb, moist (hate that word) inside! Mmmmm....We also shared a salad that was good, but nothing to yelp about!   Round 2- At the waiters suggestion, we ordered the pork belly on spaghetti squash with brussel sprouts, house made gnocchi and a pulled to order mozzarella! All 3 of these were out of this world, especially the mozzarella and the pork belly! Sinfully delish!!!!   All in all, the patio is a great spot and they have an interesting wine list. I also asked about gluten free accommodations and they said they will certainly do what they can to accommodate food allergies! The GF BF will be quite pleased to go back there with me!! Can't wait!

Soo, last night was my 2nd dining experience at NoCa and it definitely blew out my expectations!!   On Sundays, they do a "simple supper" where the menu is limited to only a few choices of entrees...everything else is set! The best part is that the price is set at a bargain $35 for all 3 courses and they offer a simple cocktail (last night was a cherry lime martini) and a simple red and white wine each for $5! (The rest of the wine list is available though!)   As always, the service was impeccable and I really enjoyed the Bartender! He was super helpful and even clued us in on one additional special starter they were offering of a sea urchin panna cotta with lobster for $14. Now the BF and I love sushi, but aren't huge uni fans. OMG am I glad we tried it! The BF described it as the ocean with a touch of cream! Pure heaven!   Our second course arrived as a simple salad of beets. It was fantastic and we both nearly licked our plates clean! For the entree course, the BF had the flat iron steak, while I had the halibut. Both were simple, delicious and wonderful! There was nothing left of either and specifically, the celery roon and parsnip puree was amazing!   Next came the standard cotton candy course which is always fun and then dessert! Who doesn't like an ice cream sundae with all the toppings of your choice!?!? The BF literally ate all the hot fudge while I indulged in the roasted pine nuts, strawberry sauce, cookie crumble and cherries! So delicious!!   Really, this food is great and I love the idea of the simple Sunday menu! It changes every week, which is posted on their website, and it is a great, less expensive way to try some of the best food in AZ! Can't wait for Sunday now!!!

So, went back to ATS last weekend with the GF BF and really really enjoyed everything we had! So glad they added the additional seating out front so it isn't such a "Survival of the Fittest" situation and the horchata....seriously! I could have drank the entire jug she poured it from!  We also had the carne asada tacos, a vampiro each and yes, a piece of heaven sent corn! We will definitely be back!!

The BF and I stopped in for a late lunch on Saturday as this has been on our long list of new places to try. We were immediately impressed by the eclectic decor with a great mix of contemporary, Southwest and classic styles. I love the lighted "brick" wall and mirrors tilted just right so you can always see what's going on behind you!   We started with the tableside guac and it was delish! We ate every last bite and definitely enjoyed the presentation aspect. Then we shared the corn (to die for) on the cob with a clever mix of spicy mayo and cotija cheese for the right mix of salty, heat and cream.   We finished up by sharing the pork shoulder tacos. These were fantastic and love that all their tortillas (including the chips) are 100% corn and therefore GF! I could have eaten 10 of them as they were that good!   My only knock is that it does seem pretty expensive. Throw in one margarita and one Tecate and the total for both of us with tip was $60! Yikes!!   All in all, a great addition to So Sco that we will definitely visit again!

So, I just wanted to give a big THANK YOU to my fellow Yelpers for telling me about the OTFM! As a result of your reviews, I tried it out on Saturday with the BF and am now addicted! Forget Trader's and Whole Paycheck...this is where I'm buying my fruits and veggies from now on!   Just as it was described, this is the perfect size for shopping for local and/or organic food that is absolutely to die for! Who knew you could actually get tomatoes in AZ that taste like the ones I had in the summer in Michigan! Simply fantastic! Don't forget the basil and strawberries too!  I didn't get a chance to try the often raved about Phoenician bread as I didn't want to make the GF BF jealous, but it looked amazing and it will be on my shopping list this week!   Thank you again as this is a great find!

Stopped by Brix yesterday to check it out after it came recommended from a wine friend who lives up north. She had described it to me as the way to do a wine bar right and she was spot on!!  Bryan was an extremely gracious host and my sis and I love love loved our bottle of D2! (Gotta support my WA wine obsession!) The energy was great and it was quite busy for a Sat afternoon! Also, the wine selection is awesome - I wish it were my own personal with a few more WA wines of course! And, it's at retail pricing with no corkage if you open a bottle, which is fantastic!!  When the GF BF gets back, we will definitely head north with our own snacks to hang out at Brix again! Simply delightful!

What a treat to have Press within walking distance of my house!! After walking by a few times and from the Yelp reviews, I convinced the BF that we should skip Sbucks for a day and give it a try!   I am so glad we did as it is as great as described by the other Yelpers! All the staff is extremely helpful, nice and overall, super pleasant! The chai tea (both hot and iced) is probably the best I have had in P-town! The BF really likes their regular lattes as well, but he would tell you to ask for it extra hot if you like hot lattes! (Cool shapes with the milk too!)  They carry a great assortment of wines, including the bottle I just drank at Razz's a couple weeks ago, which is really hard to find. They also do a lot of events (BBQ's, dog events etc) that seem like fun and I can tell there is already a 'local' group that hangs out there on the weekend mornings.   Another bonus is they are super dog friendly! Bernie will definitely enjoy some time there on the patio (at least when it cools off!)   Can't wait for my next latte!!

I was recently married at the Desert Botanical Gardens and at the suggestion of my caterer (Santa Barbara Catering....love them too!), I reached out to Tamara with Petal Pushers.   Tamara was extermely responsive and easy to work with. By the time I got to the flower decisions, I was in serious decision fatigue. From an easy questionairre, Tamara put together a quote with sample photos of what my flowers would look like. The quote was about where I expected it to be for my requests and so I put down the deposit.   2 weeks before the wedding, I did drive out to their location in Avondale just to make sure that everything was set, especially since we had one long table with nearly 100 people and I wanted to make sure the centerpieces were going to be just right. The location was cute as can be and there are sweet puppies there too, which always makes everything better! Tamara had all of my information and we quickly covered the plan!  I could not have been more pleased on my wedding day to see the amazing arrangements and bouquets they had created! Everything was perfect and  they hit all of the marks we had discussed, even down to petite dark pink roses for the flower girls and the amazing desert inspired bouquets for myself and my bridesmaids. The tables were stunning and worked perfectly with our family style meal and super long table!  Thank you so much to the Petal Pushers team! You have a very happy customer!

I have used My Pet Nannie multiple times and they are the best!   Professional, trustworthy and very easy to work with! I even have used them with very short notice without a problem and my pup always has a great time with them! Also, they leave you a little report card describing what happened on their visits, which is great!  Highly, highly recommend My Pet Nannie!!

So, the BF saw in the AZ Wine newsletter that LaFond/Santa Barbara Wine Company was doing a paired dinner at Crudo last night! Since we have visited both, we could not pass this up, especially when we realized that this cozy little gem in the heart of So Sco has the chefs from Atlas and the old Fine's Cellar (still dreaming of truffle popcorn...yum!)!! Jackpot!!   Since I go to Kolton Fox (who I adore!), I was familiar with the location and restaurant, but it is part of the Steven Paul Salon. The patio is lovely with cute tables under the trees and right on the corner so you can watch the world pass by! We were greeted by Dina who was a great host last night and the fun began with a lovely glass of Prosecco!   For dinner, we had the pleasure of sitting with Joanie from the winery and Jeff from Valley of the Sun Distributors and we had the best time! First course was a crudo of amazing net caught Salmon from Oregon with kumquats, Meyer lemon, micro-argula and truffles! Amazing!! Melts in your mouth!!   Second course was a ridiculous albino beet risotto (who knew there were albino beets) that I could have eaten 10 more servings of as it was that good! Perfect! Perfect!   Third course was pork heaven on polenta! OMG! So good and I'm very proud of myself as it included not just a pork loin, but also a little trotter, jowel and cocks comb! The polenta and tomato drizzle was so good as well! Simply delightful!   The intermezzo was a yummy cardamom and banana sorbet made special for Crudo by the former pastry chef from Cowboy Ciao! Her desserts are fantastic and this little palette cleanser did not disappoint!   Final course, which I loved that it was not a true desert since I am a savory girl, was the perfect cheese course of a little goat cheese, a little pecorino and some heavenly andouille sausage from Dina's grandmother! The perfect ending!   All in all, this is a fantastic little spot with the nicest people! The chefs source all of their veggies and herbs locally from Mayas! They are also extremely accommodating for our friends with a gluten allergy and on their regular menu, all but the gnocchi are GF!   We talked to the chef about hosting a dinner there and they are more than accommodating! Can't wait until we get to go back! Thank you!!!

Have been back 2 more times since my first review and Crudo has never missed a beat! Love, luhv, luv hanging out on the patio with Cullen, Bubba and Dina under the stars with great wine and even better company!  Last two times I have had the 3 course crudo deal and have found shear genius in all of the plates! So much food with fantastic, clever combinations and please do not miss the fish crudos, especially those that come in fresh from the Japanese fish market!   Really a gem in So Sco that should not be missed! See you again soon!

Thank you my fellow Yelpers! The GF BF and I were craving some Vietnamese food last Friday night after the gym (yes, we are wild and crazy!) and found this new little gem based on your reviews!! You certainly steered us to a yummy spot!   I was immediately pleased when we stepped in the door as the decor is very pretty with lots of cool, solid woods and very interesting pieces of art! We were quickly seated in the room adjacent to the bar and found a fun, joyous atmosphere surrounding us!   We were starving so we immediately order the traditional spring rolls and some hot tea. They were fantastic! Superb peanut sauce and I am huge fan when they actually grill the pork, which Tottie's most certainly does! We wolfed these down and I seriously could have eaten 100 more!   Next, we had the Papaya Salad with sticky rice and chicken and the Beef Pho. The sticky rice was amazing and the flavors and freshness of the papaya salad and chicken were fantastic! The beef pho was also very good, but since I just had Pho with Oxtail stock from Monsoon in Seattle, I'm a little picky right now! Still, very very good!   At this point, we were stuffed, but I know we'll be back again this week to try a few more items! Love that they have a variety of Asian cuisines to satisfy any craving (including my fav - sizzling rice soup!)! Now if I can just get Tottie to add a delish egg crepe and pork buns...I would never leave and she would earn that last coveted star!!  P.S. Very very accommodating and understanding with food allergies, especially gluten free!

Yayyy! A fun, cool place to hang out in the Desert Ridge area that is not actually at Desert Ridge! Thank you Tagan and Frank for making this happen!!   Amaro is located next to Cocomo Joe's on Tatum and Dynamite in a former sushi restaurant (I think it was Sushi 10 if I'm not mistaken!). The place is HUGE with a sweet bar, great couches, lots of flat screens and a tons of room to hang out! In the dining area, there are lots of cozy booths, along with regular tables, seats at the kitchen bar and a cool round table in the middle that would be fun for a group! The boys did a great job decorating with reds, grays and some cool art work from a local artist (plus a fascinating plant in the corner!)   Amaro opened last Thursday and a friend and I dined there on Saturday, just their 3rd night! I was fully prepared for some new restaurant jitters, but everything was great! We sat in the bar and had a glass of Prosecco to congratulate Tagan and Frank on their new adventure! Then we split the Pancetta/Blue Cheese salad, which was light, tasty with extra yummy crispy pancetta and perfect for a splitz-kies! We followed this little delight with a Prosciutto pizza that was delish! I'm still enjoying the leftovers! Oh! And we enjoyed the Liocco red throughout the rest of our meal including the creme brulee - which was fantastic and ginormous!   Since my dinner pal and I had already had it before and we were looking to be adventurous this first time, we did not have the Kantak Chop which is that same amazing, crazy fantastic, I dream about you Stetson Chopped from Cowboy Ciao (Oh yeah! Lots of friendly Ciao and Kaz faces will surround you at this place!) Sweet Jesus - thank you for putting it 6 miles away vs the 20+ I was having to drive to So Sco for this salad from heaven! It is that good! I also can't wait to try the buccatini (my fav pasta) and the filet sounds amazing!!  Plus they have a great happy hour daily from 4-7pm!  So excited for Amaro's arrival and best wishes to Tagan and Frank on their newest culinary adventure! Welcome to the neighborhood! Hope you don't get tired of me hanging out all the time!

The wonderful amazing Janet! What a life saver you are and my oh my! You are so talented!  I am a little Jcrew obsessed so I of course purchased my wedding dress at the bridal salon in NYC! When I asked where in AZ they recommended I have my dress altered, they told me to come back to Manhattan to one of their folks...uuhhh no...so my quest for an alterations person began!  Thanks to the amazing reviews for Janet on Yelp, she was my first stop! Her location is just a smidge north on 68th Pl of Thomas...turn right at the Streets of NY pizza place and then she is located in the House of Brides on the west side of the street. She has the perfect little spot downstairs with a changing room and a 3 way mirror when you are ready.  Since I had not seen my dress on except the one time, I was nervous to check it out, especially with all of my undergarments and with shoes. Janet was very helpful and immediately put me at ease. We talked about what I wanted to see and I learned all about french bustles and american bustles and all sorts of things I never knew about. Needless to say, she gave me excellent direction!  I had one additional fitting after the holidays to make sure everything was in the right place and then it was showtime! She held my dress for me and allowed me to pick it up on the day of my wedding!   I could not have been happier with the results! The bustle was perfection, my little wrist ribbon saved the dress from getting dirty at the Desert Botanical Garden and this baby fit like a glove! She is a true professional and I was thoroughly pleased with my dream dress!

Visited here a few weeks ago with 3 friends after hearing the hype about a new, cool hipster place for fab cocktails. Plus I am a fan of whatever Bernie does, so I figured it had to be cool.   Without repeating what everyone else has said, this place leaves a little something to be desired. The hokey, NYC-wanna-be-like process of getting into the place is kind of lame and was an immediate turnoff to me. I completely understand wanting to limit the number of people in this cute little space, but come on! Gimmicks just bug!  As mentioned by others, the drink list is very limited and you cannot order anything but what is on the list. The G&T takes well over 20 minutes to "brew" and when the bill came, which did include the 20% grat, we spent $100 for 4 drinks...seriously, no drink is that good...it is still gin and tonic at it's core.  My least favorite thing about my experience is the rotten, grease trap smell that invades this spot. It is completely and utterly nauseating making it impossible to stay for more than one cocktail, if you had the bankroll to afford another.  I hope after reading some of these reviews, they make a few changes and lighten it up a bit as who needs to be so dang serious about cocktails!

Stephanie is true professional and very easy to work with! I was recently married and she was great!  We did a trial run about 3 weeks before to get an idea of what would work and to try a few things out! She was very open to my requests, but also challenged me to push my limits some since I don't typically wear a ton of makeup everyday!   On the big day, she arrived exactly on time and was ready to go! She is one woman traveling show that is very efficient and knows what she is doing!  My only thing that I would change, now knowing my hair took only a short bit, is I would have done my makeup after my hair. Kicking the day off with makeup at 8am was tough and I did need a little blending and touch up in the afternoon due to the length of the day, but that was on me and my scheduling!  Her rates are very competitive ($65 I think for the trial and $150 for the day of, with the bridesmaid estimate of $65) and she brings everything to your home or desired location!  She is a doll! Couldn't be happier with her!
