I'm not a local and was just visiting Phoenix on business. This location was laid out oddly and there were two lines when I began to wait. I should have known better as most Starbucks locations have a single line with two cashiers punching them out during peak hours. Anyhow, as I approached the register my group of second liners was getting the stink eye from what looked like the "real" line. Being polite I asked the group, "so, I am guessing our line is incorrect," and one guy responded. "Yea man, this area here has always been where the line forms....," he blurted out. My response was a shoulder shrug as I placed my order. I had been waiting in line for five minutes at this point, the same as him, so I figured I was entitled to place my order. In my opinion the staff should have directed us instead of letting us pile into a second line avoiding the ugly stares and head shaking. The cashier failed to give me a receipt and seemed annoyed when I asked for it. Traveling on business means I am expensing my $5 coffee today. After a few minutes she had to get a manager to reprint, so I told her to forget it.

I ordered a bacon, egg, with cheese burrito to go. The turnaround time was about 2 minutes. When the guy handed me the bag I thought there was an error cause it was so heavy. Turns out that $9 burrito is a beast. I wouldn't be surprised if they told me it took a half dozen eggs to make it. The tortilla was fresh, the eggs were fluffy, but the bacon was just a tiny bit too hard. It was loaded with Pico de Gallo which I wasn't expecting, but it did add a nice dimension to the flavor. $9 is a bit steep even for airport prices, but my appetite is more than satisfied.

I was a little concerned at first ad it seemed much too swanky for me. There was a huge lunch line, so this place was obviously fantastic. Everything has fancy catchy names and they don't serve regular soda. They offer their own versions made with real sugar instead of high fructose stuff. I am OK with regular industry soda, but it tasted like a mix between pepsi and RC cola. Worked great for me. Their frys were super fancy too with sprinkling of green stuff, some kind of herb. They were perfect and came out as an appetizer. This is perfect for me as I usually eat most of my fries before my burger. The hamburgers seemed small, but totally satisfied my appetite. The flavor was AMAZING, and worth the $35 price for 2.

Excellent flavor with reasonable prices considering it's in the middle of an airport. I think I was a little much for the cashier as she seemed to shy away at my excitement at their bacon flavor offerings. I have never seen bacon flavored ice cream before, but I am sure it's pigtacular. "Is it good?" I asked the staff and she just looked at me nervously shaking her head. I chickened out and went for normal human flavors. If anyone has the bacon, please post a review.

Let me first start off by defending against some of the reviews of my fellow Yelpers. If you are looking for a bargain, this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for a speedy turnaround, again, not the place for you. This joint cooks real hamburgers from scratch. Good luck finding something this fresh throughout any airport. I eat here any chance I get. When you order your burger you are told that it will take about 10 minutes to cook. Again, nothing is pre-cooked. That hamburger patty he is putting on the grill is the real deal. A full meal including fries and a drink will average you $15 and it's worth every cent. Yes, it's greasy and heavy, but it's a "real" burger. I feel I'm a very manly dude and can appreciate those characteristics in my hamburger. Seating kinda sucks, but perhaps it's so passers by can gawk at that look of pure satisfaction on my face as I lick my fingers clean. Delish.  If you don't like costly slow burgers, there a McDonald's around the corner with factory burgers.
