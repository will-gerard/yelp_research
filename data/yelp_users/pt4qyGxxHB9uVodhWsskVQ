Let me tell you about Frank's Pizza on Indian School. I placed my order today 3/18/2012 online at 3:15 for pick up. When I arrived 40 minutes later I was informed that their system was down so they never got the order. Got my money but not my order. I figured ok, things happen, I reordered in person this time and requested they deliver, and was told I would have to wait another 40 minutes. 60 minutes later I called and was placed on hold for 5 minutes. I hung up, called back and was told the driver had the order. 20 minutes later (i live 5 min away), I go to Frank's pizza and demand my money back. I witnessed the delivery guy return and noted he was not carrying my order. Hmmm. So on top of really poor service I had been lied to as well. While I was waiting there (both times)  i watched a really incompetent staff handling the food with bare hands, the place seems also to be in the midst of remodeling (no longer carrying the ice cream). Poor service. Lied to, incompetent staff, mishandling of the food. I'm calling Mamma Mia's from now on, a little longer wait but worth the wait without the aggravation.

Want your clothing over starched(even when you request no starch) to the point that your elbows rip out of your sleeves? This is the place to go. Want to show up one minute to close and find the door locked and the employee ignoring  you? come on down. Want to have a laundry lose your clothing? How about the most disrespectful staff ever?  This is the first negative review I have ever posted against any business. I recently moved to this area and in 5 months have had 5 dress shirts destroyed, and another 5 lost (ultimately found), and was called a liar by one of the staff when I was complaining that I was nearly out of dress shirts for the week after 3 days of coming in and complaining because they still had not found my shirts.  I no longer go her instead I drive 24 miles out of my way to avoid this place and go to the best cleaner in town Van's at Ray and McClintock. Suggest you do the same!

Best Cleaner/Laundry in town!!! I could tell you some true horror stories about some of the cleaners in this metro area (especially about the one at Higley and Pecos), but the little lady that owns and operates this cleaner is by far the hardest working person I have ever known. She gets there early and leaves late 6 days a week. Her number one priority to make you happy and she goes out of her way to do so. I would bet that there isn't another cleaner in town that dry cleans your laundry first (to get out the stains) and then launders the clothing! Have a stain and think it's hopeless? take it here! I have seen her do amazing, impossible things with stains! She is a full service cleaner, have something delicate it gets even more attention here than you would imagine possible and she does custom alterations too! You have a choice of where you take your clothing, she knows it and wants to earn your business the old fashioned way, by doing right by you. I now drive 24 miles round trip each week to have her do my cleaning because I can trust her to do the best and treat me right! Thank you!
