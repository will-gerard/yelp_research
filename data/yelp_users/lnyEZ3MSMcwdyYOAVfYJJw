Students get discounts here! $12 for students.  Great tourist spot if you are in the area. For an outsider like me, I've never seen these many cactus in my life. Well...You are in hot-Rizona, so these cactus are happy for sure.  The garden isn't that big, but it included tons of plants/cactus! You can also find Lizards and squirrels( the ones without the big tails :D may got the name wrong...)  Remember to put on some sunscreen and bring a hat when you are in the garden. Everything was outdoor! It was super sunny/hot and dry when I was there, and I had to fully covered myself using my jacket. However, the entire trip was educational and fun!

Parking: Plenty of parking in front of the theater.  Ticketing and Seating: Students and seniors get discounts for the movie tickets. I paid $7.5 for the X-Men Apocalypse as a student. No arranged seating, so the seats are first come, first served. For popular movies, such as the X-Men, a line up could be found after you walk into the theatre. For rest of the moves, you just have to walk to the the correct show room.  Seats, Screen, and Sound The seats were alright. They weren't very comfortable for me, but for the price of $7.50 per movie, I won't complain much. The cup holders were too big for the water bottle. Sound and screen were pretty good. By all the advertisement embedded in the movie theatre, I could tell there's a lot of benefits for being in the loyalty program. Definitely sigh up for the loyalty program if you are a frequent member.   BTW, my friend left his ID in the show room after the movie, and he was able to find it the next day which was awesome. :D

I'm pretty satisfied for my decision to stay at this Westin hotel for our family trip.   PROS: 24 hour adult swimming pool with Jacuzzi. Oasis in a dessert. VERY GREEN WITH LOTS OF TREES.  Water adventure swimming. Golf training courses with discounted rate. Lots of cute coffee shops in Scottsdale. Good Platinum recognition. Sunday Brunch. Complimentary Parking. Super fast WIFI. AFFORDABLE PRICE for the hotel rooms.   CONS: Facility is kinda old. The whole resort doesn't look elegant. The elevators and the rooms need to be remodeled.   The Club room on the 9th floor sucks. Light dinner provided in the club room was just awful. The grilled vegetables were cold. The fruits, especially oranges and bananas, were not fresh. No food refills. The printer in the club room was not functional. No service at all in the club room. Don't waste your time to pay for extra for the club floor if you are not a platinum member. JUST NOT WORTH IT. If I could rate the club room alone, I would give it zero star.   The SPA is hella expensive/not worth it.   OVERALL: Swimming pool is my top priority when I go on a vacation. There are three swimming pools at this resort including the Adventure Pool, the Lazy River & Water slide, and the Aquamiel Pool (Adult Pool).  Even though the swimming pools here can not be described as phenomenal, but AREN'T YOU EXCITED FOR THE 24-HOUR LARGE SWIMMING POOL WITH JACUZZI? AT LEAST I AM, especially in the middle of the "dessert" where is super hot and dry during the day.   The on site dining is pretty expensive, but I do think the DESSO (bar-ish restaurant in the resort) is worth visiting.

Great location. Great service. Great food.  5 minutes drive from our Westin Kierland Resort. This location is one of the few restaurants in the area that open late at night. The two other restaurants we went to closed their kitchen at 12am, and only kept their bar area open until 2am. We arrived at this In-N-Out at 12:40am, and we were greeted right away at the drive-through. The service was great, and we didn't wait long for our food. The burgers were usual IN-N-OUT burgers that we get back in California, and so was the animal style fries.   In-N-Out never disappoints us. #proudcalifornians

I booked on Priceline for the total price less than a $100. Then I went to the counter and the final price went over to 300. The man at the counter gave me a coverage and a trip saver without my consent which ended up for more than 150 dollars for 5 days. Are you f**ing kidding me????? I ended up cancel them at the local thrifty instead of the airport. I canceled 4 days of the trip saver+ coverage, yet ended up paying for the first day(more than 35 dollars fuck). Never go to thrifty. Worst experience ever

Heard of this place for a while from Califonia, and finally had the chance to try it out this part Friday (05/27/16) when I was in Phoenix.   We arrived at Little Miss BBQ at around 1pm, and the line wasn't very long. It was really hot/dry that day. I was really glad we could wait under a large tent where there were continuing misting offered. One server kept handling free iced cold water to the customers waiting in line. My party and I only waited for 30-40mins in total. When we almost got to the the door, they just ran out of the lean and fatty brisket, beef ribs, and pulled pork... However, we were still able to order the rest of the items when it was our turn. We decided to go for the meat by weight after reading all of the reviews, and was very happy for the everything we had.   Items we got: Chopped Brisket (1lb)  Pork Ribs (2 lbs) 2 sausages  Sauces: Homemade sauce and spicy sauce were both very very delicious!  Food: Among all of these, my favorite one was the chopped brisket. The meat was cooked perfectly. Very tender and chewy. The meat wasn't greasy at all. Pork ribs and sausages were very tasty as well.   Seating and atmosphere: We chose indoor seating after we ordered our food. There were four/five tables inside the little shop. However, there were flies flying around our table. This is the only complain that I had for this place. I hope they could do something about that in the future. I'll keep the five star rating for now because the food was soooo good. FYI, the servers were all very friendly. At least two of them came by to our table and asked us how was the food.   Tip: In addition, when we were trying to leave at around 2:40pm, everything on the menu was sold out except the turkey... So I definitely recommend people to come to this place early! The staff told us the line would be 2 hours long when they open in the morning because everyone wanted to get the fatty brisket (such a pity this time).   Will come back for sure in the near future.

Hmmm first time trying Dutch Bros Coffee, and I'm pretty impressed.  Scottsdale is so hot and dry during this time of the year compare to San Diego, so I ordered one iced Kicker and one iced Annihilator (I can try both of them :D). The staff were super friendly and welcoming. They even offered me stamp card even I'm not local. The drive-through was quick and efficient. It is basically an In-N-Out styled coffee shop.  I ordered half sweet w/ light ice for both of the drinks. The iced Kicker felt more milky and creamer compared to the Annihilator, while the Annihilator was sweeter than the Kicker. I think the half sweet w/ light iced Annihilator was still too sweet for me, but it was perfect for my friend. The espresso ratio in the Kicker was perfect. However, I would recommend to add one more shot if you want some more espresso taste. I prefer the Kicker more :D  The large sized drink was huge. I think the medium size matches the large size in Starbucks. Definitely a great coffee stop if you are in the area!
