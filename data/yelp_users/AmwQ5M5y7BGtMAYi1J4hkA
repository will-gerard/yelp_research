Best Korean BBQ in Arizona! Their lunch special is a great deal and you get a little bit of everything in terms of BBQ =)

I'm from Cali, San Francisco Bay Area to be exact and this place has the best Korean BBQ. I love their lunch special that comes with 3 different meat. Spicy pork is definitely my fav and yes so good that I find myself craving it on a weekly basis. Soooo good!

Delish chimichanga, enchilada, chips/sala and their Pina Colada is the best I've ever had. Unfortunately their "bar" isn't always open (1/3 times I've been here) Have been here a few times in the last month or so...definitely one of my new regular spots.

This place has horrible horrible customer service!  And this was from the store's manager!  Our office staff orders from them on a daily basis and I myself order at least $50 worth of food when I do so they're definitely losing out on that since I'm now calling the other location close by to place my orders.  I wish there were other places that delivered in my area.  Haha looking at the other dissatisfied reviews for this location it sounds like the manager at this location has major customer service issues!  I'm seriously considering calling corporate...wondering if that would even do anything?
