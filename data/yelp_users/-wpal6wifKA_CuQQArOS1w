Beautiful desert garden with plenty of cactus varieties to see.  Loved the butterfly exhibit they had going this spring- very kid-friendly, and plenty of butterflies everywhere.  Sadly I missed the Chihuly exhibit, but it was still a lovely time there.  Bring sunscreen, a hat, a bottle of water (you can refill your bottle at water fountains throughout the park).  The garden store has cacti and succulents on sale, and the gift shop is worth taking a browse through.

If you're looking for antiques, or just feel like taking a stroll down memory lane, Brass Armadillo is the place to visit!  Aisles and aisles of antiques, well organized and well spaced.  Great for housewares, books, knicknacks, cookware... lots of goodies that can be useful for people moving into a new place, or just looking to take in a blast from the past. Pretty empty on a Monday morning, it's easy to walk around without much hassle, definitely no crowds, and the people who roll in on Monday mornings are kind of quirky and interesting.  Glad I made the visit while I was in Phoenix!

Excellent!  I came here for lunch while visiting friends in Phoenix, and this lunch was delicious.  I had the hunter's stew with kielbasa, and the kielbasa was one of the best I've ever had.  Very tender, flavorful, and as the name suggests, the dish was very generously portioned.  Served with stewed pickled cabbage over noodles, this is a very hearty, filling dish.  We ordered some potato pierogi's as an appetizer-- if I had known how delicious these were, I might have ordered a bunch just to have as my meal.  Fantastic pierogis, delicious sauce.  We dipped bread into the leftover sauce on the plate when we were finished.  My friend ordered the stuffed cabbage-- this was also a delicious dish, very flavorful, and not quite so heavy as the hunter's stew.  I would easily come back here for another meal if I find myself in Phoenix again.

This place is great.  I wish we had a pasty place where I live!  I came here randomly on a whim, and was not disappointed.  It's amazing how many flavors of filling they have here, and from what I tried, all were great!  I loved the lamb vindaloo and the accompanying yogurt sauce.  Delicious.  My friend got the original pasty, and this was also good-- perfect for people who have a mellower palate.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, people seem to love to work here, and they also love their facial hair-- our server was rockin a great hipster moustache.  Servings are generous, service is excellent, parking is easy.  I would love to come back here again someday.

I'm surprised to see the poor reviews on this place.  I came here to shop for goodies to go on a camping trip, and this store was pretty awesome.  Produce was very fresh, reasonably priced, and I loved that you could mix and match to make your own 6-pack of beers.  Staff was very friendly and helpful, parking was convenient, and it was right next to Costco, so we filled up on cheap gas, loaded the car, and were on the road to Payson for some camping in no time.  The beer sausages they sell here are delicious.  Highly recommend trying them!

This museum is amazing.  If you have any interest in music on any level, this place is definitely worth a visit.  They have instruments from virtually every country in the world!  Not only are the displays fantastic, but rent the headphones to get the full effect-- as you near each display, you can hear the musical instruments being played.  It was really an incredible museum experience- something special, definitely not to be missed.

I don't live in Phoenix, so I don't really know what the general standard is for Thai food here, but this place wasn't very good.  I ordered the spicy beef salad and the tom yum soup, and ordered both medium spicy.  Neither dish was spicy at all, the beef was overcooked and underseasoned, and the tom yum soup was too salty and lacked substance.  It was basically shrimp broth with some sliced mushrooms.  Service was good, but everything was definitely overpriced, especially for the quality of the dishes served.  Very disappointed.

This place was pretty much awesome.  I have been missing southern bbq, and this place hit the spot.  We got here close to 7 without realizing that was their closing time, but staff was so warm and friendly and accommodating for us.  My friend and I shared a 1/2 lb of the pulled pork, which you can get with slices of white bread to make sandwiches, and we ordered creamed corn, green beans, and coleslaw as our sides.  Definitely go for the creamed corn-- creamy and delicious!  The green beans were good, filled with little bits of pork in it, and it had a very subtle kick to it.  The coleslaw was refreshing and tasty, great seasoning.  The pulled pork was delicious, super tender, juicy, and went great with both the sweet and spicy bbq sauces they had to offer.  This place thinks of everything- from ziploc bags for takeout to wet wipes for your bbq sauce stained fingers.  We had wanted to order the ribs, but they had already sold out!!  Next time I'm in Phoenix, I will definitely come back!  Just plan your visit well-- they are closed on Sundays and Mondays!

Delicious shakes and ice cream sandwiches right along the main drag of Tempe.  Prices are reasonable, metered parking is easy, staff is helpful and friendly, atmosphere is bright and spacious.  My strawberry shake was tasty, my friend's mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich with freshly baked mint chocolate chip cookies was yummy too.  I'd come back here again if I lived in the area!

Coooooool place!  I loved it the moment we walked in.  Another late night dinner for us on our road trip, my friend and I found this place in downtown Scottsdale, and enjoyed some tasty beers and dinner with a German flair.  I had the Moroccan lamb brat with sauerkraut and mango chutney upon our server's recommendation- delicious!  Very nice combination of flavors.  I also had a side of Belgian fries with chipotle mayo dip, also very good, nice and crispy on the outside, but thickly cut, and soft and potato-y on the inside.  Portions were big-- I would say you could split a small order of the fries between 2 people and be satisfied. My friend ordered the schnitzel, which came with home fries, so we were not short of taters!  We also had no idea how big everything would be, so we also ordered the beet salad, which they kindly split into 2 portions for us.  This was big too!  Easy to split between 3-4 people if you just want this a small appetizer salad, although I was grateful for the generous portioning, as it was a very nice salad- the beets were sweet and cooked just right, and they had a nice, warm, melty flavor.  Nice ambience outside with the hanging lights.  I really enjoyed our dinner here, and would easily come again if I'm ever in the area to try some other dishes.  Service was top notch, and prices were very reasonable.
