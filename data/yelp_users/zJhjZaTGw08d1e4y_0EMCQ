attended this place for a birthday party.  My one year old daughter loved it!  Area is a little run-down, but the prices were good and staff was nice.  I don't really understand why people are complaining when their kids "get toys ripped out of their hands by other kids".  That happens everywhere and shouldn't influence the review of the business!

we tried this restaurant on Valentine's Day, and I really regret coming here.  First of all, we keep getting coupons for this place from the circulars, and decided to go ahead and try it since we both love Italian food.  When we walked in, there was a sign that said "Seat Yourself" so we did.  The place wasn't very busy.. with about 1/3 of the 15 or so tables available.  It took around 10 minutes for a waitress to come by, and without even saying hello or introducing herself, she asked what we wanted to order.  I was a waitress for years, and thought it was very strange that she didn't even ask for our drink order.  We said we'd have some wine, and a couple waters first, then order.  Well that was a big mistake because it took her nearly 20 minutes to come back.  At this point, I was still pretty forgiving, since I figured another server must have called out sick or something, or this lady was pissed that she had to work on Valentine's Day.  When she finally returned, she didn't apologize, or explain what took so long.  We both ordered a ravioli dish that was okay, and very small, it was almost like a kid's dish.  We're not big eaters, and even still the food portion was tiny.  I would rate the food 6 out of 10.  I would NOT recommend this place if you value good customer service.  Go to Bamboo Grille next door, much better food, and great customer service.

i LOVE this place!  Emily J. rocks!  Nice building, relaxing environment, and very professional.  Great prices for their services!  I've only gotten haircuts (around $25) and partial highlights (around $65) here, but now i won't go anywhere else.

Love this Fry's!  great prices, super friendly service, and always clean and organized.  I also (like a previous reviewer) had a hard time adjusting when they reorganized the store, but I am okay now  :)   I almost exclusively grocery shop at Fry's locations, and happen to live down the street from this one.  If I ever moved to a different neighborhood, I'd probably still drive over to this Fry's location.
