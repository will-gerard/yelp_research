My server was Caitlyn.  She was amazing and very accommodating to me and my service dog.  Very polite and easy going.  Always checked to see if I needed anything.  The wings are cooked to order.  And I drive over 45  minutes just to dine at this NNY.

Coming from an Asian,  this place is over priced and the portions are a joke for the pho special.  There are many other places that give literally twice as much for less 6 dollars.

Been coming here for 5 plus years.  Amazing Crew! Knowledgeable with resources to help you.  Best pricing with honesty integrity opinions.  Allowed me to use a personal vehicle of theirs to run errands while my car was being serviced.  Who does that?!  James is a great guy and will be honest about inspection and quality of parts.  I highly recommend going here over anybody else.  I bring all my cars here.  Great job Lightning Lube!

Will never go back.  Went in here to fix the cruise Control only to find my audio controls didn't work cause they cut the wires.  Brought it back and they fixed the audio by but the brake lights didn't work cause they cut the wires to the cruise control.  So I get pulled over and got a ticket.  Called them back and denied it and said I'm being a pain in the ass. But there were wires on the floor when they fixed it.  They short circuit the breaks and basically said Oh well.  Luis was the mechanic who worked on my car and I saw him soldering wires back and using electric tape.  I'll never go back.  Hassle going back three different times,  they broke the problem even more,  broke the break lights,  and I got a ticket.  These guys are not good.  Took it to Honda and got it fixed in an hour.  Aggressive attitudes at this place.
