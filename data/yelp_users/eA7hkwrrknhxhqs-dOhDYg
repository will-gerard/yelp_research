I went to Wrigley with the Network of Business Women.  It was my first time there.  I had no idea where it was, but once I got there, I was pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere was so beautiful and relaxed.  It was a great place to have lunch.  I had a steak salad and it was absolutely yummy.    Great history on the house...I need to go back for their free tours.  I think they are at 10 and 3 everyday they are open.  (Check on that first)I heard they have a great Sunday Brunch, so I will be making my way out there again.  I would love to hang out on their patio one fall morning or evening.  Either way it would be awesome.

Tuesday Night Wine and Bruschetta Special Rawks! I love Postino's just for that.  $20 gets you a bottle of wine and a tray of bruschetta.  This is an AWESOME deal.  My girlfriends and I love it.  We can sit and talk and indulge in great wine and food.  Tips:  If you have a large group, make a reservation.  Plan to get there early, it gets packed.  The Tuesday Night special starts at 8pm.

The AAWL is totally awesome.  I volunteered here on and off for a few months before I adopted my doggy, Mickey Mongo.  He's a chihuahua/shiba inu mix and a great dog all around.  I thought of going directly to Maricopa County Animal Control, but I'm glad I went to the AAWL.  The AAWL is Phoenix's oldest no-kill shelter and really concentrates on training and working with behaviors.  They have great assessments and plenty of pets to match any personality style.  The volunteers and staff both have the dogs and cats best interest in mind.  Before I adopted Mickey, I fostered him.  I really wanted to make sure that he was the right dog for me.  After careful thought and plenty of conversations with the adoption specialists, I knew I had to have him.  Mickey was up-to-date on his vaccinations, microchipped, and the first vet appointment is free.  Also your adoption fee goes to ensure that the AAWL can continue to operate in our community.    If you are looking to adopt a family pet, please stop by the AAWL.

Almost every Sunday morning, my boyfriend and I go bowling at Tempe Village Lanes.  About a year ago, my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to go bowling.  Up until that time, I had only bowled 5 times my entire life.  He; however, had been on leagues before, but since moving to AZ, he hadn't gone in quite awhile.    My first go around was awful.  I think I bowled a 60 or 70.  But I'm a persistent gal and I continued to go with him.  And now I bowl about a 130.  Anyway, we go Sunday mornings because they have an awesome deal.  It is $1.69 a game if you start bowling between the hours of 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.  That's a smoking deal considering games typically run about $4.25 a game.  Shoe rentals are also a bit pricey, but I don't worry about that anymore.  I bought my own shoes for $35 and because we go so often, its worth the investment.  It is easy to get a lane on Sunday mornings and a great way to spend time with your significant other and/or your family.  If you are at Tempe Village Lanes, I am most likely there in the a.m.  Drop by and say hello!

Never had chicken and waffles before, but I was definitely intrigued.  I saw a Throwdown episode on chicken and waffles.  I thought to myself I need to try that.  Lo-Lo's is a great place to try this interesting combination of food.    I had the two piece dark meat with waffles and Kool-aid.  I couldn't finish it so I brought it home.  It was even yummy as a leftover.  Yummy in my tummy is how I'm going to leave it.  :P

My boyfriend and I ate here at couple of weeks ago.  I had never eaten Korean BBQ before so we decided to try it.  The food was good, but what I really liked in the restaurant was the fact that we could cook our own food.  It was a lot of fun and something my boyfriend and I could do together.  The downside to this is that you come out smelling like food but all in all, a good experience.

I love to go to Bandera to start my evening off.  I've had there dinners in the past, but the most memorable food item there is their Dip Duo with Tortilla chips and their yummy Mojitos.  Bandera is a cool place to start off the night with a good appetizer and a strong drink.

I know it was after lunch on a Sunday, but I was totally not impressed with this place.  You have to know something is wrong when everyone is sitting at the bar and stares at you while you walk in.  No one greeted us and we figured right then and there not a good place for lunch.  Bad service is sooo not cool.

I decided one day to work outside the office.  I had to concentrate on some writing and sometimes my work is not the best place to do that because I share an office.  I decided to go to Bunna, but was sidetracked.  I saw P.Croissants and had to go in.  I ordered a ham and egg breakfast sandwich and an iced mocha.  It was probably not the healthiest thing to eat, but I didn't care.  It was really good.    They have free wi-fi and I was able to work outside on my project.  A great start to my morning with yummy food and a comfortable work environment. :)

I love Lisa's Bowl of Balls.  It is a very yummy and satisfying dish.  I go to Lisa G's just for her meatballs when I'm craving meat.  I highly recommend this dish.

My boyfriend and I decided to go to Copper Star Coffee after reading reviews on Yelp.  It wasn't a hard sell because I'm a huge fan of cupcakes.  And many of the reviewers were raving about the cupcakes, so I had to try one.  We both loved the coffehouse.  Great drinks, great prices, and yummmmyyyyy cupcakes.  My boyfriend read his book and I did some work on my laptop.  The environment was cozy and comfortable.  I definitely will be coming back again.

Yesterday I was on the hunt to find a restaurant in Phoenix that served lobster bisque.  Unfortunately, I never found it.   What I did find was Firebirds.  The only thing I had yesterday was a fruit smoothie.  I was so bogged down with work that I missed lunch and by the time dinner rolled around I was famished.  All day I was craving lobster bisque, I went all over town looking for it.  My hunger got the best of me so I stopped in at Firebirds.    I've never been but I saw the Shrimp and Strawberry Salad on the list, and I know I had to have that.  In obervation of Lent, I was not eating meat.  So this was the perfect choice.  I ate the bar and had a drink (my usual 3 Olive Cherry and Diet Coke), watch Apolo Ohno get DQed from the short track (that was BS call in my opinion), and I scarfed down my salad.  It was sooooo yummy and surprisingly very filling.   I think the thing I like most about the restaurant was my meal.  The bartender was very nice.  I think her name was Callie.  She was attentive and quick to bring me my drink (definite plus).  I would like to try other meals.  My only minus is that I felt the prices were a little high for a chain restaurant should be.  All in all, I had a good experience and I'll be back for that salad. YUM!

After putting out a twitter alert for a pizza place along the Lightrail, my fellow tweeters urged me to check out Z Pizza.  Even before my tweet, when I was at the Mayor's coffee event at the Heard Museum (yesterday), we received the Phoenix Passport Book.   My friend, Seth, told me that there was a coupon in the book and we should try it out.  There's no doubt that Z Pizza had to be a place I needed to try this weekend.  Instead of taking the Lightrail, we decided to drive.  (FYI, the closest Lightrail stop is Thomas and Central and it's only a short walk away.) We liked the friendly service and the comfortable atmosphere.  We ordered the Hawaiian Pizza and it was yummy.  We ordered the large because with the coupon, you get $5 off of a $20+ order.  The large pizza was $20.56.  We ate a few slices and took the rest home.    We sat and ate on their comfortable couch. Afterwards, the setting was so comfortable, we stayed and read our books.  I wanted to try the desserts at The Pink Spot, but I was too full.  All in all, Z Pizza had a nice atmosphere and good food.

After a bad experience at a Thai restaurant, I swore off eating Thai food.  I don't like spicy food and I was thoroughly convinced that all Thai food is spicy (even if you tell them you want it mild).  After talking to a colleague, he told me to try Lemongrass. He spoke so highly of it that I had to give Thai food a another try.  So I did and to my dismay, I loved it.  I checked Yelp before going and everyone recommended the Thai Basil.  That's what I ordered and I loved it.  I also got the Thai Iced Tea and that was yummy in my tummy sweetness.  Lemongrass rocks and I will be back.

I had the opportunity to go to Firesky last night for a fundraiser.  I can't comment on the rooms or spa, but I would like to comment on the space where we had the event.  This was a great spot for the Phoenix Chapter of Dress for Success to kick off their first fundraiser.  Also from my understanding, Firesky was the main sponsor and underwrote the cost of the event.    It look like there were over 150 attendees and with a runway for a fashion show it accomodated us all well.  The wait staff was very friendly and the food was awesome.  I loved the dessert bar at the end.  They had little cakes and chocolate fondue.  YUM!!  If I have to organize a special event, I will definitely keep this location in mind.

One thing my boyfriend and I like to do during the hot days of summer is to relax and read a good book while sipping an iced coffee at a local coffeehouse.  This week we went to Solo Cafe.  We were kind of hungry so we thought maybe we could get a sandwich there.  Unfortunately, they do not have a kitchen and the only food they serve are pastries at this time.  Luckily Solo is in a strip mall with food options.  We left and came back.  I had an Iced Cafe Latte and my boyfriend had a Iced Cafe Mocha.  Both very good drinks.  Also, the barista was very nice and seem really laidback and cool.  Another plus is that they have free wi-fi.  Important for me because I was doing catching up on some work while my boyfriend read his book.  This is definitely a place we will go back to.

This is a great place to go to for Happy Hour.  They have a daily Happy Hour from 4-7pm.  Some 1/2 off drinks, apppetizers and sushi.  I'm not much of a sushi eater.  The bartender goes..."Do you want the sushi menu?" I told him, "No, I don't like sushi." He then said, "How could you live in Arizona and not like sushi?" And I told him, "How could I be Asian and not like sushi?" And we laughed.  Anyway, what I love the most about Geisha A Go Go is The Hello Kitty.  It's a mixed drink made with a strawberry infused saki with a strawberry puree.  Pure yummy-ness!  The other thing cool about this place, oddly, are the bathrooms.  Definitely check that out, too!

Maizie's is an awesome place.  It's comfortable.  The food is yummy and an overall enjoyable experience.  I went to Maizie's for a lunch meeting with a colleague.  Our server was very hospitable and the food came out fast.  I had the special that day which was a gyro.  The portion sizes are big and I was thoroughly full when I left the restaurant.  Great place for lunch and I hear it's awesome for dinner.  I will have to check that out as well.

I like going to Red Robin; however, I do not particularly like the one located at the Tempe Marketplace.  My boyfriend and I decided to eat dinner there last Sunday night.  We were pretty hungry and we thought that Red Robin would hit the spot.  I was looking forward to the Salmon Burger.    We were seated immediately in a booth.  We looked through the menu and decided what we wanted to eat.  After five minutes, no one came to greet us.  Waitresses kept walking by, but no one stopped to say hi or get our drink order.  We waited five more minutes, by that time we were looking around to see if we had a waitress.  Still no one...we decided to leave and go to In-N-Out Burger.  I was really looking forward to a Salmon Burger, but I don't like bad service much less no service.  The location was not busy at all and there was no reason from my end why someone couldn't come up to us and let us know what was going on.  Those other waitresses passed by us and even looked right at us.  They knew we weren't getting served.  They could have possibly kept me there if they acknowledged that we were there and would locate our waiter/waitress.  I know this is one incident, but it really puts a bad taste in my mouth.

I am not a big fan of chain restaurants.  I am a firm believer in supporting local business.  But I make an exception for Ruby Tuesday.   My most favorite thing on their menu is the mini-combo.  You can get 2 sliders with fries plus the endless salad bar for as low as $8.99.  You can get cheeseburger sliders, turkey, buffalo chicken, crabcake and salmon patty.  I've tried them all.   I am most in love with their salad bar.  It is well stocked and always fresh.  If you are looking for something quick, affordable and healthy (you don't have to eat the fries), then Ruby Tuesday is a great option.

I love trying new local restaurants and when Sens opened up, it was top on my list.  Alas, I think I put it on a pedestal.  I thought the food was overpriced and not very good.    I love tapas and dim sum, but I was disappointed with the choices at Sen. We ordered the Shu Mai.  I knew I couldn't go wrong with this order.  I love Shu Mai, but this version of it I unfortunately didn't like.  The wasabi was so overpowering, even after I scrapped it off the top.  We also had the Lime Mint Beef which I felt was too acidic.    After it was all said and done, we spent over $50 and left hungry.  :(

I was looking through my reviews and can't believe I haven't posted a review of Hanny's.  I love Hanny's!  It's an awesome place to go to on a weekend evening.  It's right off the lightrail.  Drinks and food are very affordable and it has an awesome sleek uptown feel without the attitude.  Now I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about the first time my boyfriend and I went to this establishment.    We went to a Phoenix Suns game and afterwards we were looking for a place to hang out and chill.  We walked around  Downtown Phoenix for a good 20 minutes.  We weren't interested in the sports bars around the Purple Palace.  We came across Hanny's.  After we saw that they had appletinis for only $5, I was sold.  We walked in and thought that it was a really sleek place.  We also couldn't believe that the prices were so reasonable.  We loved the fact that the seats reclined and they had a DJ spinning.  It was almost too good to be true.  When my boyfriend and I were seated, I went up the bathroom.  It reminded me of a bath house.  I rushed back down with a look of panic on my face.  I thought it was a a restaurant that catered to "Swingers." We scanned the room and it was mostly couples.  We were almost convinced of it.  We started send out a barrage of text messages to find out the real truth about this place.  Only 2 people knew about Hanny's.  Luckily, they reassured us that it wasn't a hangout for swinging couples. LOL!!  Anyway, Hanny's is one of our favs in Phoenix and we are happy to have stumble upon it.  I love the fact that the owners saw such potential in making an old department store into a hip hot spot.  If you are looking for something to do on a Friday or Saturday night, I highly recommend taking a group of friends or a date and having a drink at Hanny's.

After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots.   As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)

I love Preppy Pets and so does my doggy, Mickey Mongo.  I use their day care services.  I like that the owners greet and say goodbye everytime I drop-off and pick-up my dog.  They also give me a rundown of Mickey's day. Preppy Pets has a pet webcam so I can check-in on Mickey to make sure he's behaving.  It puts my mind at ease to know that my dog is well taken care, can socialize with other dogs and it doesn't costs an arm and a leg for doggy day care.

On Sunday mornings, I love to go out for breakfast/brunch.  Sunrise Cafe is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast in Maricopa.  The staff is friendly, the restaurant is always clean and the food is great.    Last week, I took my dad there for breakfast. On the menu they have 6 dishes in a category called Mini Breakfast.  My dad ordered from that section and it was just enough for him.    I had a build your own omelete.  I ate half of it and was full.  I took the rest home and the next day had it for breakfast and it was still really yummy.  The thing I love the most about Sunrise Cafe are their hashbrowns.  OMG....they are so freakin' awesome.  Crispy on the outside, just the way I like it.  If you are ever in Maricopa and looking for a breakfast spot, this is a great place to go.  Be warned the place is small and sometimes there is a wait. (Yes, it's popular)  They have you wait outside.  So if it's chilly out, bring a jacket.

Ono Hawaiian BBQ is a great place if you are looking for something healthy and affordable.  I love their $5 value meal.  You have your choice between chicken, beef, pork and it comes with boiled cabbage, drink and choice of steamed rice or macaroni salad.  To cut back on the carbs, I just get a double order of cabbage.    There are many fast food options in that area, but if you are looking for something fast and healthy, Ono Hawaiian is a great place to go.

I've only been to Arcadia Tavern once, but I love the atmosphere.  Tons and tons of TVs...if you are a sports fanatic, this place is totally for you.  There's not a bad seat in the whole joint.    I ordered the chicken wings and loved that they came grilled.  The wings weren't wimpy, they were nice and plump.  It was a great meal.    My boyfriend and I will definitely be back.  Who knows...it might be our Saturday hangout when college football season starts up again.

Teakwoods is awesome and awesome for a variety of reasons.  Aside from the fact that they are huge supporter of my work at Crisis Nursery, their food is so yummy.  I love the pretzels and if anything, you should go in there just for that.  With any entree you have option of getting tater tots.  Tater tots rock!  Be prepared for big portion sizes.  You will definitely be taking a doggy bag home with you.  Also their wait staff is very attentive and they work very quickly.  If you are looking for a place to kick back with friends and family.  This is a great establishment to do that.  Great food, great service, fun atmosphere and peanuts.  Who could ask for anything more?

I went to Dave's Electric for a Happy Hour.  The group I met for Happy Hour was rather large, so I decided to buy my drink at the bar.  It took them at least 10 minutes to take my order.  There were 2 people behind the bar taking orders and 1 at the cash register.  It wasn't a big bar to begin with and the bar area wasn't that busy.    One crotchity old guy was talking to his friend and said something on the lines of "Geez it's taking forever to get a beer." The lady at the cash register told him that she was closing the register and then had some pretty passive agressive statements to say to him.  The old guy was like, I wasn't even talking to you and then went on a rant.  Even though he was rude, he had a point.    I've been to bigger bars, that were busier with the same amount of people, and had my drink in a timely manner.  Even an acknowledgement (like, I'll be with you in a minute), is better than totally ignoring the customer.    Anyway, I had Dave's Electric Brew and it was alright.  I went and sat with my group.  I tried to order the crab cakes, but they were out.  So I ordered Edamame.  It took about 30 minutes to get my order.  I think the Edamame was overcooked because they were really squishy and difficult to eat.  It also took a very long time to get my bill and pay.  I know my group was large, but it just took a long time.  I figure the reason for the substandard customer service to Dave's Electric is that it's a new establishment and they are working out the kinks.  I hope they can work out these issues.  It's a great location right off the lightrail and they have a nice patio area.

I had the opportunity to attend the Grand Opening of Howl at the Moon.  They had complimentary food and drinks which was great.  Our waitress was really quick and on the ball.  That's what should be expected on opening night.   What I really liked about Howl at the Moon was the entertainment.  This is a rock n' roll dueling piano bar, but it's way more.  It started with the pianos and then as the night progressed, it was a full on band.  They had drums, guitars and even a saxophone.  The entertainers energy and humor had the crowd going.  I also love the fact that bar staff got into the show as well.  They were up on the stage and on the bar dancing.  I think Howl at the Moon is a great addition to the Old Town Scottsdale Nightlife.  And something that everyone can enjoy...not just 30K Millionaires, pervy trouts or cougars on the prowl.  Check it out!!

This place is pretty darn cool. I envisioned just a regular diner like Waffle House or Eat-Rite Diner (fellow St. Louisans would know), but it was much more.   I loved the bar area. Alcohol in a diner is cool. Normally I go to a diner after drinking, but sometimes you want more. Or you can start your night there and stay...whatever.   I loved the decor. Old school Bettie Page rockabilly style was cool. It reminded me of my sister, who I hope will come visit me soon. I really want to show her this place.   Anyway, I went into Sucker Punch Sally's for breakfast. I wanted an omelet, but the menu items didn't interest me. They let me build my own and it was very good. My hash browns were YUMMY as well!!   I will be back. Maybe next time it will be for drinks and dinner :)

Until I ordered from Truckin' Good Food, I was a crepe virgin.  So fittingly, my first crepe was called "My First Time."  My First Time also became my second time...just so you know.  I love the nutella and I love bananas, and at first, that's all I wanted in my crepe.  Jeff persuaded me to get it with walnuts as well.  I'm glad I did.  It was delish!  Truckin' Good Food is awesome.  I look forward to trying other crepes and seeing them around in their new truck.

Yumma, yumma, YUMMY!!   I was at the Biltmore and craving a hamburger for lunch.  I decided to stop in at Zinburger.  The place was packed ; however, I found a spot at the bar and within 15 minutes the bartender took my order and my burger was right in front of me.  I ordered the Zinburger.  The burger was cooked to perfection.  I will definitely be back and I will bring others to enjoy Zinburger's wonderful burgers.

Ah-mazziinnngggg!!! Absinthe was one of the best shows I have seen on the strip in a long time.  I've seen most of the Cirque du Soleil shows and while they're all great shows, Absinthe is a mixture of acrobatics and raunchy comedy.  Just like the other reviews, this show is not for everyone.    I loved the intimate setting of the venue.  I thought I was the only person who knew of Esquivel and loved the fact that you waited for the show listening to his new age bachelor pad music. I wasn't hip on the uncomfortable chairs, but after the performance started, the chairs really didn't matter.  The performers are so close and their abilities of contortion, balance and stamina are mind blowing.  Also, Penny and The Gazillionaire had me nearly peeing my pants because they were so hilarious and you can't beat a comedy duo that can get an "old, Republican looking" woman to motorboat an "easy" slut.  That had the crowd going wild.  All in all, Absinthe is a MUST see (for non-prudish people) and it's worth every penny.

I'm not really one to discuss waxing on such a public forum, but I had a great experience at Urban Wax that warranted a review on Yelp.  I love that Urban Wax is locally owned.  Urban Wax looks very sophisticated and is very clean and the staff are very professional.    They have great pricing for first-time customers.  Free eye, lip or underarm or half off brazilian or bikini waxes (includes a free panty).  I don't know any waxing salons that have this offer.    If you are looking for an awesome locally owned waxing salon, look no further.  Also, let them know I referred you :)
