I went here 3-4 times and the first time I had a great experience (night staff) and they even gave me free copies onto vellum (didn't even ask for it!) and advised me with what I needed help with.   5 stars!  The second time I got major attitude from the lady that works the front counter and I had told her exactly what I wanted.  She later had a man talk to me that was just as condescending. Left the place feeling like I didn't get what I wanted.  You know I am a paying customer too. Learn that students are your clients as well.  Went down to 3 stars..  Then the third or fourth time I went in, explained to the lady again what I wanted.. Her nose was up in the air...  Yah I got my copies but don't be a complete snob to customers and clients (be friendly - I gave you a couple of chances... there is a way to explain things in a nice way and when you mess up my minimal order and pass me over to the guy again.. you got issues)  2 stars  If you go there, go in the evening - it's a skeleton crew but they are very helpful.  If you go there during the day, they will still get it done - just avoid snobby lady!  Overall they do good work.

This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area and the best!  The food is very delicious and the owner, Preet, is very hospitable.  Too bad I no longer live in Ahwatukee.  All I could think of when I was at a restaurant down the street from my place earlier, is how mouth-watering Star of India's chicken tikka masala is.... Yumm!  A must visit!

This a long overdue review!! I absolutely love this place.  I went here for years and every time I come to Arizona I can't help but make an appointment.  When I lived in Tempe, I would get my hair done (highlights and cut/styled) by Ashley and eyebrows done by Danielle.  I got to know them pretty well and miss them. They are both amazing!  Every time I walked out of there, I felt like a star.  They definitely pampered you and made sure you were very pleased with their services.  The ambiance is great and overall just a pleasing experience :)
