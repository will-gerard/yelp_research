One night during my visit to Arizona, I was extremely hungry and craving sushi. Dining at traditional sushi restaurants was not an option ($$$$). I searched all over town for AYCE sushi and Sushi Q was the only restaurant that Yelp returned within Chandler, Mesa, Tempe, Phoenix, and Scottsdale. I jumped into my car and quickly roared out to Sushi Q at around 7:00pm. Sushi Q is located in a strip mall next to a seedy liquor store. When I arrived during happy hour, there were only 3 people in the restaurant! There's no need to beat the dinner rush here.   I sat at the bar and designated myself as an AYCE customer. After perusing the order menu, I was upset to discover an 8 order limit on the nigiri. 8 orders = 16 pieces. When I eat AYCE sushi in California, I typically average ~50 pieces, with a personal record of 64. Nobody cares how much you order in California, as long as you don't throw up on premises. Apparently not the case in stingy Arizona.  The nigiri menu is sparse with limitations to the basic fish. Uni was not an option on the menu. Neither were any premium fish (not even off the AYCE menu). I ordered the standard choices: albacore, mackerel, red snapper, tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallop, and yellowtail. The rice was served at room temperature as it should be. The fish quality of the tuna, salmon, and red snapper was acceptable, but the presentation for the other sushi was poor. Excessive ponzu sauce and green onions were applied on top of the yellowtail, mackerel, and albacore, to the point where I could not taste the distinct flavor of each fish. See photos for the sloppy preparation and the overuse of onions. The quality was disappointing even for a Korean sushi chef.  For economic purposes, Sushi Q expects AYCE customers to fill up on appetizers and rolls rather than the fish. I feared leaving with a half full stomach, so I ordered rolls and appetizers after the nigiri. Rolls do not have order limits, but premium rolls were strategically removed from the AYCE menu. I asked for the negi salmon roll, yellowtail roll, and rainboll roll. The rolls were handled by a Hispanic sushi chef. The rainbow roll was standard, although the rice was a bit stiff. Yellowtail roll was a salty disaster, with excessive garlic/chili sauce drenched over the fish that spread to the rice. Fortunately, the negi salmon roll was acceptable with minimal sauces used and generous amount of salmon in each piece.   Be aware that appetizers are full orders. I ordered agedashi tofu expecting just a few pieces of hot tofu. Instead, I received a basket full of fried tofu enough to feed a family of 3. The agedashi tofu was a joke. It was supposed to be served in a broth with Katsuobushi, Japanese onions, some rice wine, and soy sauce, but all that was given was a bowl of soy sauce separated from the tofu.  In the end, I left with a full stomach but was dissatisfied with the quality of food consumed. I came to eat sushi but was instead instructed to order mediocre rolls engulfed in puddles of assorted sauces. The 16 piece limit is a severe limitation that renders the AYCE option as not cost-effective ($23.95 for dinner).

Just about every food guide for Phoenix pointed me towards Barrio Cafe as a "must try", so I decided to check out that award winning restaurant. But after being told there was a minimum one hour wait for a table and seeing $22 enchiladas/$12 tortas on the menu that included a heavy fusion-spin, I decided that it wasn't for me.  I looked up a similar Mexican cafe nearby that also serves traditional Yucatan and Mexico City style dishes, and ended up outside a building painted in purple-flamingo pink called "Asi Es La Vida". From the color of the building to the surreal Frida Kahlo paintings that adorn the walls to the countryside Mexican music, this place had the vibrant and inviting personality that I liked. In addition, the prices were a little more reasonable compared to Barrio Cafe, so I gave it a try.  Based on what I found on the menu, I determined Asi Es La Vida prepares regional Mexican cuisine with a Mexico-City flair. I ordered the recalendato because it combined two of my Mexican favorites, mole and cochinita pibil.  My lunch began with thick corn chips that reminded me of tostada. It was accompanied with two of the best tasting homemade salsas I've ever had. The red salsa was my favorite because of its predominantly smoky profile, while the green salsa appeared to be a more bright, a verdant puree of coriander-mint and green chile. They're more like thick dips rather than the typical salsas at taco stands which I find to be either too chunky or too thin, and overly one-dimensional (simply variations with increasing intensity of heat and no distinct smoky tones available).  I did not do my research so I got "hustled" by the waitress - I said yes to guacamole when asked (who would say no, I later realized guac and chips were not a complimentary side). It came with another plate of chips. The guacamole wasn't assembled tableside, but tasted like it was made one by one to order with lots of avocado pulp, so it was actually worth the extra $3.95. The amount of lime flavor added was just right, not too bright.   The main course was decent but not exceptional. It tasted like a comforting dish prepared at someone's home. The rice was super light and bland, the beans were not refried with melted American cheese (thank goodness not border-style) but instead slow cooked with white cheese sprinkled on top like it is done in Mexico. I thought that the cochinita pibil was prepared better than the mole poblano. For the cochinita, the meat was served in chunks rather than like pulled pork, but the marinade was balanced between acidic and sweet. The only improvement I would suggest is to cook it more "picante", it was flat and missing an accent. On the other hand, the mole was a big disappointment since it was overly sweet without a hint of spicy flavor. It didn't have layered, complex, or intense bittersweet tones of the mole poblano that I have eaten before. The mole wasn't something I wanted to lick off my fork.  Overall, Asi Es La Vida was a pleasant change of pace from the Sonoran, Tex-Mex, and Southwestern food that is popular in Phoenix. The service was attentive and the restaurant is family-owned. It's not a loud place like Barrio Cafe plus there is tablecloth, so it could work as a cozy date restaurant. The food was more traditional than contemporary-fusion style. To best honest, I wasn't blown away by the food, but it tasted better than the other Mexican food I ate while staying in Phoenix.

Out of all the Vegas hotels off the strip, Palms Place is probably the best match for those seeking a trendy, elegant, and affordable experience, either for travel or pleasure.  I stayed at PP's studio suite in 2013 for business travel. For only $69 per weekday (plus $20/day resort fee), it was about half the price of comparable suites located on the strip. PP's suite covered 600 square feet, comfortable for 2 people and spacious enough to fit 4 or more guests.  I was most impressed with the suite's comfortable setting and contemporary layout. Right by the entrance, you are welcomed with a mini kitchen to store groceries in a refrigerator or cook a light meal with the microwave or electric stove. The center of the room is furnished with a king sized bed fitted with silky Italian bedding. A Panasonic plasma 42" TV is conveniently mounted on the wall across from the bed. You'll notice that the flooring is constructed with hardwood, which adds to the room's architectural elegance. If you continue walking towards the windows and brush aside the curtains, a view of the strip will be revealed to you, which is brilliant during nighttime. Relax on the modern sofa bed by the window and watch the secondary TV while you unwind from a long business event or a crazy night on the strip.  The suite's bathroom was a memorable signature of PP. It's decorated with marbled walls and sink tops, stylish light designs, and a glass door shower, which make you wake up feeling like an executive. There's even a mini TV installed by the sink so that you don't miss a beat from a close sports game while taking a dump. For times when you want to entertain guests, there is a small jetted tub available behind the shower.   Because my check-in was delayed due to a computer reservation problem, the friendly front desk clerk issued me two free passes to Drift Spa. Admission is typically $15 for hotel guests. The facilities were spotless and once I entered the spa, I was greeted by professional maintainers who handed me tomato juice and showed me around the facilities. I noticed that the spa is compact but still featured the usual sauna, relax lounge, and steam rooms. The standout was their hammam, a large Turkish co-ed steam bath with elegant lighting. This was the most relaxing feature of the spa. I released a week's worth of tension and negative energy in that room. I was however not a fan of the spa' opening hours, 6am to 7pm. Closing at 7pm made it difficult to enjoy the facilities since my business events typically ended at 6pm.   The Palms Casino and dining options at this hotel are not as highly rated as the options available on the strip. With exception to Earl of Sandwich by the casino, I don't see any reason why I would spend money at the hotel restaurants.   Although the amenities and value of Palms Place are unbeatable for a hotel off the strip, the main limitation is the hotel's location. Being off the strip is a factor that could turn away prospective visitors from booking this hotel. Just as a warning, from your room, you have to cross the skybridge to get to Palms Casino (5 to 10 minutes) and then walk ~20 minutes or drive/cab 5 to 10 minutes to get to the strip. This might not be convenient for people spending a significant amount of time on the strip. However, if you have a rental car, won't be going to the strip too often, or are only in Vegas for business, then I cannot think of a more ideal place to stay off the strip besides Palms Place.

APDC is probably the most iconic restaurant in Montreal. It's a contemporary Quebecois restaurant, not French, but considered Quebecois or French-Canadian. The cuisine is extraordinary rich and heavy, perfect for carnivores, and fit as comfort food during cold weather. I couldn't have dined in at a more appropriate time, a day when it was snowing in Montreal during May.  A long time customer who I sat next to at the bar told me that the menu got condensed over the years. He said that the food is still solid and decadent though.  Sunday is probably the worst day to dine at APDC. It's the end of their week, so many items were sold out. The server named a few special items but was unable to translate it to English so I skipped them. Since the restaurant is known for cooking every single part of a pig, I ordered the "Happy Pork Chop". The next item on the menu "PDC cut" is basically a double portion for 2 people (over 1 pound of pork). I also ordered the signature cromesquis de foie gras as an appetizer.  The cromesquis was like a pork-based croquette molded into a cube. It looked harmless on the outside, but it's lethal inside. The interior, filled with foie gras in creamy and runny form, explodes once the crust penetrates, so be sure to consume it one bite!  The roasted pork chop was crispy on the outside but slightly on the dry side. The meat was tender and tasted great with the caramelized onion, button mushroom, and sweet bergundy mushroom gravy. The gravy was full bodied and the dish was very filling.  Since I didn't order any large appetizers, I was able to save room for a dessert. I had the pouding chomeur a l'erable, a very classical Quebecois sweet consisting of hot crusty bread pudding drowned with housemade maple syrup. The thick maple syrup was very sweet but served warm and extremely comforting to eat. It was the perfect way to end the meal on a cold night.  Being from California, I honestly don't think I would have a craving for the Quebecois food served at APDC. But since the mood and weather was a perfect fit during my visit, I had a terrific 4-star experience.  A few tips: 1. Make a reservation by email: reservations@restaurantaupieddecochon.ca The restaurant somehow lost my reservation and was about to turn me away, but fortunately I pulled up my reservation confirmed by email and they let me in.  2. Best seat is at the counter, not the bar, they're way different. The most you'll see at the bar is a server cleaning glasses.  3. The restaurant is loud and cozy. 50% local, 50% tourists during my time of visit.

Giant Coffee does not have the vibrant name expected of a premiere coffee shop like Lux or Cartel Coffee Lab. But don't let that deter you from going. I came to Phoenix for a one-week business trip and had the opportunity to sample coffee in the downtown Phoenix area. Most of the coffee shops were somewhat homogeneous, but Giant stood out as my favorite.  Out of all the coffee shops I tried, Giant was the only one that served both espresso beverages and pourover coffee. Pourovers are extremely popular in LA but not so much in Phoenix. In Phoenix, the menus are typically limited to espresso variations (macchiato, cappucchino, mocha) prepared on a La Marzocco machine. Unlike what its name suggests, the coffee at Giant are not enormous like the counterparts found at Starbucks. The largest size served at Giant is 12oz.   Giant sources its beans from Four Barrel and offers organic Straus milk, products which are from the Bay Area in California. I appreciate Giant's attention to detail. Straus barista milk specifically compatible for coffee is used. This milk is richer, sweeter, and creamier than the ordinary milk available at chain shops.  Breakfast is one aspect that Giant Coffee fares better than LA coffee shops. Breakfast in LA is usually limited to simple pastries. However at Giant, oven baked eggs, proscuitto, and levian toast are available for $8. In LA, this type of food can be found at diners but not at boutique coffee shops. The difference is that at Giant, I could eat a delicious full breakfast AND sip on a cup of crafted coffee before work. At LA, I would have to choose one or the other.   During my next visit to Phoenix, I will be sure to stop by at Giant. The environment was comfortable, the beverages were carefully-crafted with premium beans and milk, and prices were slightly lower than those at local coffee shops.

Nobuo at Teeter House was my first meal in Phoenix. I was directed to this restaurant from reviews rating it as "5-star cuisine". After all, the owner Nobuo Fukada from Tokyo received the acclaimed James Beard Award in 2007.   When I arrived at exactly 5pm, the servers were probably amused to see me. The restaurant was completely empty. As I walked in, several servers were just arriving on their shift! Without hesitation, they seated me in a private wood-floored historic bungalow room and presented a two page tapa menu.  The servers were polite. I did not encounter anyone Japanese in the restaurant, with the exception of chef Nobuo Fukada. Apparently, Nobuo is not a traditional Japanese restaurant. It is an izakaya-style eatery with heavy American influences in the dishes (think creative east-meets-west Japanese). The dinner menu consisted of 4 appetizers, 8 cold dishes, and 9 warm dishes with prices ranging from $6 to $26.  Due to the high cost of each dish, I was only able to order 2 tapas. I selected the two most popular dishes:  1. GRAPEFRUIT AND HAMACHI ($16) This cold dish consists of 4 thick slices of hamachi (albacore) sashimi gently brushed with white truffle ponzu oil. A thin slice of ginger was applied on top. Each piece of hamachi was wrapped with a slice of avocado and a piece of grapefruit. The citrus ingredients complemented the hamachi. They were served creatively on single-bit spoons.  2. WARM DUCK SALAD ($16) A duck salad sounds ordinary but it was prepared with precision that exceeded my standards. It was a hearty warm dish. About 5 to 6 slices of warm duck were served with a bed of grilled greens. The duck was lightly pan seared to create crispy edges. Then, a soy and zinfandei marinade reduction was applied to create a succulent flavor. Although the grilled vegetables can be dry, it can be dipped in the yuzu vinaigrette. This dish exhibited a satisfying variety of texture - crispy and juicy (duck), crunchy (grilled onions and peppers), chewy (grilled greens).  Although the dishes at Nobuo were artfully crafted, thoughtful, and prepared with superb seasonal ingredients, like most small plate restaurants, the overall value was borderline poor. Perhaps lunch is more appropriate here than dinner. My dinner exceeded $40 including tax and tip, but my stomach was not full after 2 tapas. After this meal, I had to drive to CherryBlossom in Phoenix for a second meal.  Try Nobuo if $$$$ or a budget is not an issue. Come with a large group of 4 to 6 and splurge on the various tapas.

Bacchanal is hands down the most outstanding buffet on the Vegas strip. In fact, it was the highlight of my recent Vegas trip.  At Bacchanal, you will find the following stations: Mexican, Italian, Chinese/Vietnamese, Japanese, American/carvery, seafood, pizza, deli and dessert. I like Bacchanal because the food is fresh, made-to-order right in front of your eyes. Most of the dishes are prepared in small plates, so you won't feel like you ate too much. The trend of using small plates at buffets is thoughtful since it reduces the amount of potentially unfinished food.   If you are a fan of boiled Alaska king crab legs, mussel, oyster shooters, or ceviche, then you belong here. Imagine yourself walking up to the seafood section, handing over your plate, and walking back to your table with a plate stacked with crab legs - unlimited amount of times. Note that Bacchanal is one of the few Vegas buffets that still carries crab legs (probably due to budget cuts).  The Chinese section at Vegas buffets is typically avoided by Asians, but probably not here. I found the congee and juicy char siu to be very delicious at Bacchanal and worthy of sampling. In fact, the char siu was very popular, so be sure to grab a few pieces. Basic nigiri (tuna and salmon) was available in small quantities. The fish was fresh. Don't expect thick cuts or sauces - just fish and rice. There was also a black chicken soup at the Asian station that I recommend if you are looking for a very light hearty Chinese soup.   Skip the Mexican station. Why eat oily tacos and quesadillas when you can save room in your stomach for the seafood and the tender prime rib or brisket at the carvery? Go get your money's worth!  Pace yourself and save room for the fancy desserts. Or feel free to eat desserts first. The dessert selection is phenomenal. You will find an island full of cakes, tarts, flan, cupcakes, all prepared with extraordinary culinary sophistication. The desserts at Bacchanal are far superior to the other Vegas-strip buffets, in terms of variety, creativity, and quality.   Notes: 1. The menu on the cover image is outdated. Weekend dinner (Fri-Sat-Sun) is now $50.99 ($55 including tax) and weekday dinner (M-Th) is $44.99.  2. Be prepared for a long wait. Don't come if you are an impatient person. Sunday dinner at 8pm sounded like a time when most people left Vegas already, but at that hour, I was still met with a 60 minute wait. There was still a line at 9:30pm.  3. Once you get into the buffet, you may have to wait in line again for food. The longest line was for the boiled crab legs (~20 minute wait). The second longest line was the carvery (~10 minute wait). Fortunately, you won't encounter lines for anything other than the meat and seafood. 4. Pace yourself. Save room for the desserts. Wear loose clothing before coming. 5. Soft drinks are complimentary. Alcoholic beverages are not included in the buffet cost. 6. Purchase the Buffet of Buffets 24 hour pass ($49.99) if you intend to try other buffets after Bacchanal. 7. I ate at the Wynn Buffet the next day, and without a doubt, Bacchanal was 5x more impressive than the Wynn.

I tried Umiya during my recent visit to Vegas since it was close to my hotel. The restaurant is about a mile off the strip, across the street from Palms Place.  Upon entering, the sushi chefs shout out 'Hello' and 'Welcome' greetings in Korean. In the background, there are TVs with PSY music videos playing on repeat (Gangnam style and Gentleman). Kind of strange to be in a Korean environment while eating Japanese sushi, but if you focus on the food, the awkwardness can be filtered out.  Umiya carries a similar menu to other Vegas AYCE sushi restaurants. For example, tuna, albacore, super white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, halibut, red snapper, shrimp, eel, mackerel, etc are on the sushi list. However, Umiya distinguishes itself from the pack by offering premium sushi. There are 3 daily specials of high quality fish. During my visit, they were spanish mackerel, giant clam, and striped bass. Sometimes, the specials may include sea bream and giant scallop. These varieties are rarely found in common AYCE sushi lists. On top of that, there were oysters, uni, and ama-ebi. All of the premium and special items have a limit of 1 order, but it was not really enforced since order forms and records were not used.   The oysters, uni, spanish mackerel, and halibut were my favorites. The quality and freshness of the fish were invariably excellent. Fish were cut thick, characteristic of the Korean preference. Unfortunately, the presentation was sometimes poor. Sauces were overapplied to the fish at times, resulting in sauce overflowing onto the plate and rice. A carefully-crafted piece of nigiri should not have ponzu or soy sauce staining the rice before it reaches the consumer. This is a common occurrence in Korean sushi restaurants.  Organization was another issue that I encountered. Umiya did not utilize order forms at the bar. Each customer is expected to order in front of a chef. Unfortunately, the chefs could not handle large orders. I tried making 10 orders at once but he was overwhelmed and could only remember 4 to 6 at a time. When the restaurant filled up halfway during our meal, I was neglected for over 30 minutes in favor of the new diners. An order form might be useful for Umiya to implement in the future.  Aside from the aforementioned issues, Umiya is still phenomenal for the price. $25 for unlimited decent seafood with premium options is an exceptional deal. This is perfect for those who are hungry, seeking a budget sushi restaurant in Vegas, and can sacrifice a little bit of quality. I am already anticipating a visit to Umiya during my next visit to Vegas.

The most craptastic AYCE sushi I've ever had.  No wasabi dabbed in between the fish and rice. The supplied wasabi was in the form of a rigid block, dried out, and possibly stale. Even worse than the wasabi served at revolving sushi bars.  There was too much rice in the nigiri that created an imbalance in the flavors of fish and rice. I like sushi rice, but that's all I tasted in the nigiri, no matter what type of thin sliver of fish was slapped on top of the rice.  Really awful salmon and tuna, each piece had a firm and chewy flesh. Somewhat similar quality to the frozen fish served at Chinese buffets, they all lacked moisture. The yellowtail and white tuna were a little better and were the only fish worth repeating.  It was my first time being served warm mackerel from a sushi bar. Maybe it was cooked or toasted together with eel. Aside from having an odd slimy texture, the mackerel was flavorless for this type of fish.   The spicy yellowtail handroll was as dry as the Arizona desert. The ingredients wrapped inside the nori were salty and rough, and reminded me of eating dried shrimp.  Either the sushi chefs were uninformed or being cheap. They served a piece of kale with sashimi, and added a sliver of nori in between the ika and sushi rice. Have they ever eaten these with shiso leaf before? That would be a better choice of ingredient in my opinion.  To sum up my experience, the meal was a waste of calories.

I have only eaten Moroccan food once or twice before. But after dining at Moroccan Paradise across from ASU, I liked it so much that I decided to try another Moroccan restaurant the following day. That's when I discovered Couscous Express, which I read is famous for their couscous and date shakes.  When I entered Couscous Express, I was personally greeted by owner-chef Abdul who hails from Tangier, Morocco. Even before shown the menu, he had dropped off a few complimentary starters - a warm cup of bitter gunpowder tea, a bowl of mildly spiced hisara soup that was lentil based, and a microwaved piece of harsha that's like a thick disc shaped pan fried bread. Abdul told me to take my time, he would take my order after I finished the appetizers. I have eaten at Arabic restaurants where a hearty lentil soup is the first item served, and the hisara soup tasted very similar to that. It's like the "miso soup" of Middle Eastern meals.   The menu was very simplistic, permutations of either kabobs or tagine, with the choice of vegetable, chicken, beef, fish, or lamb. For that reason, there was no paper menu passed out. Just tell Abdul what you want. I chose the lamb tagine, after having had chicken the previous night.  The tagine was essentially an individual serving potted stew, very soupy, containing a melange of boiled vegetables, raisins (instead of dates), and meat. I ate it with steamed couscous which was prepared reasonably well - very moist and soft, somewhat fragrant, a hint of raisin-like sweetness. The couscous was not as spongy as rice that I eat more frequently, but it did taste good with the hearty low-sodium broth. I especially liked the broth because it had natural sweetness from the boiled vegetables. The broth was light but still relatively savory, it tasted great even on its own.  Unfortunately, I was extremely let down by one aspect. I ordered lamb but I'm convinced that I received beef, although one of the servers assured me it was lamb. I don't think it was goat meat either. The lamb tasted really similar to the boiled beef stock that I add to my Chinese soup. No gamey flavor, tough resilient texture, very lean meat. It was my least favorite aspect of the tagine. In my opinion, using lamb or goat shanks (bone-in) would make the tagine taste infinitely better.  Nonetheless, I had a positive experience at Couscous Express. Hospitality was the most memorable aspect of the meal. Chef Abdul treats customers like family, and dining in felt like being a guest in his house. It's a one man show in the kitchen but he somehow finds time to bus tables. Chef Abdul even refilled my broth and bowl of couscous without asking. It's impossible to leave hungry from this place.  Between Couscous Express and Moroccan Paradise, I would pick Couscous Express if I wanted a more soupy and stew-like tagine, and choose Moroccan Paradise if I were craving for a more of a purely steamed bowl where a gravy is served on the side.

Not sure what makes their food Sinaloa style (maybe the unique set of spices for the chicken), the menu appeared to be border-style street food with a wholesome and contemporary twist. Everything I ordered at Kiss Pollos was very flavorful and the ingredients were remarkably fresh.  This is not a typical dollar taco shop, they specialize in chicken and potatoes prepared in unorthodox ways. For example, there are eclectic items on the menu such the salad taco, mini pizza made with tortillas, nacho-infused chicken tacos.  I came to try a salad taco and their famous kiss chicken taco, both of which cost a little more than $1. The salad taco consisted of a potato salad ball and some leafy greens wrapped in a supple flour tortilla. The cold potato salad was savory and surprisingly not too heavy. It did have a slightly acquired taste initially, so it was very different but in a positive and creative way. I preferred the chicken taco a little more, because the chicken was thoroughly roasted over charcoal and had profound chargrilled flavor. I'm a fan of the bitter-smoky flavors (not overdone) in the chicken, I thought that it was expertly prepared.  For both tacos, flour tortillas were used rather than corn tortillas. Kiss Pollo's flour tortillas tasted like they were homemade with greater thickness, durability, and elastic texture compared to the fragile store-bought tortillas commonly served at dollar taco stands.  The most attractive feature at Kiss Pollo was their salsa bar. Every single item there was fresh and neatly presented. The salsas and vegetables looked like they were prepared just an hour ago. There were more condiments to dress up the tacos compared to most salsa bars I've seen in California. For example, I found pickled red onions, Mexican cheese, and cucumbers.  I don't mind coming back for some grilled chicken tacos when I visit Phoenix again!

Out of all the coffee shops I visited this week in Phoenix, Futuro was my favorite. It was one of the few places in Phoenix that offered a similar experience to the trendy third wave coffee shops in LA. I thought that Giant Coffee and Cartel Coffee Lab were OK, but not in the same league as Futuro.  What makes this place special is ex-Cartel and ex-Giant barista Bill's pursuit of the perfect cup of coffee. His vision is to improve the coffee scene in Phoenix, which in my opinion is dreadful compared to the ones in Seattle and LA. Lola and Lux Central were highly recommended to me but they were more hype than substance. I can tell that Bill idolizes the baristas from G&B/GGET in LA, he's followed them since the Sqirl pop-up. It might explain why he sources beans from 49th Parallel, particularly the Honduras Ocotillo that was used by Charles Babinski in the 2015 WBC.  The menu at Futuro is simple for now, primarily espresso-based drinks or cold brew (no pourovers), although Bill can probably customize any drink you want if you're nice. He pulls excellent shots (49th Parallel Epic) on the La Marzoco Linea, uses high quality milk (not cheap supermarket jugs), and draws the most consistent latte art in town. For non-coffee drinkers, he can make a cascara tea (made with skin and pulp of dried coffee cherries, tastes like a white tea).   No, Bill doesn't make his own almond macadamia milk like at GGET or exquisite hoppy teas like at G&B (just yet), but he did let me try a cascara tea with a splash of sparkling water that was a simple yet refreshing elixir. You probably won't find it anywhere else in Arizona.   Part of the coffee shop experience to me is interaction with the barista that makes my drink. An ideal barista is one who is friendly, shares the passion of coffee to customers, gets to know customers, understands what the customers like, etc. It's sharing a brief moment in the day together while the barista makes the drink. The experience should be totally the opposite of that at Starbucks, where people can order on their phone and pick up their drink at the counter without encountering the barista. Bill provides personable barista service and he's open to feedback, exactly like how it is at places like G&B and GGET.  Futuro is a great concept and I hope more people in the DT Phoenix area can come check it out. It's way way better than Lux or Lola nearby.
