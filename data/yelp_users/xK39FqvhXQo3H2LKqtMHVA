Not a huge fan of this place, although the barber did give me a proper fade. I would have to say its over priced for mens cuts and way to long of a wait.... its not a super cuts and its not a high class salon either so in my eyes it is very useless

This place is fantastic!!! I love there green salsa!! they are so great as a matter of fact that my wife and i had them cater our wedding reception. I recommend this to anyone in the mesa area. From the Tia burrito to the enchiladas you cant go wrong!!!!
