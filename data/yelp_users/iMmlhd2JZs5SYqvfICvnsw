Not the best hotel, but also not the worst to stay at for the price. It was one of the cheaper hotels due to the convention that was going on. It served its purpose, but was a little annoying due to the noise people made. Upon arriving to the room, I found a bunch of hair on the bathroom floor. Gross. Otherwise, everything else was clean. Wouldn't stay here again unless I really had to because it's away from the strip.

I was a little hesitant to try this place out due to the mixed reviews. I was starving and this place is located inside the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino. Parking was not a problem, but that might be because I'm here on a Monday! I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service so I'm glad we ended up giving it a chance. We were seated right away and the carts came by pretty often. The food was hot and fresh. I actually thought the dim sum was decent and they had a great selection to choose from. Our water was refilled frequently and a food server made her round to ask every table if everything was okay. Although I've been spoiled with dim sum in LA county and OC, it certainly satisfied the dim sum craving. The best thing about it next to service is the pricing!

This place definitely lives up to the hype! Warning: DO NOT GO HERE EXTREMELY HUNGRY! The wait can be quite long. I came here on a Wednesday night and the wait time was still about 1 1/2+ hours. We opted to get the jambalaya level 6 and combo pan roast with sausage level 7. After ordering, it takes about 15 - 30 additional minutes to prepare and serve. The wait was worth it. Everything about the dishes were perfect! They don't skimp on the seafood or food in general. Delicious and cooked perfectly! A must try when you're in Vegas. Don't go in groups.

*REVIEW FOR THE LARGE MACARONS ONLY*  I was thoroughly disappointed after hearing such rave reviews about their macarons. The flavor is seriously lacking and it just wasn't up to par with what I've tried at other bakeries before. I bought the pre-packaged box with 6 macarons in it. The coffee/mocha flavored one was in-your-face strong and the chocolate is pretty decadent. The raspberry has a subtle flavor. I think the best one out of the box was the vanilla bean one. The caramel didn't taste like caramel and the pistachio one kind of had a soapy taste to it. Time to try my hand at making some myself!

First off, you get what you pay for. I was actually surprised by how good the soondubu turned out to be! The workers are very friendly. I ordered a Medium Spicy Combination Soondubu while the beau ordered a Medium Spicy Beef Soondubu. Although it doesn't beat Kaju in California, it comes close! The banchan offerings were a little sad, womp womp. The soondubu, though flavorful, just wasn't the same. It just had less things going on so it was more watery than what you're served at other restaurants with soondubu. I appreciated the fact that the shrimp in my soondubu was a good sized one, not the tiny sad things you'd find at Kaju. They also add the egg in for you and it's a pretty large egg...again, unlike the tiny one you'd find at Kaju! Their spiciness is definitely on the milder side, so if I were to get it again, I'd order spicy instead of medium. It was a nice find for brunch and certainly satisfied!

The plaza that this breakfast joint is located in consists of a bunch of car stores, lol. I was confused and thought we might've turned into the wrong plaza, but nope! Upon arrival, the door was opened for us by a friendly gentleman who also seated us. Menus are already on the table. Everyone here is extremely nice and attentive. We opted to order the Biscuits and Gravy with Hashbrowns, French toast (2), a Cinnamon Roll, and a side of Sausage Patties.  Biscuits and Gravy: One of the best I've had thus far. Different and delicious! It was perfectly seasoned. Since the gravy is prepared differently, the waitress asked us if we'd like to try a sample of the gravy first before committing to the dish, but I was already set on getting this dish and needless to say, I was really glad I ordered this! Most places overly salt the crap out of the biscuits AND the gravy, but not here! You won't be disappointed!  Hashbrowns: Perfectly cooked and seasoned. I don't know how to describe the exact seasoning, but it's not just S&P. It's surprisingly good! Crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside without being mushy. Mmmmm, more please!  French Toast: Standard, but still satisfying. It's hard to make French toast really stand out unless you get fancy with flavors.  Sausage Patties: Great flavor and cooked well! I hate places that cook the freakin' meat out of the damn patty to where it is hard and dry!  Cinnamon Roll: By far the most disappointing thing ever! It did not taste like a cinnamon roll...plus the icing was all powdered sugar. I prefer the cream cheese based icing for cinnamon rolls, or if you're just going to go with the powder sugar icing, at least flavor it in some way so it tastes more than just wet powdered sugar. Yuck. I feel like the Pillsbury crap is better and tastes more like a cinnamon roll. I wouldn't buy this ever ever ever again.  A must try for a hearty American breakfast if you're in that kind of mood!

This hotel is awesome! It's gorgeous inside! The elevators are confusing. The first set you go to takes you to the lobby (23rd floor). Then you have to make a left out the elevator and take a second one to your hotel floor. I love that it's casino and smoke-free. By far the most peaceful feeling hotel on the strip! We just parked at Aria's self-parking structure and walked over.

I was so heartbroken that Yelpers let me down yet again! Okay, that was a bit dramatic, but the whole experience was odd from start to finish! First off, we unlocked the offer for free egg rolls which never came out. We had to remind the guy mid experience and didn't get it until after we had finished our meal. Upon being seated, we were offered the menu, but the server seemed so confused all the time. Every time someone would want to order something, he'd have to go check about something with the dish. It was really weird! He also tried schooling me on what kind of noodle dishes were what and the herbs to eat with it. Honey, I'm Vietnamese. I know what to eat with my food and what's supposed to be in the dishes. I guess my proper pronunciation of everything didn't give my ethnicity away? It was just an awkward vibe all around. I ended up with Bun Bo Hue, which they no longer serve with the pork blood cubes! Womp womp. I was really looking forward to that. My beau ordered the Pho Tai with Bo Vien (meatballs). The Bun Bo Hue was flavorful, spicy, and definitely hit the spot. It was a generous portion and had a lot of meat. The pho, however, was NOT pho! I don't know if it was an off day or something or people on here just don't know what good pho tastes like, but what my beau had to eat tasted nothing like what I grew up on. That was extremely disappointing since this place had such great reviews for their pho. Oh well, onto the next establishment!

First off, I wasn't expecting much due to the price we paid for the rooms. We just needed a place to sleep so we wouldn't be in the room much anyway. That's why we had settled on this place. You definitely get what you pay for (which isn't much). No room service, no amenities, no housekeeping unless you pay extra, etc...They do have a complimentary 'breakfast' bar where you can grab some oatmeal, coffee, and stuff downstairs.  I had the most frustrating conversation with an incompetent front desk worker over the phone the night before my stay. For the life of me, I could not put my question into simpler terms for her to understand. She kept telling me to call back tomorrow morning because she couldn't change anything in the system when I wasn't even asking her to change anything! Luckily, I called hotels.com (where I booked the hotel from originally) and they were able to answer my question.  Upon arrival, one of the two rooms smelled like smoke even though it's supposed to be a non-smoking room. I guess my sister didn't want to fuss about it so she slept in that room and dealt with the smell. I took the other room, which didn't smell. It does seem a bit dingy though. The mattress is a bit hard, but not uncomfortably so. The sheets and blankets should probably be updated because they are stained. Made me thankful that I brought my own pillow and blanket with me since I drove from CA. There wasn't any problem otherwise. It was quiet. I checked underneath the beds on the last day to make sure we didn't leave anything behind and apparently they don't clean under there...or at all really? I don't know. I found a bunch of things underneath both beds like a toddler's shoe, a BIC lighter, napkins, etc. Kind of makes you wonder what they DO clean. Anyway, lesson learned. Never again.
