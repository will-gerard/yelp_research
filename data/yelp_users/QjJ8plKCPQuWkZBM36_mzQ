I usually do my own nails (I'm a nail tech) and thought I'd treat myself. I had the guy do my nails. It was the WORST set ever. He nicked me twice, I had to reshape and file them even in front of him, he did not reenforce the nicks and when I got home two broke off. One is cracked , my hair gets caught in them and I'm seriously thinking about demanding my money back. He started to polish and it was so horrible I told him to take it off and I'd do it myself at home. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.  Yes they offer water, bfd. They SUCK!!  They do NOT deserve even one star but I couldn't move on without adding one. They are minus zero stars.  So I went back to show them the disaster they did on my nails and asked for a refund.  They refused.  BIG surprise.  I was going to call the police, but I did one better.  I called State Board.  I have submitted a formal complaint and me, being a nail tech., know they take this stuff seriously.  I am looking forward to getting my refund.  they refused to even call the manager and the nick I got on my cuticle was apparently 'my fault.'    Karma will be visiting them very soon.

Went here for our first time last week and it was amazing. I highly recommend it.  The Roman bread is to die for.  I could have had the rest of the meal to go.  We will be going back soon.

Had and excellent dinner here this evening. Everyone was very happy with their meal. It was our first time to eat here and definitely not the last. Nice to have an Italian restaurant right on the trail in AJ. Their food portions are huge. You will be taking some leftovers home. Then for dessert we had the chocolate mousse cake (the best ever) and the strawberry swirl cheesecake. Amazing!!!!

This is an amazing place.  I have not had a chocolate malt as good as this since I was a kid.  We had to wait a little longer than usual (or so they thought) and brought us a coupon for our next visit.  Then we went back and we wanted to switch the coupon for something else, but they couldn't do it.  So we order malts again, just one.  We had to wait again and one of the boys came out and said we made an extra by mistake, do you want it?  Duh of course.  So we got two for the price of one.  Most excellent.  LOVE this place.

A fairly good place to go. I like that they do all services. Waxing, facials, hair. I'm used to the instructors having a little bit more influence and interaction. They came at the beginning of the service and the end. They just wear street clothes and were pretty loud amongst themselves. Not really like the school I went to.

Good place for a great burger. Didn't have to wait this time it was late. Guy did a good job upwelling additional items. LOL

Mmmm Good (and I'm not talking soup)  My first time to Rubio's was awesome.  The girl at the counter was very helpful and knowledgable. She gave some great suggestions and boy were they ever right.  I LOVED the Tilapia fish taco.  Somehow before I tried it the words 'fish' and 'taco' just never seemed to go together.  Now that I've had it, I'm still not sure.  Thanks for a great experience.  I may try some more at another time.

Charlie came yesterday for the first time.  He was amazing.  I learned things about scorpions and ants that I didn't know I needed to know.  Very conscientious and customer orientated, explained everything he did and why. Grateful to our landlord who chose this company.  And we have dogs and this is safe for pets after it dries.  We will always use this service wherever we are in the valley.  Thanks Charlie, you and your brother have an amazing business.

Went in on a referral from a friend and after looking for a place for nearly 4 years, I can say I finally found a place that does nails like I would.  Antoine is amazing and everything was so clean and nice.  I got a full set and I was in and out in about 47 min.  And the great thing is we are moving just a block away.  Good to make an appointment, but I think they take walk ins.
