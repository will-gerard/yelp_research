Speaking as the current "duke" of this place, I have been here many times at all different times. The free buffet on Fridays is awesome because there is nothing like eating Italian food while watching topless girls. They always have the best line-up but I just wish the were open past 2 and fondled my balls more

I have been to Eddie's House twice now. The first time I went in just to check it out and sat at the bar. Luckily they had happy hour going all night so I ordered two appetizers for myself which were the lamb chops and smoked calamari. The lamb chops were excellent and highly recommended. The smoked calamari was different but I wouldn't order it again because the smoked flavor almost tasted like a hot dog to me but the spice was good.  My second time I went for a friends birthday and someone at the table ordered the chicken lollipops as an appetizer and they were bigger than we expected so a couple people ordered them as an entr√©e. I ordered the roasted chicken with creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes which was forgotten about so everyone was finished with their dinners before I got mine. Even though I had to wait it was still delicious with a crispy skin with a moist inside. It also had a cream sauce that I soaked up with my chicken. The server did buy me a drink for the mess up and she also got us a free birthday dessert. I will be back

Good beer and atmosphere, hit or miss on the food, and terrible service. I've been many times at night for drinking and that's the only thing it's good for after some bad experiences when trying to dine there.  First time I went on my lunch break on a Thursday and we got seated and ordered beers right away and then the server said she would be right back to take our food order. About 20 minutes later she came by and said our food is just about to come out which was shocking because she didn't even take our order yet. She apologized and said she forgot about us. I had the chicken panini which was a great lunch choice except it took another 30 minutes to cook plus we had to track down our server to pay so I was late back to work.   My second dining experience I went on a Tuesday night because they were one of the only places still serving food besides pizzerias. I ordered the Breakfast Burrito right once I sat down so the same thing wouldn't happen again. My friend met up with me 15 minutes later and ordered the chicken panini which only took 20 minutes this time but it still came out before my food which I was waiting for 35 minutes at this point so I asked the server and she went to check on it. She came back and said "the kitchen must have lost the ticket or something but it will be right out". 20 minutes later it finally came and it was the worst Breakfast Burrito that I have ever eaten in my life. You would expect a $12 burrito would be pretty epic but everything about it was terrible. First they used a Spinach Wrap which was thick and doesn't pair well for a Breakfast burrito because it tasted too much like veggies. Second their "Italian sausage" tasted like ground up salami which was also nasty. After an hour of waiting for a terrible expensive breakfast burrito and no management came by to check on us or apologize I have learned to never eat at this place again.
