I would say this is the Scottsdale version of Egg Harbor.  I swear they even bought their benches and chairs from the same manufacturer.  I digress.  The food was good, not great, and really nothing special or out of the ordinary.  It was delivered to our table hot and quickly,  two very important components.  The portions were not overwhelming or too large to finish.  It is family friendly and there was no wait on any of the mornings we ate there.  It worked out well on our journey to the airport.

I found this resort to be just wonderful. Our room was very large, but unfortunately there was only one chair, besides the desk chair, on which to sit. That was the only negative, aside from the extremely rude, LOUD guests that walked the halls. Not the resort's fault that some guests have no manners.   The grounds were lovely, the fountain out in front often had birds drinking, and the trees lit up at night were beautiful.   Everything was convenient, i.e. shops, highways, restaurants. The pool and hot tub were refreshing.   Sangrias has a great happy hour.   Our room looked out onto the golf course.   People that have complained about the size of the bathrooms have, obviously, never been to New York. The outer dressing area with sink worked very well so that two people could get ready simultaneously.   The wedding we attended was held in an area that we had not previously explored. Loved the fountains.   I would definitely return if in the area.

I think there are enough reviews for everyone who has not been here to figure out what a great restaurant this really is. This was a recommendation from a fellow yelper, and I am eternally grateful.   I might suggest changing the name to House of Treats which is exactly what happened to my palette with each bite I took.   The flavors and combinations were unique and delicious. Everything that everyone in our party ordered was devoured and thoroughly enjoyed. A fine dining experience. I have never had the opportunity to try ricotta black peppercorn grits ~ YUMMY.   I would love to return on a night when outdoor seating might be more completely enjoyed.   The only negative is the REALLY small size of the available indoor seating area. It could not accommodate a group larger than 5 people.

I totally enjoyed my visit to this ball park.   Parking was easy ~ have you been to a Chicago baseball game?   The park was clean, the people were friendly, and there were no lines for the ladies room.   With the roof closed, a necessity on this particular evening, it did feel dark. However, that did not have a negative impact on my review. It appears that there is not a bad seat to be had. Have you thought about having known people lead the 7th inning stretch singing?  Ironically, the very first beer vendor that came our way happened to have grown up in the same small suburb of Chicago that I did.  What a riot.

We stopped in for something light before heading to the ballgame.  (Gotta have room for a hot dog at the ball park).  We split the club sandwich and it was just right.    Service was attentive and the retro decor was welcoming and comfortable.  Nice selection of wines.  I would definitely return if the opportunity came up.

Our visit sounded more like a visit to the Emergency Room.  There was plenty of sneezing, wheezing, itching, and overall difficulty breathing.  The cause:  a clueless couple and their hairy cat.  A supervisor was called and we were told that we could leave the area but that a paying customer would not be asked to leave even if their cat was having a negative impact on other guests and employees.  Pets are allowed.  Personally, If I knew that I had an item that was causing that much distress, I would leave but I am of a different generation and it is not always about me.  So United ~ if I could give you negative stars, to risk the well being of that many people, I would.
