I've been going to this Visionworks for the last couple of years, only because of the convenience of proximity to my home. The customer service is hit or miss: if you have the bad luck of working with Doris (the rude red-headed old bat previously mentioned) prepare to receive atrocious customer service. She is condescending, impatient, and apathetic at best. If you're lucky enough to work with anyone else, you should be fine, be will still likely leave with overpriced frames, lenses, or contacts. After my last awful interaction with Doris (keep in mind I've had a couple over the past few years), I will now be taking my business elsewhere. I definitely recommend saving yourself the headache and finding another provider.

My one year-old son has seen two different peds so far because we choose to attachment parent, and both docs gave us misinformation that as first time parents, we didn't know to question. For instance, supplementing formula while I waited for my milk to come in (my son was well within the normal weight loss two weeks after birth), or allowing our son to "cry it out" when we didn't have issues with him sleeping, other than the fact they he nurses to fall asleep (which the doc had a problem with; I did not). At our first appointment with Dr. Aaron, we told him what we were looking for in our son's physician, and he was supportive, and helped us feel at ease. He even shared that his family coslept also, which was encouraging.   I'm so excited to have finally found a doc that gives us all sides, but allows us to make our own decisions without pressure or judgment; true informed consent. I wanted to find a doctor my son (& future kids) can grow up with, and I'm confident I found that with Dr. Aaron at East Valley Children's Group.

I've been coming here for the last 4 years, since they opened. What keeps me coming back is the outstanding coffee AND outstanding service. These guys not only remember my complicated drink order, but my kids' names. When I'm having a tough day, they treat me so kindly, I always leave with a smile on my face. Love these guys and their coffee!
