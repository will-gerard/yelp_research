Small plate with so few food on it. And plus, they gave me a cheap to go cup for my drink saying they ran out of clean cups, while giving the table with a bunch of frat guys next to me regular cups. What the heck???? Really discriminative. Never ever go there again.

If I can give 0 star I would! I've been here for 10+ times within the last year just to fix my crappy Chevy car's over heating problem, every time they come up with something new and every time the problem got worse. Even within warranty they asked for $130 just to check what's wrong! Without any fixing! And within this 10+ times, one time ON THE DAY I picked up my car the AC stopped working and I went right back, they asked $400 for replacing AC parts saying not their mistake. One time ON THE DAY I picked up my car it vibrates when I stop for right lights and stop on me. One time ON THE DAY I picked up my car the seat belt light lights up... Sometimes I really wonder if they are really fixing problems or causing problems so you have to go back for more services.   I'm done with Chevy and seriously I will not touch another one. I would never go back to this problem causing place ever again.  No I would not recommend this place nor a Chevy.

Should have listened to all the reviews up here... It's so surprising that even after the whole process, there are still dirty spots here and there, even a layer of dirt over my back seat door. Are the towels they use on my car dirty??? And what I hate the most, is that my windshield has all those marks left from wiping chemicals on it, see attached picture. And they can't be wiped off using tissue papers and stuff! I have to get something from Walmart to get those off

I used to go to the f.y.e. in Tempe a lot for some cheap used CD blu-ray and some electronics. They closed recently so I had to travel far here. The girl cashier was really nice. The speaker I was getting has old discount price tags on them (which should be taken down already), but she still gave me the discount. All in all it's a nice place for us poor students. I hope they stay strong in the digital age.

This is one of my favorites in Phoenix area. Wonderful waitress, nice service, and the food were just... make you want more after your very last bite. I noticed they change the menu a little bit sometimes? I love this dynamic vigor in their kitchen.

The guys and girls there are pretty friendly. I don't know her name but the girl who helped me was nice. I asked some dumb labeling question but she wasn't upset or inpatient like some other postal office worker would do. So thank you for the friendly help!

Honestly many other Chinese restaurants have much better food than this. Same dish better taste. And what makes it the worst Chinese restaurant is their super bad service. Always make customers wait EXTRA longer time, eat there or to go or delivery! A delivery takes 90+ minutes, and even asks customers to go find their car to get food, and they just sit there in the car without even getting out. What kind of DELIVERY is that???? Because my car broke down I thought okay I'll give them another try, but exactly the same thing happens again. After 3+ times I'm done. DO NOT order from them. And as a Chinese, I can assure you that other places have much better food.

How much can you save by giving your take out customer only half bowl of rice? Do you have to be this stingy on rice? I mean how expensive is it?!

This is a very nice little barbershop/salon. Adam is nice. On one hand I hope they have great business growing but on the other hand I selfishly wish that it won't be crowded as other barbershops that you have to wait a long time to get a haircut. So far the service is wonderful :) and they open relatively late which is a huge bonus, so I don't have to run like crazy just to get a haircut after work before they close. (again I selfishly wish they open till 9pm... I'm sorry I'm such a greedy person  lol)

Randy is really nice. He forgot I wanted 2 scoops instead of one, and just gave me the other scoop for free. And the ice cream is just wonderful! Yum! Thank you for giving my Saturday a wonderful ending.   Twilly dog is fun, good for snack. But I will try burgers next time.

Fast service (although maybe because I came in pretty late around 9pm) with short waiting time for food! Wonderful! :D Servers are nice and cute ;)   I had a solid meal here. What I like most is that they have entree+tofu soup combo! And you can choose whatever tofu soup they have! For an Asian, it starts to feel like meal when there's a main dish, some small cold dishes and a soup! Many other places don't have these options. If you want both then get both with full price. But here a small sized soup really makes a difference.   Even though it's a smaller size soup, the materials were solid. It doesn't feel like a cheap add-on side, but really a smaller version of the real thing. I had seafood tofu soup with egg, mussel, clams and a real size shrimp, not like some other Korean restaurant nowadays that use small shrimpies and substitute mussel with small clams even in a full price soup. The flavors are pretty good. I can't say it's the best or it's outstanding, but the attitude here is better than many.   I will come back and would recommend it to my friends.

I don't know if they just wanna talk me into coming here or something... I asked for 1.5 inch net pots on the phone and they said yea they have them! I drove 40mins here just to find out that they don't! And they said oh we only have 2 inch ones... It's just very unpleasant. I wish they understand their customers better.

This place is cute and cozy. Not a big restaurant but surely feels comfy. The food is surprisingly good. Especially the Takoyaki! Mmmm... I want some more :) Tried pork feet rice plate today and it was perfectly cooked, not too crunchy not too tender... I'm definitely coming back to try out some hot pot soon! Highly recommend.
