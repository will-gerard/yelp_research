As much as I would like to give these guys 5-stars, my recent experience just won't allow it. I took my Civic in because I was hearing excessive road noise and I was concerned. They did an oil change, replaced 2 tires, took my $250 and sent me on my way. Unfortunately none of this solved my road noise issue, so I was back the following Saturday. This time I was told I would need a new alternator, belt and tension - around $1000 parts & labor. I took it to another local shop for a second opinion and quote and I am so glad I did. Turns out it was a wheel bearing issue. I feel like a shop specializing in tires should have caught that, and maybe also told me about the CV axle that was throwing grease everywhere. My four tires are still under warranty at Tucker, and I still trust them to do oil changes - but anything else, get a second opinion.

I brought Willow the pug in for a self clean and nail trim. She wasn't a fan of being tethered to the tub and was pretty afraid of the dryer, but all that aside we had a successful bathing experience. Wash Wednesday is only $10 and we had her nails trimmed for an additional $3. Afterwards we picked out some treats $1-2 each and were assisted in picking out a toy (her new favorite - though it's already on a path to complete destruction). Their food prices are higher than some other local stores, and the average toy price is $10+ but the service was great and she even got a treat for being extra cute. I'll definitely be coming back.

I have done extensive research regarding nutrition for my pug and cats and NB has all the best brands (we love fromms and natural balance) at the best food prices in town. They can articulate the major differences in all the brands, and are happy to special order products for you. This is my go-to place for products and information.

I'm a bit of a sandwich addict. This place has the BEST tuna in town, hands down! Cheaper than Jimmy Johns, a bit more than Subway - but the fresh, locally sourced ingredients make up for it. It gets a little packed at lunch hour, so I recommend calling or faxing your order in first.   Try the #4 or #10! The potato salad is also amazing. I have not had a chance to make it in for breakfast, but I want to. A few times, I ended up going down the street to the second location because they ran out of bread (they are that good). The other location is a lot less busy and you might get hit on by one of the dudes there, but this one has Renee behind the register and she rocks (and also owns).

Dr. Natalie is absolutely great and will work closely with you to develop the right treatment plan to get you out of pain. This was my first experience with Chiropractic care, and I can't imagine it with anyone other than Dr. Natalie.

I bought my wedding under garments here and what became my favorite bra ever. They are the only ladies to go to regarding fitting! Victoria's Secret is that she lies to you about your size because she doesn't make it. Here they carry ALL the sizes!

This Denny's absolutely exceeded my expectations for service & quality! We had a pretty complicated breakfast order, but our server Ozlem was on-point so everything came out perfect. After some other questionable meals in Vegas - this was a welcomed comfort. We were pretty close to stopping back in and purchasing the coffee mug they had as a souvenir.

Just signed up and already to 3 strikes.  #1-Some creeper stared at me while I swam laps in the pool and clipped his nails for a full 30 minutes.  #2-Signed up for a trainer, showed up ready to go and found out they had "lost" my appointment. No one apologized, acted like it was my fault, and just rescheduled me.  #3-My husband reported that the men's toilet had pee all over it. Seriously, GROSS!  Since I made the financial commitment and really want pool and yoga access- I'm going to try another location out. My husband on the other hand is ready to cancel and go back to Gold's.
