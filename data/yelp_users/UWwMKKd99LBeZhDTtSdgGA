This place is so unassuming but it will punch you in the life with deliciousness! I just think about the biscuits and the gravy and the chicken! I have only gotten my food to go because we have several kids and it looks like a cool place for date night. The hours are hard to remember. But it's yum!

I only go here if it is an emergency. I HATE it that there is only one door to enter and exit. Is that for loss prevention? What about fire safety? I digress. The avocadoes are very cheap and good to eat. So that is worth it. They also only usually have ONE register open or 2 max. But there are several checkout lanes. The people in this neighborhood deserve better!!!!!

I have a thing for cozy, romatic nooks with those bistro lights and fireplaces. I am sure my husband would take me anywhere I want for our anniversary and for the last two years I have chosen Cibo. The first year we went, the owner was there and he offered us free limoncellos to celebrate. I think they do that for everyone but it felt special. You can dress up or go in jeans and it will work. It's smallish but there is room to have your own private conversation. Just be sure to try the nutella crepes!

Such a cute place! The employees are kind and friendly and the food is scrumptious! My daughter and I split the soup and salad lunch special and it was the best chicken caesar I have ever tasted. #cleanplateclub The chicken noodle soup was savory. Tastes homemade, but better!! Slurrrp!

This place used to be better. The people here look confused about how the computers/printers work. We got a new employee who was an hour late. Her excuse is that she is new. Most of the people in the waiting room seemed annoyed with the service.

I love this little place! We are here often because kids eat free on Sundays.(2 kids per adult!) The pizzas are so delicious. And they have a lunch special so if you get that you can really save money on some gourmet-tasting, brick oven pizza with thin, crispy crust! The sandwiches and salads are also simple and savory! Get you a drink at happy hour and Voila!

Yes on every level! I love the small, hipster vibe. I feel like this place is authentic in that regard even though it's becoming "so mainstream" to have a restaurant that is laid back. I love the bacon!It is my favorite bacon in Phoenix! I eat a TON of breakfast restaurants/takeout . It just depends on what you are looking for in a breakfast or brunch and mood. I am sure you will enjoy this rustic vibe. And did I say BACON?
