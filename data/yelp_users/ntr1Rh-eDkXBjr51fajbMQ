Awful!   Short list; Cashiers are rude and unhappy, All sides are made beforehand and scooped per order (COLD SIDES). Will charge you for just about anything (Sauces and refills) Frankly, the BBQ is just not that good (just bland, nothing special about it)  Being an ASU student, I frequent many of the restaurants around the area. This place was one I was the most excited about. It is such a disappointment. This place has won awards so obviously it used to be good, but they have dropped their standards so much it's sad. Workers don't care if your happy, they use customer tables to complete tasks, not one of them smiles or will even look you in the eye, BBQ is a bland as it can possibly be and the sides are just scooped onto your plate cold.   It is without a doubt the worst restaurant  in the ASU area.

I'm a musician and an ASU Student so I've been coming here for 7 months for their food, drink, and Open MiC  Short List: Get's really busy! Long lines at rushes Small but good alcohol selection! Great food!  Has an Open Mic! Great ambiance!   This is such a great place! I started coming here for Open Mic and it has easily become one of my favorite spots at ASU. Getting a drink after class, great food, great ambiance and character, and the people who work there are fantastic! The only downside is that it can get busy so don't go there thinking I'm going to grab a quick bite. Sit your butt down, grab a beer, and take some time to relax!
