My new favorite local wine bar and hang out!  I called ahead because I have food allergies and wanted to ask a few questions- host that answered was very nice and helpful. Same when we got there- everyone working was happy, upbeat and friendly. Nice live band but not so loud you couldn't talk. The waitress brought me 2 wines to taste before I ordered a bottle. Food was very good and priced right. Nice atmostphere. We will be back on a regular basis!

Been to many nail salons around the valley and will drive out of the way to come here. Their prices are great, they are super clean. The owner is amazing and everyone is always friendly! My daughter and I have been here many times and always happy with the quality of the services. Thank you!

Was super excited to see a little wine bar in our area, sadly I will not be back. The wine selection was very few, and very overpriced for the area. We ordered 3 appetizers to try: scallops were small and dry, satay was just not good and the olive bowl was greesy and full of brim- nothing near the quality you should serve at a wine bar. We sat outside on the small patio area for a full 15 minutes before a waitress even came over to take our order. I can understand a wait if it's busy but it wasn't. Noone working was very friendly and not worth a trip back.

I love this place! Super clean and friendly, great prices. I love that they really talk with you about your needs, skin care etc before recommending a package. Owner is always there and super knowledgeable and very nice. Very comfortable here and the little extras really make you feel special- especially the cold water is really nice when leaving!
