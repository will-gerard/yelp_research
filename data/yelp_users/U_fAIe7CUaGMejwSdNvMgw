Has the feel of your regular neighborhood airport parking service.  The lot isn't much to look at, but it always has a space for my car. The drivers are regular Joes who portage your bags and appreciate tips.  They drive you from your car to the automatic sliding doors of the airport, which is even more convenient than parking at the airport as you have to walk from your parking spot to the elevators, and cheaper.  There's always a deal.  In fact, the attendants force you to take a deal if you forget to print a coupon.  Your AAA card will always work in a pinch.  The Yelp deal is good too.  The buses are distinctive and easy to find as long as you don't confuse them with the airport's shuttle.  Make sure to read your ticket and go to the right side of the terminal.  I keep going back because Sky Harbor Airport Parking is quick and reliable.  And during the holidays, you may get lucky and board the Christmas van.  It is decked out with more decorations than your average neighborhood.  And the driver will tell you the story of the candy cane on the way.

We couldn't have asked for a better school than the Awakening Seed.    My daughter started over the summer in the Preschool 2.5/3's class, and then moved to the 3's in the fall.  We enrolled her the following year with the preschool 4's.  The school has a strong focus on social-emotional development, which was exactly what we needed.  Instead of focusing strictly on punishment tactics to moderate behavior, teachers employed a variety of techniques to help students learn positive, adaptive reactions to stressful situations.  One technique I liked was simply to show students the consequences of their behavior (e.g., what happens when you hit another child) and to suggest more effective strategies to expressing yourself.  The school has a vast play area in the back.  Both years, my daughter's class had a class garden.  At times, the teachers would design the curriculum to follow the interest of students.  In preschool 3's, my daughter's class hosted parents and the other grades in a restaurant with chefs, greeters, servers, and a Mariachi band.  The school fosters a community environment by inviting parents to participate in activities and holding periodic school-wide events.  My family had recently moved to Arizona and was thankful to meet some other parents and schedule play dates for my daughter.  I will always have fond memories of the Seed.

Either I'm growing up or the games aren't what they use to be.  I believe the latter as I really haven't grown up that much.  For one, most of the video games have been replaced by small mechanical rides.  The rides seem really lame, but my daughter has a compulsive need to try each one.  Most of the non-ride token consuming devices spit out limited amounts of tickets unless faced with an extreme display of skill or the slightest bit of luck.  Many of the ticket games are kiss your token good-bye in two seconds or less and see what happens.  Otherwise, there were some mediocre racing games.  I conducted a thorough search of the premises.  The ball pit has shrunk, but with an increase in the second floor tunnel system.  The decor now includes Chuck E Cheese parities of TV shows and movies like The C Files, Chuckfeld, and Chuck Trek that are amusing.  My daughter loves the blue screen where her image appears on some screens in the dining area in front of whatever is playing.  As with most times we come, we came for a birthday.  The Chuck E Cheese balloon that greets you at the table is really cool.  It's fun to watch the little ones try and grasp tickets in the wind tube, a must see.  And the pizza is pizza.  The caffeinated apple soda was interesting.  After realizing there was no coke, I had root beer.  All in all, the location is small and needs better video games, but is fun for the kids.  Too bad they don't Yelp.

My daughter really wanted to go to Sweet Tomatoes.  After some prodding, I told her we could go, but I wanted to find out what was behind this instance that we have Sweet Tomatoes for lunch.  What did she hold to be the very essence of Sweet Tomatoes that was driving her to say that we must go?  Here is my interview.  Interview with my daughter.  Me: What  do you like about Sweet Tomatoes?  Mira: The dessert and the pizza.  Me: What else do you like?  Mira: The food.  Me: But, why do you like coming HERE?  Mira: Because .  . . Of . . . the FOOD!  Me: Is there anything else you like besides the food?  Mira: The drinks.

Whether it is true or not, eating at Ra reinforces my self-concept that ... I ... am ... COOL.  Naturally, there is a fifteen minute wait.  Cool people have to wait to be cool.  We sat at a table in the bar area and just had our meal there as you can order off the full menu and don't have to wait for your buzzer to go off.  Cool people don't have to wait the full amount of the wait time.  Happy hour lasts till 7 and offers an array of sushi and non-sushi items.  Cool people eat sushi.  I ordered the salmon and spicy shrimp nigiri and the pork gyoza just for me.  My wife ordered some vegetarian items and unfiltered sake for us.  Cool people get it unfiltered.  My items came quickly.  The vegetarian items did not.  When I inquired about this, we received an apology and two of the vegetarian items for free.  How cool is that?  Very!!  All the food was great, and the desserts are especially creative.

I arrived with my three year old asleep in her car seat.  She was probably out for the night.  I promptly woke her up and after passing a rather large bull we entered the cave.  A few more turns and we entered the restaurant on the second floor.  At this point, we were given the choice of slide or stairs down to the dining area.  I parted ways with my daughter at this point.  I didn't need The DVD player to entertain her this meal, the slide entertained her till the food arrived.  She came back briefly in tears with an incoherent story about some collision, and then went back to sliding.  With some older kids present, letting a three year old free to slide was a little dubious, but sipping my water in silence left me unconcerned.  I ordered a kids meal, grilled cheese, for her and I had meat.  My daughter ate her meal with a napkin and paper bull horns.  For my part, meat is good.  Clearly a tourist stop, as reflected in the price and by the d√©cor, I've been waiting for some non-vegetarian relative to visit so that I can return.

I like checking in here because Yelp thinks I'm working out and really I just bring my kid here to swim lessons.  The instructors are great and the kids actually learn how to swim.  Neither of those two points was true at the last place, but at least my daughter loves to play in the water even if she doesn't like the thought of going to her lessons.  I'm not sure why she thinks this, apprehension at transitions, because she always seems to have fun in lessons.  SwimKids is very kid friendly.  There's the mini indoor playground so that even waiting is fun.  There are the two mini pools with four simultaneous lessons of one to three kids.  There's the mini Olympic stand to announce moving up.  After kids pass their less-than-stealth assessment, the kid gets to ring a bell and announce this fact to the entire pool.  Then the kid gets a medal and a picture on the stand so that the same info can be announced to the waiting room.  My kid wore her first medal for four days straight.  If your kid gets bored of playing in the waiting room, they can also watch a movie on TV.   Defying there namesake, SwimKids also offers dance and gymnastics.  As gymnastics was full, we're doing dance, which probably fits in well with other dance classes we do. Hey, we don't have the tag along kid (i.e., a sibling), we can over schedule and indulge in too many classes.

Recommended by my dentist, I read the Yelp reviews in the waiting room to get a sense of what awaited me.  **Begin aside.**  Have you ever bit your cheek.  Usually it becomes sensitive and grows back into your cheek.  My protrusion was not all that sensitive, and I kept biting it.  It kept growing out and I needed it removed.  This requires minor dental surgery.  That was all I knew. **End aside.**  I didn't know the cost, what the surgery would entail, nada. The waiting room seems to be about an average size and includes a fish tank.  The rest of the office includes a vast array of rooms.  I had a quick preliminary examine by Dr. Fish.  By the way, I was expecting a woman, but obviously Leslie is also a male name.  He gave me the diagnosis and treatment plan.  Next, I was ushered into another room and was told the price and the surgery was scheduled.  The price varied by the anesthetic.  I opted for the cheapest option, local anesthetic only.  Adding laughing gas was an extra charge, which means you are still awake, but a little loopy.  The third option was to be entirely knocked out.  In addition, the protrusion that was cut out of my mouth was sent to a lab for analysis to determine whether it was benign or malignant.  This was an extra charge, and I still don't know what the cost will be.  I arrived for my appoint still a little unsure of what was going to happen.  I had scheduled it for 7 AM on a Monday morning.  There seem to be set times for surgeries and set times for examinations.  By the time I was shown to my room, there were ten to twelve other people in the waiting room.  I had a nurse?? take my vitals.  I was connected to a machine that takes your blood pressure every fifteen minutes or so.  I was given a topical anesthetic to get the numbness going.  Dr. Fish came by and used a pinching tool to inject the rest of the local anesthetic.  Then we waited for the numbness to take over my right cheek.  Dr. Fish came in later, asked for another nurse, and started the procedure.  I could feel some punching from tools I assumed were used to keep my cheek open for cutting.  I saw some bloody on tools, but didn't feel any cutting.  Apparently, there was a smaller protrusion starting to grow next to the main protrusion, and Dr. Fish cut that one out as well.  It took under ten minutes.  After the procedure was over, gauze was inserted into my mouth.  I bled for another three hours and had to change the gauze every half hour.  After the surgery, I was shown to the recovery area that had alcoves with beds.  One women was asleep.  I guess she took option number three.  I was given a goody bag with the extra gauze, a prescription for penicillin and a heavy duty pain killer (I think it was percocet), and a pillow case.  I was also given the talk for someone with stitches in their mouth.  No alcohol.  No mouthwash.  No solid foods for a few days, and then keep it soft, etc.  I was supposed to come back the following Monday, but was leaving for vacation on Saturday, so I came back on Friday instead.  In the end, although I didn't know what to expect, everything went very smoothly and professionally.  Despite the reviews I read on Yelp, the price was explained up front with several options.  I also had to pay for the penicillin, (I didn't need the pain killer, just used some Motrin) and the analysis of my mouth tissue.  But such things are to be expected.  I could have refused to have my mouth tissue analyzed and prayed that it wasn't malignant, but I like sleeping at night.  I wouldn't want to have oral surgery again, but if I did, I would go back to Dr. Fish.

The Best of Phoenix issue did not disappoint me or my daughter.  I got a delicious combination of spiciness.  The complimentary chips come with a variety of dips - salsa, bean dip, and some kind of creamy goodness.  The daughter was a little skeptical of all three options, so more for me.  I see other reviews referring to four dips, so maybe I was drunk off of over eating.  At the end, they give you a sapodilla to ensure that your belly is full and round.  The daughter was happy about that and I had to roll myself back to the car.

Okay, okay, this isn't me giving Skateland Chandler five starts.  This is my daughter giving Skateland Chandler five stars.  She loves roller staking, and is determined to skate despite just having skated a few times.  It may be the sport she is most passionate about.  The first couple of times, I got skates.  Now, why bother?  So, it is a pretty good deal for me, too.  She just skates with her friend, and I get to read my book until they want a snack, and then until they want some tokens.  The snacks are what you would expect from a skating rink, so I am stingy with the money.  Skateland Chandler mixes up the free skating with a variety of games and whatnot.  My daughter and her friend seem to be picky about what games they are willing to play, even with the ones that require very little actual skating skill.  Join the email list, and you'll get a bunch of deals landing in your inbox.  The prices are already basement cheap.  Last time we went the friend won 500 tickets off of one token, and I (meaning, my daughter) won a snake from a raffle.

An ode to Chipotle.  Oh Chipotle, why do I love you so? Is it the funky art? Is it the Marketing campaign about the quality of your ingredients? Is it the barbacoa that no one else has (yes, by the way)? Why?  Oh. Why? Is it the messages on my cup and wrappers? Is it the pictures of your restaurants in your restaurants? Is it the burrito that has ruined all other burritos (yes, by the way)? Oh Chipotle, why do I love you so?

At first, I couldn't decide whether this place was kid friendly.  I usually shy away from restaurant slash bars with loud music and loud patrons.  On the other hand, they have high chairs, a kids menu with a word search, a number tracing picture, and tic tac toe.  There are nine, count'em, nine kid's menu items, and four are vegetarian friendly.  And there is a "family room".  I was still not convinced.  The first time I came here there was a party going on in the family room, and it seemed like we were just crammed in the corner of the restaurant.  So my daughter's school had a fundraiser at Teakwoods.  Fifteen percent of the bill went to support the school.  Maybe kid friendly, but still not connived.  Could the school be wrong?  The place was slammed and, at first, I thought we would be waiting for long periods of time for not showing up early, but management was helping pick up the slack and I assume that it was an unusually high volume Monday.  My daughter was a little skeptical about throwing peanuts on the floor, so I'm not sure if that counts as kid friendly.  She would hold out the peanut shell and watch it fall in disbelief.  There is also a video game machine with two classic arcade games, one was Galaga, one of those hutin' shootin' games, and a claw.  I resisted my daughter's urge to spend my money.  And then I noticed that the kids were playing Duck, Duck, Goose on the floor in the family room.  Okay, this places is definitely kid friendly.  How dare you think otherwise.  The wings are great, the beer cold, the Ruben dry, the spaghetti a little light on the sauce, the cups large, the wait staff overwhelmed, why didn't I get wings like last time, and Teakwoods is kid friendly.

Great go to lunch spot.  More authentic than the typical Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.  You know you're in good shape when you are asked, "Corn or flour?"  And "Red or green?" for hot sauce.  Salsa is available at the counter.  Drink options include watermelon, melon, horchata, soda, and water.  The menu offers 23 numbered lunch options six numbered breakfast options and an array of a la carte options and sides.  The TV is always in Spanish and the walls display paintings with optical illusions that blend in with the decor.  Look for Taco Nazo next to the REI.

I was looking for a car stereo that included a plug for my iPod.  The tape deck connection was not working out so well.  It kept reversing and then ejecting the tape.  I was also looking for a place that would install the stereo system for me.  The lowest end car stereo was $80 and for an extra $20 it included Bluetooth.  I was quoted $100 for 1 hour of service, and returned the next day to have it installed.  The stereo is great; it includes a USB and auxiliary port.  I can just plug in my iPod, and the stereo does the rest.  The iPod starts playing after I turn the ignition, and the iPod stops after I turn the car.  The staff at Sounds Good to Me was friendly and helpful.  After the stereo was installed, the installer set up the Bluetooth on my phone and showed me how it worked.

An Ode to Walmart: It's Walmart  A senior citizen handing out carts at the door.  My cart doesn't roll straight.  I'm not surprised.  There are no baskets, just carts.  Is that a hint?  It's Walmart.  More babies than a daycare.  More seniors than a senior center.  And tattoos for everyone.  It's Walmart.  Cardboard kingdoms of snacks, a tower of cheese balls bigger than you head for $5.98 each, a wall of ramen labeled "Cup-O-Soup," and a kid putting cheese balls bigger than your head into his family's cart.  It's Walmart.  Fifty cent clearance plastic margarita glasses.  A crate of $5 DVDs bigger than my bathtub.  The PA announces "All loaders, code 60.  All loaders, code 60."  It's Walmart.  A pharmacy, vision center, credit union, grocery store, hair dresser, automotive section, toy store, bike shop, Home Depot, and Office Depot all under one roof.  I think I got lost twice.  It's Walmart.  Profits measured one penny at a time.  Is Walmart a savior for the poor or does Walmart enable poverty?  Economist can't decide.  Does Walmart help the environment by working with vendors to reduce and remove packaging, and engaging in some environmental friendly projects.  Environmentalists have decided.  It's Walmart.  Self-checkout with a weight sensor to keep you honest.  They've never checked my receipt at the exit.  Is it because I'm white?  It's Walmart.  Patrons leave their carts at the bus stop.  Where did that hour of my life go?

We joined Lifetime for the indoor and outdoor pools.  Yes, that equals year around pool access.  And we seem to be remaining members because they have parents' night out, which is four hours of babysitting on periodic Saturday nights for a cool $15.  And there are also the kids camps when my daughter's school has a holiday.  We tried the swim lessons, but the instruction was lacking.  As far as exercising there, my wife worked out there at one point and enjoyed the Zumba class.  Now there's even a Zumba class for kids.  And there's the prospect that she will work out there again one day, but it looks doubtful as she keeps adding flamenco dance classes to her schedule.  Recently, she is up to three flamenco's a week.  I'm about to get back into my work out routine.  No, seriously, stop laughing.  The cafe is great, and the spa looks really nice.  The spa worked really well for me when I needed to pick up a last minute valentine's gift, I mean, gift card.  Thanks, LT.

Great place for kids.  Don't forget to ask about the Junior Ranger activities.  There is a small indoor nature center and a variety of hiking trails around a lake and the river.  The trails are all very kid friendly.  Various signs point the way and name the flora.  I find that the Junior Ranger activities help engage kids who look around and after ten minutes of hiking say, "What's next?".  We usually go through three phases of Junior Ranger activity engagement.  The first is antipathy.  In the beginning, it just seems to daunting.  The parents start doing it and having fun.  Then the second stage starts -- engagement achieved.  Everyone is involved.  Not only is the activity doable, but it is fun.  During this stage, the family gets to explore the environs.  After walking around the park, there is usually just a narrative left that stands in the way of the kid and the reward.  An insurmountable task during the first phase, during the third phase, get it done and get the reward, it is completed in short order.  Throughout, the parents insert pearls of wisdom during obvious teachable moments.  And at the end, everyone forgets the first stage, and agrees that they had fun the whole time.

The Maricopa County Fair is an unadulterated money pit.  Everything costs a few bucks including parking, entrance, food, and rides.  Just about all of the food is fried, and there seems to be some sort of contest among fairs as to which fair has the most unusual fried food.  The rides are a few bucks a person.  A few bucks times a family is a lot of bucks, just to ride the Ferris Wheel.   You can get a wrist band, but that's only good for one person.  The shows are free, and the kids seem to enjoy them.  There was also an exhibition hall with photography and art contests winners, vendors, and scientific presentations from local schools.  One poster tried to convince me that the same gun could be presented in a manner that looked more dangerous or less dangerous, which I believe was meant to convince me that guns weren't dangerous, but just reminded me that I live in Maricopa County.    My favorite part was getting the shirt.  For some reason, I really liked the shirt.

An oasis of little kid fun in Phoenix, we hadn't been in over a year and came for a birthday party.  They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.  There are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.  There are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.  All are a big hit with the kids, but also hit up the wallet for a few bucks a piece.  Everyone is a winner at ball toss, by the way.

This review is for the kids camps.  In search of a winter camp for my daughter, I luckily stumbled upon Mesa Center for the Arts.  We signed up for the three days after New Year's.  Honestly, I felt like there wasn't much information available on what the kids would be doing, and was hoping that what I cobbled together from a phone call and searching online wasn't too good to be true.  Happily, I can report that the camp fully met my expectations.  The curriculum includes performance arts (acting/drama, dance, and music) and visual arts (e.g., puppetry, painting, drawing).  I'm just trying to recall what my daughter actually did in those three days.  The potential projects that are possible seem to run the gambit of classes offered to adults.  I was looking for a camp opportunity where my daughter can have fun and learn something and not just play all day.  You know.  You pick up your child and ask them what they did.  "Nothing."  "You did nothing!?"  "I don't remember."  "Did you have fun?"  "Yes."  Mesa Center for the Arts provides a good balance of actually learning something and having fun.  My daughter made a variety of puppets (e.g., finger, sock) that are displayed in our living room.  She also made a dream catcher, a sun catcher, and some paintings and drawings.  She always had great stories to tell me after camp.  One day she couldn't stop talking about how much fun she had in dance class.  Kids signed up day-to-day in winter camp, and all of the projects lasted one day.  Summer camp will be week-to-week, and I am keen to see what the week-long projects look like.

Used a Groupon to get some video cassettes converted to DVD.  A couple days after dropping off the tapes, I realized that a video had fallen between the seats of my car.  I was too lazy to ask if it could be added to my group of video cassettes.  A few weeks later I got the call to pick up my DVDs.  I asked about the additional cassette, and was told that they would just do it right away at the Groupon price.  Twenty minutes later I had all of my video cassettes DVDs in hand.  Overall, I would say that worked out well.

Make no mistake, this is a booze cruise and is not family friendly.  We had observed the booze cruise of tubes from one of the recreation areas along the Salt River, but still wanted to give it a try as my daughter was finally old enough to go.  We thought that father's day might be a little tamer than the usual outing.  Who knows, it might have been.  Everyone brings marshmallows and litters them throughout the river.  One group had marshmallows the size of bricks.  I had to pick up one to figure out what it was.  Drunk people will also shot their water guns at you for fun, even if you have a small child.  Probably because they are drunk.  Some children through some water balloons at my wife.  When she confronted them, the father asked her what she was going to do about it.  This is a good representation of the type of people on the river.  I can see how this would be fun for social drinks, with or without kids, I suppose.  Bring your alcohol, and when you're done with a can, throw it into the river.  The bottom is lined with cans.  No glass is allowed.  It is also expensive for tubing compared to other tubing trips I've been on.  But guess what folks, that's how a monopoly operates.  High prices and poor customer service.

The Arizona Renaissance Festival should be on the annual to do list of all Phoenicians.  We make the pilgrimage down the sixty to middle of no where Arizona, which is just a little past Gilbert, every year.  Ren Fest occupies a village of permanent structures and stages that are used seasonally during the extended weekends and holidays from mid February through March.  This past year we came in February and found that it was a little less crowded then when we slip in our visit before the end of March.  We usually find our way to Clan Tinkers, a juggling act with other feats of daring.  The past two visits have found us witnessing the joust.  This last time, we sat in the section of the bad guy.  Luckily, it was the middle show, which meant that he won the round.  My daughter wasn't sure why he was the bad guy.  And our visit isn't complete without running into Fairy Twig.  Some of the shows aren't appropriate for our daughter with their off color humor, others are just questionable, but hey, it's Ren Fest.  Usually she wants to buy everything in sight.  She also goes on some of the rides, like the giant tower serpent of fun slide, a large rocking horse, and the joust ride. She's outgrown the free rides.  There's also food for everyone if you look for it.  The turkey legs make me sick, and I've heard that it is really Emu.  What turkey is that big?  My daughter seeks out the pizza, or a burrito will do.  My wife eats only the crepes.  I favor anything with meat.  This last visit I happened upon the sausages.

I was casing this place to see if it could measure up and be included in the lunch rotation.  Instead, it became an anecdote.  Or maybe I didn't measure up, and was being encouraged not to include Pita House in my lunch rotation.  About halfway through my visit, I knew this was a one-time visit.  All the signs were piling up.  I entered the take out section and was led to the dining area.  Obviously a first timer, the waitress seemed bemused by my newness and uncompelled to offer any assistance.  Maybe she knew I wasn't returning before I did.  I felt like I was being marked for sides, drinks, and up sales rather than being welcomed.  By the time the food came, I had already decided not to return unless it was the best lunch ever and the meal was between okay and good, but closer to good.  There are so few places where rudeness is part of the charm of the place.  It is just so hard to pull off.  I had the chicken shawarma.  The chicken cubes were juicy, and the tahini sauce was good, but lacking.  On the plus side, there doesn't seem to be a shortage of restaurants in downtown Scottsdale.  Next!!

With our regular Indian place converted to buffet and my lunch companions refusing to go (don't tell them, but I would go anyway), it was time to find a new Indian spot for the work lunch rotation.  We were on a mission and I was trying to figure out whether Jewel would be added to the list of acceptable lunch haunts.  After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage, we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant.  Travel time was starting to negate Jewel from the list.  The lunch menu was small, and we all ordered the thali meat combination.    After a modest wait time the food arrived in an array of metal containers and was delicious.  I hope we go back, but majority rules.

Don't go to Pepin for the food, and I'm not saying that because of a lack of Spanish authenticity; it just doesn't taste good, ever ... usually.  This time wasn't bad and last time they didn't have my first three choices, not exaggerating.  But that doesn't explain the previous two visits.  Also, the prices are high, especially given my first comment.  If you can hurdle both of those comments, there are lots of reasons to go to Pepin.  You can order sangria by the liter, my wife keeps wanting to go, they have live flamenco dancing, my wife likes the good, the ambience feels Spanish, and they play upbeat flamenco music in the background.

King Buffet 2000 had me at the word buffet, and I recommend renaming the establishment The Buffet of 2000 Kings.  They have sausage with potatoes and onions, and if you are too good for potatoes, they also have it with just onions.  I was two good for potatoes on my second visit, but based on my first visit, I can say that the potatoes are good.  You can't go wrong either way.  And as a bonus, the sausage is even a little spicy.  A lot of the seafood was also good: the salmon, the other fish of the day, the clams, and the pineapple shrimp dish looked interesting.  The pineapple shrimp might have been good, but I couldn't risk the remaining room in my stomach.  The Chinese dishes and disserts were okay.  The wait staff was almost too attentive, and the meal was under $9 including the drink.  And for some reason, walking through an arch makes me feel special.

My family's favorite Ethiopian restaurant.  I usually order the spicy combination. instead of the meat combination because it is really just a spicy meat combination.  The lunch specials are also a good deal with good portion sizes.  My daughter has counted Lalibela as one of her top five favorite restaurants since she could count to five.  It was nice to have a restaurant that didn't serve pizza in the top five.  She usually has the red lentils even though they are a little spicy.  My wife loves the vegetarian combination.  And a bottle of honey wine completes the meal.

A really great restaurant, this deserves to be said first, and the best vegan/vegetarian in Tempe.  Going on my best of Tempe list.  If you are one of my anonymous followers on Yelp, you know I love meat.  When we make plans to eat at Green, I get excited because the food is great despite the fact that there is no meat.  They just make great food at Green.  I usually get one of fruit-flavored sodas that come in the glass bottles from the refrigerators next to where your order your food.  Never had one that tasted good, but it is fun trying them all.  Maybe one day I'll start worrying about my sugar intake.  And the tSoynami's are really good, but closer to a dessert than a drink.  The wings were suggested to me on my first visit, which seemed a bit daring for a vegan restaurant, but . . . they were great and I get them all the time.  I would not recommend a vegan pizza unless you know what you are getting yourself into.  My mostly vegetarian daughter lives off of cheese and mushroom pizza, but couldn't stomach the vegan verity.  Now she has the crab puffs and peanut tofu appetizers.  And my vegetarian wife gets whatever she wants and doesn't have to ask about unmentioned ingredients, which I have been told is a rare and liberating experience.  The layout of the interior provides a friendly and inviting atmosphere.  We usually try to snag the couches.  Art from aspiring artist usually decorate the walls, and the bathrooms offer really cool sinks.  Opposite the wall of art is a mural made up of re-used and re-claimed materials.  I like it and my daughter always has a few questions about it (e.g., Are those car doors real?  What is that?), which gives me a chance to point out that re-using is even better than recycling, although both have merit.  A few more visits to Green, and I'm sure my daughter will know what I'm talking about.  And our Tempe location, the original location, is better than your Phoenix location.  There, I said it.  But maybe I should try the Phoenix location first.

I wasn't sure whether I should write this review because I have a healthy fear of being whacked.  Three co-workers and I sidled in one day and our first impression was that we were eating at a front for the mob.  We felt less than welcome when we entered and none of the people by the cash register cared to acknowledge us.  Begrudgingly, we were given a table.  The furniture was something out of an old folk's home.  Everyone squeaked into their seats.  We weren't sure whether we belonged, and then we noticed that the only other patrons were old folks.  My friend ordered pasta and paid extra for meatballs, actually, for one whole meatball.  What I ordered was very forgettable.  It took a while, but we finally got our food, which seemed odd as it was quite plain and entirely unremarkable.  We split the bill with one person paying cash and the rest using credit cards.  It took over ten minutes to get our cards back with receipts, which was odd as we were the only people left in the place.  The waitress admonished us for making her life difficult.  I pointed out that my card had my picture on it, and was told that was part of the problem.  Immediately, upon returning to the office, we all checked our bank accounts.  We were all charged for our meals except for one of my co-workers who was charged for all four meals, even the one who paid cash..

The building shaped like a cake that was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.  Parking close by in the front lot or a covered lot nearby.  Broadway quality shows every year.  Never had a bad seat.  Always a great experience for the entire family.  What isn't there to love?  We've seen the Wicked, Beauty and the Beast, and the Adams Family among other shows.  My favorite was Shrek the Musical.  I hope that doesn't mean I have no taste in Broadway shows.  If you get up right away at intermission, the line at the bathroom isn't too bad.  The wait for the men's room usually isn't long, but the women's line can get long.  There are also several bathrooms.  We usually aim for the top floor bathrooms.  The concessions are also useful for staving off the hunger of the young one until the end of the show.

First, I came here with a coupon from one of those entertainment books my daughter's school sells.  Many items were excluded including the lunch specials and the menudo.  Apparently, to be truly Mexican you have to enjoy eating a cow's stomach in soup -- menudo.  So Eli M. and I vowed to return one day.  Ah, yes, I am not even a little Mexican, but suffer from a proclivity to try unusual foods others turn up their noses at.  Enter Groupon.  Having purchased a Groupon that excluded the lunch specials, but not the menudo, Eli M. and I, with some friends in tow, made our return.  I told Eli M. that menudo costing less than $7 seemed a little dubious given the extensive perpetuation process he described, but we didn't let a little thing like that deter us. As the menudo was cheaply priced, I also ordered a chorizo burrito a la carte.  I was trying to max out the Groupon, and soup, regardless of the contents, didn't seem that filling.  Eli M. doesn't eat much and was satisfied with just a medium sized bowl of menudo. In terms of taste however, he said that it was okay.  He said it was too greasy, which is what our friends also said of their food.  Moreover, they have Pepsi instead of Coke.  And the location is a bit out off the quick lunch radius.  So, it looks like Eli M. and I will max out at two visits to Susie's.  Thanks for the menudo.

You have holes in the wall, holes in the ground, dumps, fine dining, casual dining, fast food, and something called the Benihana.  If you have been searching your whole life for a box that serves chuck, the name doesn't lie, look no further.  In close proximity to Arizona State University, the Chuck Box fills that niche for a homesick student looking for some of daddy's buggers made on the grill.  No need to wait for the weekend, the onion rings are also great and the condiment bar is free range just like at home.  You can order you burger by the size or by non-free topping or you can get chicken.  There is also outdoor seating if you don't mind sitting on a stump.

What happened to Caffe Boa?  Gone are the days of the extravagant menu with oddities, including beats that were pallatelable.  A true miracle occurred on that day at Caffe Boa when I ate a beat with gourmet cheese and liked it.  Now you get a one pager with limited vegetarian options, which is really more of a problem for my wife and kid than for me, but that's two out of three of the family.  We arrived after watching a show at the Gammage, which I have learned is a mistake.  The restaurant was less then 2/3rds full, and I didn't have to feel bad about saying that we didn't need a reservation.  Over an hour later the restaurant was full and our food arrived.  Did I mention that grandma was with us and I have a kid, but let me back up a bit.  So we were told that just about any of the entrees could be made vegetarian.  Against her better judgment, my wife went along with this statement as there really wasn't any other option unless she wanted a kid's meal.  So it is over an hour later and her food has MEAT in it.  One of our bastions of vegetarianism . . . gone.  Gone!!  Gone, I tell you.  So, I, grandma, and the kid enjoy our meals with a fuming mommy and then leave as other people lodge complaints with the servers about the poor service.

Rubios fills that niche of I need to get my kid from after school care to the Tuesday swim lesson in one hour or less with food in her belly.  I've been exploring different options; at least I was until I found Rubio's.  The first thing you notice is the great service.  As I'm not a regular quite yet, I usually spend a few minutes studying the menu.  The staff at Rubio's has perfected the art of not starring me down during my minutes of quiet contemplation, which seems to be a lost art at other establishments.  After ordering, the staff brings you your order.  Casual dining with wait staff service.  Tip #1.  Sit near the salsa bar when with child.  It makes getting extra napkins easy.  The wait is short.  I've measured this based on my daughter's behavior after we sit down and she immediately says, "I'm hungry and I want my food NOW!!" Although saying, "We just ORDERDED!!" doesn't help; we've never gotten to the melt down stage.  The food has always made it with time to spare.  Tip #2. You can never have enough napkins.  So, save the Earth by just getting a few and more as needed.  You sat next to the salsa bar, right?  The food is good for the price and there are many options.  So you don't have to order the same thing each week.  Tip #3. Mixing the onion cilantro with one of the salsas is a good combination.  Comparatively speaking, I like that my daughter and I can eat something on the healthy side of the casual dining spectrum.  Usually, a bean and cheese burrito for her and fish tacos for me.  The quality seems appropriate for casual dining, although I could do with some more sauce in my tacos.  Tip #4. The churro makes a good incentive to finish the growing food for you and your kid, but you have to get a kids meal.  The Churro is the real bonus.  On Thursday, my daughter suggested that we go to Rubios.  Telling her that we go every Tuesday didn't seem to make a difference.  We take the churro to go and my daughter eats it on the way to swim.

Oregano's might be the place for you if (1) you enjoy waiting for a table, (2) you need a bucket of Coke while you wait for a table, (3) you want to consummate your bromance with you bff, (4) you like drinking a bucket of coke with your meal, or (5) you need a bucket of coke to go.  If you are a kid, you might like Oregano's if you like to play with your food.  Instead of a toy, kids get some dough upon request.  They'll even bake it for you.  The wait staff is overly friendly.  I once received a high five for my order selection.  Unfortunately, I was a little confused about receiving a high five for placing my order and left the waitress hanging for a few seconds.  If you can't tell, I really like this place, and it is a stand by in the lunch rotation when we leave for lunch by 11:15 AM.  If it is 11:30 AM, forget about it.

One if my buddies hikes Camelback twice a week.  It turns out this is quite common, and how come I've never done the hike before.  Or so I was accosted on the way to the mountain.  You find all manner of hiker on the mountain: runners, joggers, pushy joggers (no literally), power walkers, kids, really small kids, impossibly small kids, families with impossibly small kids, hikers, hikers with poles, college students, college athletes, some guy typing a review on his iPhone, another guy with a camo water pack and blood streaming down the back of his arm, people who hike around the trailer but never on it, four-legged climbers, and my dad.  The problem with this is that there are no places to park on Saturday mornings.  So we paid five bucks each to do the Park n' Ride shuttle from Paradise Valley Town Hall.  After a quick bathroom break at the police station, we were ready.  Park n' Ride hooked us up with waters, granola bars, and bananas.  We were dropped off outside the parking lot and walked to the trail.  Based on some advice from Park n' Ride, we decide to go up Cholla and down Echo.  Hiking Camelback is an adventure, at least, probably the first fifteen times.  The Cholla trail starts with some stairs and you catch the great view of the city right away.  Halfway up, I had to dodge a boulder someone knocked loose, and was told that I had quick reflexes for looking up and not walking into the thing.  At the saddle you can see the view on both sides.  At the top, we stopped to eat the granola bars and bananas.  When it was time to continue, my dad started to chicken out and was interviewing everyone about the perils of the Echo trail in case he wanted to use the option to return down the Cholla trail.  Luckily, he didn't chicken out and going down the Echo route was no big deal.  Sure there are lots of boulders to traverse and some parts that require you to use the hand rails, but going down is so much easier than going up.  Echo felt more canyon like with less views and more rock formations and a little more shade.  After calling Park n' Ride we were whisked back to my car and ready for lunch.  I don't see myself settling into the twice a week routine, but I must admit, Camelback Mountain is a must hike for those Phoenix denizens who enjoy the outdoors.  For the casual hiker, I don't recommend brining kids until you know what you are getting yourself into..

It is not Barnes and Noble, did not go out of business, and you actually have to leave your house to get there.  As a bonus, when you buy something at Changing Hands, you can actually get to hold it in your hands.  At one-sixth the size of a small Barnes and Noble, they still seem to have books that I want to read every time I go for a visit.  The kids section is really nice with toys and books.  I mention the toys because I usually drop my kid off there while I go in search of books.  She just yells out my name when she needs to go to the bathroom or wants me.  It is also a good location to read books to your kids, and sometimes, other people's kids.  There are lots of events.  It's as if they are promoting reading, and not just so that you buy their books.  There are events for kids, events for adults, and lots and lots of book club meetings.  Changing Hands is a popular neighborhood bookstore that promotes a sense of community.  Somehow, it feels very fulfilling to bring my daughter to a non- chain bookstore.  Now if only she were more interested in reading on her own.  Wildflower, the sandwich shop, is next door, connected even.  And Baskin Robbins is a couple doors down.  Nothing says books like a meatball sandwich in one hand and an ice cream cone in the other hand.

P. F Chang's China Bistro has grown on me over the years, and I just really like eating at P. F. Chang's.  Recently, I've been ordering the Dan Dan Noodles.  I like it spicy.  There are also a variety of options for my vegetarian wife and daughter, as in more than one.  In the past, we've ordered the lettuce wraps and dumplings among other items.  But the real reason I am gushing over P. F. Chang's and have a craving for the Dan Dan Noodles is because I just ran the P. F. Chang's Half Marathon.  I couldn't tell you why I crave food from the race sponsor.  Is it the coupons they gave out for naming ten things I liked about the restaurant?  The new app they were promoting that I downloaded?  That the race was a lot of fun and I passed the dragon?  I just really like eating at P. F. Chang's and the food tastes good?  The decor is fun?  No idea.  But I can tell you that I can't wait until our next visit.

Wells Fargo Arena has the feel of an intimate, family friendly sporting complex.  Although I was never an ASU student, I feel like part of the home team.  I taught some psychology classes for ASU and worked on the Polytechnic campus for a stint.  That should count for something.  I've seen a women's basketball game and a gymnastics meet.  Both times, It was general admission and the seats were great.  At the basketball game I caught a shirt.  The gymnastics meet was a Girl Scouting event.  Around the inside walkway are trophies, team photos, and player photos.  At the end of both events, we were allowed to walk around on the court/floor and my daughter was able to interact with the athletes while they autographed memorabilia.  At the gymnastics meet, the women's team signed her shirt while she was wearing it.

Someone from work suggested that we go to this place that has great Philly Cheese Steaks.  So we headed to old town Scottsdale to check it out.  There were four of us, and we sat at the only two tables in the sandwich shop.  The outdoor seating looked good and they cater, but I don't recommend the indoor dining, you might not get a table.  After ordering, one of my friends outed me as a Yelper, an Elite Yelper, in fact.  So the owner started complaining about the negative reviews he gets on Yelp, which is something I can understand.  No need to worry that he'll read this one thought because he said that he doesn't monitor the reviews anymore.  Then he added that the reviews must not be too negative as the Phoenix headquarters for Yelp is across the street and he caters for them often.  That's quite an endorsement, right?  And then he got out his laptop and showed us a parody of Yelpers on Laugh or Die.  Not sure how to take that as I was outed as the Yelper, but it was amusing.  I ordered the Sausage Parm sandwich because I love sausage.  It takes a little longer to prepare than the other sandwiches, and came out looking like two strips of flat hot sausage like those breakfast patties rather than smoked sausage, but the taste confirmed that it was smoked sausage.  On the whole, it was good.  I also ordered the fresh cut fries only to realize later that there was a Yelp deal when I checked in.  The fries were really good.  The others in my group enjoyed their orders as well.  I don't think that anyone got a Philly Cheese Steak.  And they are willing to make whatever sandwich you want.  One of my pals kind of combined two sandwiches because he likes it spicy.  The staff was really nice.  Will we back?  Well yeah, I need to redeem my free fresh cut fries deal.

We came for an evening of Christmas merry making.  We started late in the afternoon with ice skating.  Unable to stand in skates without support from a parent, grandparent, or rail, my daughter had a blast.  Next, we toured the lights in the fading sun of the afternoon.  After that, we toured the light displays  in the moonlight.  Trees were wrapped, and there were various displays including a pirate ship, rocking horse, star fish, some wise men, etc.  The menorah was a nice touch.  After exercising our legs, we visited La Hacienda for dinner.  A great high end Mexican restaurant with a sommelier for the wine and a sommelier for the tequila.  After dinner we headed back to the car via the entrance and happened upon the giant Christmas tree with the lights dancing in step with Christmas music.  A great end to a great evening.

If you were looking for an actual review of Mucho Gusto, then you might want to select one of the other 68 reviews that are currently on Yelp.  Spoiler alert, this review will have very little to do with Mucho Gusto.  Now, if you are looking for the perfectly place to (1) have a book club meeting, (2) you are brining your 5 year old daughter, and (3) the book is True Grit, then look no further than Mucho Gusto.  I guess I should add that my book club friends tell me that the third point is a little thin, but two out of three isn't bad.  In my defense, True Grit is a western, and don't all westerns occur in Arizona.  And then when the white hats settle down they move to California because Florida was too far away.  Of course, now you might say, "Wait a second, isn't Mucho Gusto a Mexican restaurant."  Well, isn't Mexico part of the West, by which I mean, isn't it part of the Western Genre?  In conclusion, the atmosphere is great, you can eat outside, and sometimes the floor is a little slippery.  This review is dedicated to all of the book clubs who have ever had a meeting at Mucho Gusto with or without a five year old.

Honey Bears is where I go for my quick meat fix and I'll tell you why.  It is conveniently located near my house, and I have no doubt that this is true of everyone who is reading this review on Yelp, and they have lots of meat.  If for some reason you are unsure of what to order, let me break it down for you.  Order the choice of two combo sandwich with pork and hot links with a side of fries.  Skip the soda because soda is unhealthy.  But if you have to get a soda, get the Big Red.  Isn't that cool, they have Big Red.  Why pork?  I tried the beef once, and let me just tell you that it is no pig.  Why hot links?  It is the closest thing they have to sausage.  What you do is take the half with the hot links and eat it first.  Just dip the whole open faced sandwich into the BBQ sauce and eat it one delicious bite at a time.  After savoring the hot links, you'll realize that you still have half a sandwich left, but that you are a little buned out.  So instead of eating the other half of your sandwich the same way you just ate the hot links, what you need to do is take each French fry and use it like some nan or pita to scoop up some of the pork, dip it into the BBQ sauce, and eat it.  The fries have way too much salt, but that just seems to make them taste better than those fries that have just a lot of salt.  You may need to drink a gallon of water after the meal, but let me tell you this, you won't be hungry.  In fact, you may have a little bit of a stomach ache if you weren't able to stop when realized that you were full.  It happens and you'll still be thirsty.  But you won't be hungry.

One day out of the blue, my wife says that I should take our dog, Jada, to the dog park.  With vague directions on where to go, my daughter and I found the Chandler playground equipped with a swimming pool and the Bark Park.  The Park Bark offers a large fenced in enclosure with a two gate system to enter.  I let Jada off her leash after traversing the second gate.  She was the smallest dog in the park, but all of the other larger dogs were friendly and there was no actual barking.  The larger dogs were playing fetch with balls and Frisbees.  I suspect that most of the owners who take their dogs to the Bark Park have well behaved dogs.  Turns out that Jada is more of a people person, and hung out with me most of the time rather than interacting with the other dogs.  She didn't explore much, so my daughter and I took her over to the training area for some doggy alone time.  The training area is a slightly smaller, yet large fenced in area with ramps and dog-sized horse jumps.  The Bark Park is a great place if you are looking to give your dog some off leash time in the city.  I would recommend a few poop bags and some toys.

So I had my daughter and one of her friends with me and decided to brave a Costco visit.  They have lots of samples and toys.  We tried a lot of samples, but didn't play with the toys much this visit.  We went to gets some cheese for the cheese fair on Wednesday at my daughter's after school program.  So naturally, what would take me five minutes turned into half an hour.  I picked up a pack of Babybel Cheese for the cheese fest and headed to the cashiers.  As usual, there was a longer-than-the-supermarket wait.  It's finally my turn, and I give the cashier my card, and he tells me that it is expired.  "Can we get a manager on aisle 4 please!!"  So the manager comes over, and the cashier pleads my case like a champ, "His card expired and he just wants to get the bag of cheese, he'll renew next time."  I would have renewed then, but, of course, my MasterCard and Visa are no good at Costco.  I have the cash for the cheese, but not for the renewal as well.  The manager looks at my accounts and tells me that it has been expired since May, and that he can't let me buy the cheese.  So apparently my wife and I hadn't been to Costco since before May, but I'm sure it appeared as if I were a serial non-renewer.  That might be plausible if I weren't buying a single 24 pack of Babybels.  Yeah, I'm refusing to renew so that I can buy well priced cheese wrapped in wax.  The wax is actually really cool.  So I lower my head in shame, gather up the kids, leave the cheese, am given back my expired card with a "you don't want to forget this," and head for the door to tell the people who make sure that you aren't shoplifting that there is nothing to check because I couldn't get the cheese for my daughter's cheese tasting.  By the way, I chucked the card because it was obviously the cards fault, or maybe I just didn't want the reminder.

My daughter always gets excited when it is time to go to Snip-Its.  In the past, she loved the stories.  Now, she enjoys playing the games.  I like having entertainment that is not just watching movies or playing Playstation.  The Snip-Its themed characters, shows, and games feel more meaningful.  We bought the first haircut package -- twice.  Although I could do without the candy -- getting a bow, lollipop, and special prize at the end of the haircut is great.  The kids get a card to push it into a slot at the front desk and a prize pops out.  Can I get my haircut here?  We use the hair care products.  The Knot Gene is a life saver.  We just got a mini gene to supplement the full gene.  The shampoo and conditioner seem to have less harmful chemicals than the grocery store products.  My daughter has always loved getting her hair cut.

I eat here regularly with my work lunch pals.  One of them is Vietnamese, so we eat here twice as often as we would otherwise.  So I've tried just about every lunch entr√©e.  The pho is a good choice if you are sick, you are not starving, or you count calories.  I usually order one of the pork items when not relying on the pho.  Our Vietnamese friend orders in a language with limited phonemes and the rest of us order by the easy to use Menu ID system.  We've tried several Vietnamese places in the city and this is the best we've found.  It gets a little busy at lunch, so come early or be prepared for a little wait.

Albeit a bit pricy, the artisan pizzas are the best I've found in Phoenix, which means I'm adding it to the best of Tempe list.  The restaurant has a trendy feel inside and some outdoor seating on a nice patio that faces the parking lot outside.  The only problem is that Picazzo's dropped my favorite pizza.  They went on an organic only binge and a hunt for locally produced ingredients and bye bye to the chipotle barbacoa.  Can I get a moment of silence for the chipotle barbacoa, a spicy pizza with hunks of seasoned beef?  And favorite number two has entered the witness protection program as the menu lists it under a different alias every time I visit.  It was originally called "That's Italian," but now I just order the one with peperoni and salami.  Picazzo's is always running a lot of specials and has a happy hour.  Every week there is special, and they liked to do themes.  During tax season there was some kind of deal where large pizzas cost $10.40.  Oh, the irony.  So get on the mailing list if you like deals.  The bathroom is nice, clean, and worth mentioning in a review.  Unless you have actually tried Picazzo's, I don't even want to hear about how your favorite pizza place it better.  Because it isn't.

Friday,  8:45 AM.  Having dropped off my car down the street I selected Denny's instead of the other fast food options available early in the morning.  I was seated immediately.  The waiter popped by thirty seconds later.  I ordered the Hash Skillet. When did Denny's go to skillets for breakfast.  I love skillets, and, yes, I haven't been in a Denny's in over five years. I took the up sell on the OJ and turned down the extra carbs ( e.g., toast, tortillas).  The food came about two minutes later.  It could be the fastest I've ever received an order from a sit down restaurant.  The bill came quickly after the last bite, and I paid at the cashier's station.  I had a good experience at Denny's and I'm willing to admit it.

Great, easy trail for the whole family.  The trail head isn't too far from the greater Phoenix area on the east side.  The directions to the trail head involve a lot of twists and turns through Gold Canyon, AZ, but it wasn't hard to follow.  (Tip 1. At the time of writing this, the Google Maps location was a little off, but it wasn't hard to find on the Google map.)   The elevation doesn't change much on the walk to the hieroglyphics.  And it is hard to get lost as you can see for miles in any direction for most of the trail.  (Tip 2. Near the end, the trail peters off, but keep going and you'll find one or two pools of water depending on the season.)  There will be more petroglyphs than you an shake a stick at.  It is a really nice ending to a pleasant hike.  However. . .  (Tip 3. If you are more adventurous, you can scale one of the nearby ridges.)  There are no trails beyond the pools, so you will need to rely on your own route finding skills.  I believe that the guide book wanted us to proceed in the direction the trail left off down the valley and then bend up the right along a ridge line.  We took the left ridge, and walked straight up.  The views from the top are spectacular.  This is a good option if you are looking for something more than a family hike.  Again, you are unlikely to get lost as visibility is high in most directions.

My dad would eat here for lunch every day of his visit if he could.  We got him a Groupon as a present, and that makes two visits this trip, which is one less than the last visit.  There's a huge selection of sandwiches.  We like the Knuckle Sandwich best.  The sides are also good.   I'm sure I'll be back a few times once my dad returns for a visit.

Thanksgiving was yesterday, and somehow the Pioneer Living History Village seems like an appropriate Black Friday activity.  I'm thankful that our community puts forth the effort to preserve our history on a 90 acre plot of land that seems further away from Phoenix than it should be, but what I'm most thankful for is that I wasn't born during the nineteenth century.  That's no Yelp people.  Yeah, it's hard to imagine.  And water fountains, I'm thankful for water fountains because I live in Arizona and don't always have a water bottle.  And Thanksgiving leftovers for lunch with my family on a bench in the Pioneer Living History Village, that's nice.  And I'm thankful for the fake man in the outhouse because he was funny.  Thankfully, the need for hand holding and entertaining my six year old daughter as we walked around the village was minimal.  I was a little worried at the start as the Victorian House with a child's room containing toys and a baby's room with dolls and a carriage didn't catch her attention.  Probably because it was a look from the doorway and no touching affair.  However, the blacksmith made a metal hook for hanging clothes right in front of us to demonstrate the forge and then gave it to my daughter; we were set for the rest of the village.  A few lizards and no snakes later, we were doing pretty well.  The cemetery led to some questions about life, or maybe it was death, and we enjoyed seeing the schoolhouse on a non-school day.  How crazy is that?  In case you didn't know, you can't call yourself an Arizonian unless you've attended at least one gunfight, staged or otherwise.  So we waited another 30 minutes to catch the show.  By far the worst gun show I have ever seen, but a gun show nonetheless.  The gun safety talk at the beginning is a nice touch, and at the end of the gun show there is a lot of shooting.  And most of the people seem to be volunteers, so don't give them a hard time.  It's all good fun.  The buildings were restored or recreated, and the restored buildings were moved to the village from various locations (e.g., Phoenix, Glendale, Globe).  So the people who lived in one house were not neighbors with the people in the house next door.  You can only enter most of the buildings when a volunteer is present.  So you may want to go on a day that would be busy, like Black Friday.  And on a final note, the mothballs are to keep the bats away and I'm not even going to tell you what they do to Diet Coke cans.  Okay, I'll tell you.  They shoot them with blanks.  Blam!!  Point blank range.  And then you get the idea that maybe you don't want to take a blank in the chest at point blank range.  And then they tell you that you don't want to take a blank in the chest at point blank range.  That's that gun safety talk I was extolling earlier.

My family and I perform flamenco at Fiesta Mall on occasion.  Fiesta Mall invites various performers on stage over the weekend.  Singers, dancers, a clown, etc.  It's all good wholesome fun for the entire family.  There are also stores and restaurants.  We recently picked up a pair of flamenco shoes for my daughter at one of the various shoe stores.  The reputation for Fiesta seems to be lacking, but there are some good stores.  Best Buy.  Dicks Sporting Goods.  And who doesn't like to stroll through Hot Topic and feel the coolness ooze over yourself.  It is located in Mesa near the 60 freeway.  There's covered parking, and it is not crowded like other malls.

Love this place.  We come a lot for Child's Play and other performances.  We came for a Flamenco performance and two years later the whole family was dancing Flamenco.  Now we perform annually the the TCA.  There is also a great tiny museum to entertain you during intermission or if you arrive early.

While mesmerized by watching my dinner prepared some questions occurred to me.  Does this count as dinner theater?  How much sake can I consume?  Is a beating heart of rice romantic?  Will my wife be distressed because her tofu is where the shrimp was on the grill?  Is it okay to talk with my mouth full when asked a question by the wait staff (he contemplates the answer to this question at all restaurants)?  What is the meaning behind throwing shrimp tails into your hat and front left pocket?  Am I still writing coherently (he'll check later anyway)?  When did my daughter fall asleep on my shoulder?  Is my grandmother-in-law going to pay even though we came for her birthday?  When will the check come?  Answers: definitely, 2/3rd of the bottle, not really, probably, also probably, who knows, also who knows, a little after her bed time but before finishing her homework, she tried, and soon.

In the United States, Mongolian is synonymous with putting uncooked food in a small bowl and handing it over to be cooked on a large metal grill by chefs with huge wooden sticks.  At Genghis Grill, you are directed to have a seat and your food is brought to you.  What separates Genghis from other Mongolian restaurants is that they use this extra time to fully cook the meet and vegetables.  No need for thin strips of meat, and the vegetables are not crunchy.  Cooking the food helps a lot.  I also like the wide variety of meets including marinated steak and sausage.  Yes, sausage.  Adding an egg is a good choice, and I usually favor the peanut sauce with some extra kick.  In the end, it is really your fault if your meal doesn't come out right, and you are allowed a few practice runs to perfect your choices.

Fresh & Easy Neighborhood Market fills the niche of I don't want to spend my entire life shopping for food in a grocery store.  It is a very handy niche to fill.  The store is small, yet has just about everything you need.  There are even pre-made lunches and dinners for a lot cheaper than a restaurant offers.  There's even a section of marked down food that is close to expiring.  Although this section always seems to have some traffic, the rest of the store is rarely busy.  Checkout is self checkout.  Assistance is provided if necessary.   Occasionally, my daughter's school has a fund raiser at Fresh & Easy.  The prices are good.  The name says it all.  What isn't there to love?

Mill Avenue District is the place to be and be seen in Tempe.  The corollary is that it is a good place for people watching . . .  if you like seeing drunk college students.  Yeah, it's Tempe, and it's a college town.  Shopping, dinning, drinking, strolling, and froyo, Mill District has it all in spades.  The new family fav is Canteen.  The fam has also been known to stop in for pizza at Mellow Mushroom and La Bocca.  We've tried the foyo and bought some shoes.  The side walks are wide, the traffic slow, the decorations come out during the holidays, and the parking isn't bad if you know where to look.  Mill has a character and charm all of it own.  And who knows, it might even have a light rail station one day.

Babbo Italian Eatery is a notch above casual dining.  Is that trendy on the rating scale?  At the beginning of the meal, we received some bread pieces with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  If I recall, some shredded cheese was also involved.  We've always been pleased with what was ordered.  I usually have a pasta.  My daughter usually gets a pizza.  And my wife orders something vegetarian.  There is a location near my house, and we visited this location on the way back from Wickenburg.    The service is good and the prices are commensurate with a trendy restaurant.

I entered the cafe for the first time and was unsure of whether to take a seat, so I approached the cash register.  After a period of between five and ten minutes, I placed my order.  After ordering, I was asked whether I wanted fries with my order, and that, my friends, was the first verbal communication I was granted.  In case you missed it, no one spoke to me until after I placed my order.  Not even, what would you like; just a look.  So I took my food to go, and don't plan on returning.  The reuben was actually quite good, but even that does not compel me to give a rating of more than one star.

Love this place, and I'm here on Valentine's Day with the people I love.  Coincidence?  No, you can thank Groupon and the fact that we didn't get a baby sitter, and, did I mention, my wife also loves this place.  What about grandma you ask?  Does she love this place?  Who knows, she's coming anyway.  The menu now indicates such things as gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan for each item.  That's good because I avoid those categories like cooked carrots and water chestnuts.  Orders are served on an arrangement of copper bowls.  The chicken vindaloo is actually a little spicy. Seating is limited, so a reservation is recommended.  I'll see you at The Dhaba.  I just feel cool saying the name. . . to myself as I finish typing this review.

Who reviews a post office?  Lots of people, apparently.  In the past, I would get nervous about going to the post office during or after lunch for fear of spending an eternity in line.  Naturally, I would never make it in line before noon.  But guess what, the line always moves fast.  Wait time is less than ten minutes.  The staff are all very competent.  I've even called a couple of times, and received the same great service.  Visiting the post office turns out to be a very painless experience.  One might even say, "Pleasant."

I eat here regularly with my co-workers for lunch.  We go for one of two reasons.  Reason number 1: we are in the mood for Indian food.  It is the best Indian restaurant near the office.  Reason number 2: we can't think of any other places to eat and we haven't been to the Taj Mahal in three days.  The food is always great.   The lunch special is a good deal.  There is a rotation with three options.  You select your preferred spiciness level, one through ten, and naan or garlic naan.  Lunch also comes with lentil soup and yogurt sauce.

There are many reasons to frequent George's.  The overstuffed gyros come with more meet than a Dagwood sandwich.  The salad comes with more than three vegetables and fresh kalamata olives, not black olives from a can.  The staff is friendly in a local neighborhood joint sort of way.  Don't be fooled by a similarly named establishment on Scottsdale Road, this is the place that was voted Phoenix's best gyro.  I also recommend the chili either on it's own or with fries.

For some reason, I have had the opportunity to admire the inside of SkySong a lot lately, and at various hours.  I agree that SkySong is a great place to have meetings, gatherings, shindigs, and hootenannies which I can attest to on a nearly daily basis.  The outside has many nice features including waterfalls, sidewalks, ample covered parking for those who pay, and a restaurant.  And what research park isn't complete with a shaded intersection.  Actually, the giant sun shade is what gives SkySong so much character.  So when we pass the giant tent, I can tell my daughter, "That's where daddy works." And she says, "I know that already."  Or when I fly in and out of the airport I can point out the window and say to whomever is sitting next to me, "Do you see that giant tent?  That's where I work.  Well, not under the tent, that's just an intersection, but in one of those buildings next to the tent." At night, different hues of light are projected onto the moon shade.  And I am definitely not writing this at work, just like how I never check in on Yelp anywhere near SkySong.

Came with my Vietnamese coworker and friend.  He orders in Vietnamese.  I order using the system by which each dish has a unique number.  The specialty of the house is the fifty or so broken rice dishes and my lunch companion and I decided that "Com Tam something something" shall be known as "Broken Rice" because the actual name is unpronounceable by most Americans and there is already a restaurant in the lunch rotation known as the Vietnamese place.  Did I mention that the coconut water comes in an actually coconut?  Spoon included.  If the large portions don't fill you up, you can gnaw on the coconut meat.  Broken Rice is located next to the entrance of the Mekong Grocery Store opposite UnPHOgettable.  One of the two opted for the American friendly name; both seem authentic to someone who has never set foot in Vietnam, but I did get a peek at the country when I was in Thailand.  One has pho, the other, broken rice, which is about a third the size of regular rice.  Wikipedia says broken rice may or may not be less nutritious than regular rice and that it is less expensive.  My Vietnamese friend says it is less common in Vietnam, and thus fancier, but I can't figure out why.  The main difference is the texture and not the taste, not that I really noticed.  In any case, I recommend all of the broken rice dishes.  I had whatever was suggested by the waiter in lieu of what I ordered, Vietnamese friend not required when ordering.  It had shrimp egg rolls and beef with a heap of broken rice and some veggies.  Soup and a small bowl of fish sauce arrived before the meal.  My Vietnamese friend added some chilly sauce to the fish sauce and spooned some of the mixture onto his meal.  I followed suite.  All in all, I look forward to returning and trying some other numbers.

I've lived in Tempe for about five years, and if you asked me what my favorite restaurant is, I would say The Mission.  If I were to try and pin down the reason for my favorable opinion, it would be something about the entire dining experience.  Located in Old Town Scottsdale, the actual restaurant is an old church.  At least on the outside.  It always feels like a party is happening on the inside.  Indoor and outdoor tables are available.  There is a vast array of margaritas, most come with actual lime juice, and other sundry drinks.    The dinner menu also boasts a myriad of options.  The food is always great.  I'm always trying to decide between several drinks and several entrees.  Although, I usually order several drinks.  The ambiance is festive and loud with dim lighting.  If you want a quieter dining experience, come during the day light hours.  Often, my daughter accompanies us.  There is free parking near by, and a variety of after dinner locations within easy walking distance, such as ice cream parlors.

Who can abstain from visiting Panda Express every now and again?  Most people, but not me.  I need my Chinese food fix every few weeks.  And no other place fills that craving better than Panda Express because there just don't seem to be any other descent Chinese restaurants.  Most Chinese restaurants in Phoenix are terrible with a capital "s", "u", "c", "k", "s".  Panda Express fills the void by offering descent, fast food fare with easy to order combinations.  The Kung Pao actually comes with chili peppers making it spicy and there aren't those large flat misshaped pieces of meat loosely referred to as chicken.  And who doesn't love pandas?  I get the up sale every time just in case the two option plate isn't going to be enough that day.  Or maybe I've just grown too thin like most Americans.  In any case, if you find yourself in Phoenix and that dilapidated Chinese restaurant store front staring you down doesn't look inviting, Panda Express is always just around the corner.

Posh is a dining event.  Instead of ordering off of a menu, you select the number of courses and note any food that you do not like.  Wine pairings are available.  At this point, I just leave everything up to the chef.  My wife is vegetarian, and Posh seems able to adapt to any dining proclivities.  It is hard to remember the dishes as they are all one of a kind.  My wife and I have been twice.  We had a great experience the first time.  I ordered the six course meal and my wife had five courses.  It was by far and away the most expensive meal I have ever paid for.  The tip alone was more expensive then most meals at other restaurants.  The second time we used a Groupon and received ten courses, although I lost count early on.  It was a long meal.  Both times I had raw fish.  I also remember having sea urchin, and my favorite, the ox tail, on our first visit.  Nothing stands out from our second visit.

I arrived Monday afternoon to mail sixteen packages to Arkansas for work.  The line was long and I considered leaving and returning to battle the long line another day.  There were about eight people in front of me.  Seven minutes later I was asking about my mailing options.  I selected priority mail with delivery confirmation as it doesn't require a signature.  Not only was it cheaper than other companies with amazingly similar initials, but it was half the cost we had estimated based on weight and location.  The post office representative had me help by affixing the delivery confirmation stickers and then the priority mail stickers onto the envelops to speed up the process while she entered the packages into the system.  Another seven minutes later I was done.  I'm just going to say it.  I had great service at the post office.  I've been back several times to mail packages to Arkansas.  All the employees are very competent.  Today, an older woman wanted them to track down a letter she sent with a check.  She was concerned because the letter didn't have a return address.  Not sure how that turned out, but the long line melted away in no time again.

Tubing for a drip system in my garden is not in gardening; it's in plumbing.  I guess that makes sense as I'm putting a plumbing system in my garden, or at least my wife is.  Light bulbs are not in lighting; they are in a separate light bulb section.  Not sure how to rationalize that one, but changing light bulbs is all me, in case you were wondering.  And so it goes in the aisles of Lowes that feel more like a maze with dead ends, trick turns, and no end in sight.  I would end up blaming myself if customer service weren't lacking.  It seems to be hit or miss with few hits.  The best thing Lowes has going is a convenient location.

Came because the Best of Phoenix issue told me to.  After contemplating whether to take my daughter to the restaurant next to Club Tattoo, we entered the cleanest restaurant I've ever seen.  I think it is supposed to look like a dive with bricks showing through the walls, but it is just too clean.  The chips were fresh and salty and the salsa was runny and spicy; both delicious.  I order the pollo fundido to see what a fundido is.  After filling up on chips, my daughter ate one-fourth of my fundido (sans pollo because she is vegetarian), her beans, and none of her quesadilla.  The guacamole was fresh and the other three-fourths of the fundido tasted great.  The service was also great.  So if you are looking for some delicious, inexpensive Mexican food served really fast and in a clean restaurant, Moreno is your grill.

We had a Groupon for this sushi place that I had been trying to get my wife to go to.  She bought the Groupon!?  But we had just had sushi.  So, naturally, we drove there and ended up at The Living Room.  They seemed rather busy for a Thursday night, so we opted to sit outside, immediately.  The sun was low and the misters were raining down cool moisture.  Two chairs were arranged around an end table and, later, a second end table was added.  I hope you see where this is going.  It actually felt as if we were eating dinner at a party in someone's living room.  The service seemed good when you accounted for the deluge of patrons.  I'm not sure if this was a typical Thursday.  I saw our waitress hustling inside and outside with plates and cutting boards being used as plates.  We had some wine, the olive appetizer, and four bruschetta on a cutting board.  All was good.  The menu is long on the wine and beer, and boasts a variety of appetizers, bruschetta, salads, sandwiches, and desserts.  Near the end of our dinner, the music turned county and we hightailed it out of there.

Another location, another ode to Chipotle  Burrito, burrito bowl, quesadilla, or taco Barbacoa, steak, carnitas, chicken, or veggie Black beans or pinto beans Spicy, corn, medium, pico de gallo, or a mixture Something for the whole family.   Instead of yellowed Spanish rice Actual white Mexican-style rice with a hint of cilantro and lime And. . . Brown rice for the health conscious Something for everyone.  How come it's soooooo good!?  Tin foil, talkative cups, and gregarious wrappers What's up with the narcissistic pictures? Lots of metal and wood You know when you walk into a Chipotle  There is always a Chipotle near by, but. . .  Why aren't there more Chipotles!?

What makes this place special is the salsa bar like none other.  Some are good on the complimentary chips; others are good with your order.  It's up to you to find out.  The oversized paintings reminiscent of Kahlo and Rivera adorn the walls.  Frida and Diego also appear in the pictures, and, yes, we're on a first name basis.  The restaurant was just about empty when we entered on a Friday night.  Hopefully, this was because it is new.  Pssst, you're missing out.  I had fish tacos and my Frida had some vegetarian dish.  Both of us were very happy.  They didn't have margaritas, just beer.  But I keep trying to order a margarita every time I go for good measure.

The new closest Stride Rite location is at San Tan now that the Chandler Fashion Square location vanished.  Stride Rite offers a wide range of fashionable, sturdy shoes.  My daughter has recently outgrown the princess collection, but still likes to have charms hanging from the laces.  I showed her the boys shoes and we had a good chuckle.  Six of them had the face of Spiderman across the front.  I wonder if the parents of the boys laugh at the girl's shoes.  We picked up a pair of water shoes and some shiny fancy white shoes with a small heal.  Naturally, she wanted another pair of running shoes while we were at the shoe store, but I told her we would wait for the next sale.  The current sale was BOGO 50 percent.  The April sale is is a scratch off game with up to 60 percent off.  We got 30 percent off.  There always seems to be a sale going on.  For a while, we were using the stink spray regularly when my daughter would go sockless.  Luckily, the socks are back on.

I read that the service was poor, and, my fellow Yelpers, you don't lie.  We were greeted with a generous helping of silence, followed by disbelief when my friends tried to order off the menu for lunch.  I can't take them anywhere, but it was my fault, I know that they won't do a buffet.  So, after being told that it would take a while, we were informed that the gyro would not be coming.  After that, my friends watched me enjoy the buffet, which was followed by my friend who was now on a forced diet because his gyro didn't make it and me watching friend number two eat.  The food is actually good, and I love buffets, but I don't think we'll be going back.

Great Clips for Hair is the place where I get most of my hair cuts because they meet the follow qualifications.  The number one reason is that the location is near my house, and I am sure that this is a very helpful tidbit for you to read.  But if the other qualifications were not true, I would have probably moved on to the next most convenient hair cutting location.  The staff displays great customer service, in what is one of the most customer service focused jobs I can think of.  In fact, I've had some meaningful conversations with the staff, including one on the fact that the job is customer service driven.  There is usually no wait, and if there is a wait, it is usually very short.  Not only is the location near my house, but it is in a strip mall with several casual dining establishments next door, Subway and China Panda.  Now that Panda Express is on Yelp and I can check in there, I can resume my patronage of their establishment.  With food nearby, I can get a haircut, and then because it is late, get some food to eat at home in front of the TV.  The price at Great Clips for Hair is also great.  And the haircuts are good, too; that should probably be higher on the list, first or second, not sure.  By the way, why is it Great Clips for Hair?  I'm not aware of the non-hair Great Clips.

It is refreshing to be the recipient of some good customer service.  When you try a new place, you want to feel welcome.  (Note. If you prefer to feel unwelcome, see my review on Temptations Cafe.). I believe that if I would have walked in and said that I thought that they had a buffet on Tuesdays, the cashier/waiter would have immediately said, "Why didn't you say so earlier?" I had the chicken shawarma entree.  It was really good in a good way.  Juicy with good chicken shawarma sauce.  A tahini yogurt something maybe.  It was undercrowded, so I hope that it become more popular with locals.  Come on Whole Fooders, its right next store.

Otherwise known as the Thai place, we come a lot and have witnessed first hand the ongoing saga of Lao Thai from the road construction to the recent revival.  Through the lack of staff, changing recipes, and loyalty cards, Lao Thai has emerged as a great lunch spot.  In close proximity to my office, we come about once every other week.  I order either the green curry or drunken noodles depending on my mood.  Both are good.  One of my friends always gets the chicken fried rice.  I assume it is good as well.  We both add extra spice.  The outside looks like a strip mall, and is not that inviting.  Don't be fooled.  Inside the corner spot is an actual Thai restaurant.

I had to eat here at least once, and would eat here more often if it were in a more convenient location for me.  Have you ever wanted to try real ramen?  News flash -- the 99 cent packages of "ramen" at the grocery store is just about one of the worst things you can stick into you body and can hardly be called food at all.  If you feel insulted by this sentence, then I would not recommend Republic Ramen + Noodles, but if you were intrigued by my question, look up the address immediately.  Besides, and I haven't done extensive research on this, but I believe that instant ramen in Japan comes with the broth, which leads me to believe that they don't even have what we call "ramen" in Japan.  For those who are neither insulted nor intrigued, just keep in mind that you are ordering soup for your meal.  If that won't fill you up, consider an appetizer.  There are a variety of styles and ingredients that you must select from.  Naturally, I ordered naruto with my ramen.  The reason for this will be left unpublished.  All that is missing is counter side dining with privacy drapes.

The best burger in Phoenix.  Reminds me of how Five Guys Burgers and Fries used to be.  The smashburger and smashchicken (fried) are delicious.  Ever since ordering the haystack straws, I've never been able to muster up the motivation try the fries.  You'll have to wait for your burger or chicken because they make it to order.  That's a good thing, by the way.  And, in case the name of the restaurant did not tip you off, yes, I will confirm it in all sincerity, smashburger is not the place to go if you are on a diet.

I spent a week in Spain, which makes me an expert on Spanish cuisine.  I spent most of my time in Seville, which in no way limits my knowledge of the cuisine as Seville has great food.  Tapas Papa Frita oozes good food in sauces, creams, and oil.  I like to order plates with sausage.  The menu discloses the origin in Spain of each dish.  The vegetarian tapas include the standard fair with patatas bravas, tortilla de patatas, which was tortilla espa√±ola in Spain, and miarmones.  The soups were okay and the gazpacho was nothing special.  The meat was great, and I couldn't stop eating those small plates.  The decor feels luxurious with a giant wooden door as the entrance and a giant wax candle that greets you at the entrance.  The ambiance indoors exudes a street cafe feel with mini trees, votives, a stone like floor, lantern candle holders, and an arched partition between the inner and outer dining areas.  The large window into the kitchen is also a nice touch.  Somehow, I feel like I can trust the food more even though I hardly pay attention to what is actually going on in the kitchen.  We came to see Yumi La Rosa dance and she had the other two males in my party and I perform a flamenco bull fighter dance on stage.  On the edge of Old Town, the restaurant is located next to the Scottsdale "waterfront," a canal that cuts through the city.  When you're in the Phoenix area, I guess that's the best you can do for eating at the waterfront.  Great restaurant and a nice area of Scottsdale.

This review is dedicated to lunch buddy, Eli M., who doesn't remember the first time he visited Cafe Martha.  By the way, throwing away your basket with your other trash at Cafe Martha shall now be called pulling an Eli.  Come on man, don't you remember now!?  Good food?  Yes, come for the food.  There is only one other good reason to come.  They have mostly sandwiches, and the sandwiches are good.  I usually don't like slaw, but the olive slaw has the right amount of olive taste to make it tasty.  And I don't know what it is about those puff chips, but I can't get enough of them.  As a small side comes with your sandwich, you may not need to get the chips.  They also offer a meal deal.  And there are salads and soups.    Good service?  Uh . . . the first time we came my friend, who shall remain nameless because this review isn't dedicated to him, announced that it was our first time and asked what was good.  He got a nice glare that said, "Stop hassling me and just pick something."  It feels like you are that college kid returning home just for a quick bite because you're too lazy to make something for yourself, and you get the apathetic pleasantries with a homey touch.  Atmosphere?  Uh . . . tucked on the edge of Old Town Scottsdale and off the beaten path, it has a provincial, small town cafe feel with a hint of charm.  Chalkboards and whiteboards proclaim the menu and encircle the counter where you place your order.  Off to the left is the seating area.  It is unclear whether you are supposed to leave your basket on the table or place it on the counter, and sometimes people pull an Eli before they place their empty basket back on the counter.  Coupons?  Yes, and that is the other reason to come.  There are lots of them, and they remind us that it is time to visit Martha once again.

Somehow my family always winds up at the Brick after visiting the Science Center.  It is a pleasant walk from Heritage and Science Park to the Arizona Center where the Brick is located.  Last visit, the kids sat at the table with the couch and ordered on their own, mostly, and the adults had some grownup time.  They were eight years old and the waitress was very accommodating about this arrangement.  The restaurant satisfies the kids and the adults.  There is pizza and there is adult friendly pizza. And there is water and there is wine and beer.  There are also salads and burgers.  I recommend checking out the appetizers and small plates.  We usually get something to share with the table.

The Buffalo serves wings, boneless wings, boneless wings sandwiches, and salads that can be ordered with or without wings.  I like my wings with the bone, otherwise known as tradition wings.  There are some twenty odd flavors.  Currently, I get half hot and half Thai curry.  Top that off with some fries, ketchup, carrots, and blue cheese and you've got yourself a lunch special.  The loyalty card is a nice perk, $5 off every few meals or so.  The servers are very generous with the punches.  And if I ever managed to fill out the survey from the receipt, I would be saving even more moolah.  For a little bit, I was using SCVNGR to unlock some deals.  It is an app that requires you to complete challenges, and if you get enough points, you can unlock deals.  It was fun for a few weeks, but then seemed like a lot of work.  They've also got drinks, but come on, man, this is my lunch break.

The first thing I want you to know about this place is that my eighty-six year old grandmother-in-law gave it her stamp of approval and said that we are coming back.  I don't know if it was the two margaritas she had that led to this remark, but the rest of the table agreed.  Happy hour works well if you order too much food and don't want to feel guilty about it.  Yeah, I'm a guy and am talking about paying for food that I was eating after I was full because I ordered it.  Isn't that an obligation if you want to remain a man?  The wait staff put up with my family with a smile.  Who knows?  The hidden gem on the menu was the cup of corn.  I wish I would have ordered it instead of a round of chicken tacos after having had the ribs and fish tacos.  I just have trouble ordering items with no meat.  The margaritas are highly recommended.  The Paloma was especially good.

I drove by this place yesterday, which made it the perfect place to visit today.  I've been looking for some Chinese that is better than China Panda.  Although I set the bar low, I've been having trouble surpassing it for the last two years since I moved to Phoenix.   Would my search for good Chinese food within the confines of the greater Phoenix area come to an end at Jimmy Woo's?  I have some bad news, my lunch buddy is cheating me with work outs and other friends.  So I've been eating solo on occasion.  On a mission, as always, I arrived alone.  The Egg Drop soup was just like every Egg Drop Soup I've ever had.  I'm not sure that it is even worth the effort of making, but I ate it anyway.  What can I say, I was alone and vulnerable.  I also ordered a coke even though I didn't want any because Jimmy Woo's seemed too fancy to say, " No, I'll just have a water.". The egg roll might just be the best egg roll I've ever had.  It was fat, flaky, and filled with the right amount of meat.  I had almost given up on my favorite Chinese dish -- Kung Pao.  On a whim, I got it with beef instead of chicken, the way I have ordered since I could order my own meals.  Definitely better than China Panda, and actually quite good.  The beef was great.  And I was able to order it without water chestnuts as they list the ingredients on the menu and will remove them upon request.  FYI, not only do water chestnuts lack flavor, but I'm not even sure if they are really food.  I ate too many chili peppers up front, and had to douse the tongue with coke.  I don't eat fortune cookies, and the service was polite, even though I was alone.  Sure, you pay more for eating in downtown Scottsdale at restaurant with patio seating, a fancy bar, wrap around couch booths, an open kitchen, and sparkly, red table tops.  But to have decent Chinese food that is actually quite good in the Phoenix area, that is worth a slightly higher price.

Great pick for my wife's birthday dinner.  We've always wanted to try the Herb Box and found a great occasion.  The menu offers a wide range of foodie friendly comfort food that will satisfy the vegetarian and omnivore alike.  There was also a good list of mixed drinks.  I would recommend the sangria over the mojito.  I had the ribs and macaroni and cheese with bread crumbs.  The bread crumbs make it fancy.  There is some great outdoor seating when the weather is accommodating.  The restaurant is on the Scottsdale waterfront.  I don't quite get the fake herbs as a center piece of each table, but the restaurant does seem to be surrounded by an herb garden.  There's a bakery down stairs that makes some of the menu items.  I'm sure we'll be back, and may even take the parents next time they are in town, if you get my drift.

We had a friend coming into town and my wife booked the trip not realizing how far Wikenburg is from Phoenix.  We made the drive and weren't disappointed.  Once my daughter turned six we went on a few horseback riding adventures.  Based on these experiences, I can say that Cowboy Way Adventures is a professional outfit.  We were greeted by a cowgirl, who I wish would have lead out trip as it was nice for my daughter to meet a non-male cowperson.  We walked around the nearby washes, and up and down some of the horse trails.  As usual, I got one of the ornery horses, which turned out to be rather docile compared to the ornery horses I usually get.  If you are new or a child, they give you a docile horse.  I was warned that my horse might lie down in the sand on the way back, which I thought would be funny, but this never happened.  No doubt, it was my riding skill.  On past trips, the horses would go for the vegetation the entire trip.  This seemed a lot rarer with the Cowboy Way horses.  Before heading back, the trip leader had my daughter get her horse to trot.  She loved it, and smiles when we talk about it.  Although he kept a close watch over her, I felt like she was starting to learn the basics of directing her horse.  Cowboy Way offers a variety of trips including moon light rides, dinners, and overnight excursions.  I see another trip to Wikenburg in our near future.

When I'm craving falafel, I head over to Tsom plus or minus the vegetarian members of my family.  Tsom sports an unpretentious interior decorated with live plants, a salad bar, and a falafel topping station.  Vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, raw diet, or just looking for something a little healthier, Tsom's got you covered.  One day I will have to brave the raw bar, but so far, I haven't been able to order anything beyond the falafel.  I usually add a shake or smoothie with my lunch order, and I'm good till dinner.  I recommend both the Mango Mamma and Almond Milkshake.  A haven of healthy options, it's nice to feel good about your selection when eating out.

Mellow Mushroom keeps the consumption of pizza interesting in a casual, laid-back atmosphere.  Pizza joints are a dime a dozen in the United States, and I experience a serious amount of pizza consumption fatigue as mushroom pizza has become a food group in my family.  Enter Mellow Mushroom, stage left.  We've been enjoying Mellow Mushroom since our days in Georgia and were delighted to find a location opening up in the trendy Mill district of Tempe.  (Well, trendy for Tempe.)  I usually find a few pizzas that I'm interested in trying when reviewing the menu.  Having good bear helps as well.

At this point, Zoyo seems like the last yogurt stand still standing within a one mile radius of my house.  All of my favorites have closed.  So Zoyo is now my second favorite froyo.  Don't get me wrong, I've always liked Zoyo.  It has a local, neighborhood kind a feel.  There's a large, windowed garage door that opens temperature permitting.  When open, Zoyo emits a breezy, carefree vibe.  Kind of like the staff.  It is conveniently located in a strip mall next to Rubios and the pizza place.  The choice of yogurt is the standard with a few tarts, a few non-tarts, and some ice cream like flavors.  There's always a lot of candy toppings, and never a shortage of syrups.  Personally, I prefer the fruit, and here Zoyo is hit or miss.  Sometimes there is ample fresh fruit; sometimes, I am left wondering where it all went.  As Zoyo is biking distance from my house, it could easily nudge into the number one fav spot.  But the lack of fruit on some occasions knocks it down a notch.

The Disney Store is our go to store when we have time to kill or need a break from shopping at Stride Rite and Gymboree.  The Disney Store seems to be slowly morphing into the Magic Kingdom with tunnels through plush toy displays, a tunnel through a princess castle, and my favorite, the tree and obscures section of a wall that proudly displays animation sequences.  There is also a coloring area complete with Disney Movie.  Some training is provided by animators.  Funny thing about the movie, I didn't see any DVDs for sale.  Just plush toys, more toys, Cars toys, Marvel toys, some collectibles, lots of diaries, and clothes.  Or were those journals.  There are also suitcases.  Hint, hint!!

There seems to be three types of pizza.  Chicago style, New York style, and the pizza that we actually buy and eat.  These days you go to a pizza joint and ask for thin crust and they say, "Sure, we've got non-existent crust."  And you say, "Yeah, I'll get the non-existent crust." Maybe I'm watching my weight; maybe I just don't like that much bread underneath my cheese; maybe it's none of your business.  And they say, "Yeah, that's good because our crust sucks." So it's great that there's actually a pizza joint where I can get some crust with character - crust with taste.  And the fact that I can get a slightly healthier pizza for my daughter is a plus that is hard to pass up as she could live off of pizza if one could actually live off of eating only mushroom pizza.  How a five-year old ever convinced herself to like mushrooms I'll never know.  My wife loves the skinny pizza with pineapple, feta cheese, hold the mozzarella, jalapenos, and onions.  Yeah, I know, that pizza makes even less sense than a five year old eating mushrooms.  Personally, I'm settling on a peperoni and basil combo with full crust.

With frozen yogurt a five minute drive in any direction, we definitely needed one in walking distance.  Channeling our favorite yogurt stop that had died a year ago, Yoppi Frozen Yogurt opened two days ago and maintains many Japanese accoutrements like Swirl . . . oh, poor Swirl.  Why the health code violations?  I digress.  Yoppi Frozen Yogurt offers many types of mochi, lots of molded plastic, smiling Yoppi girls, a sun glassed dude, smiling stars, and some kind of lychee yogurt popper that must have a really cool Japanese name, but I don't know what it is.  I love tart flavors and they have a record four, and you get to vote on a new flavor.  So I'm looking forward to five tart flavors with the addition of passion fruit tart.  The pomegranate tart was my favorite this time, and there was a lot of fruit including blue berries, finely chopped strawberries, mango, and maraschino cherries.  The staff was very friendly and let us try the yogurt and the toppings.  My daughter enjoyed trying lots of toppings.  Although this was our first visit, I think that we might be regulars.

What a great name for a restaurant in my biased opinion.  I've tried to come to Mark's Cafe several times, and have failed.  Maybe it was for dinner, a Monday, a Tuesday, or that two weeks when everyone went on vacation.  But I never gave up.  I was on a mission to try this local favorite.  And I knew today was the day.  It was even getting close to the 2 pm close time.  But I was determined.  Luckily, no secret hand signal was needed to enter.  It was Feb. 14th and the cafe was decorated for Valentine's Day, not with something corporate concocted with branding and mailed over, but by a real human being who went to the store to buy supplies.  It was a really nice touch.  I ordered the cajun chicken club.  I was in the mood for a club, and I wanted to put Mark's Cafe to the test.  It is easy to make a bland club sandwich.  I also ordered the fries instead of the chips.  The fries were of the fresh cut variety.  And a small plastic jar with a spoon and ketchup was presented with the fries.  The sandwich was really good.  The chicken was moist and coated with Cajun spices, which was complimented well by the lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise.  The bacon completed the sandwich.  The server was attentive and stopped by a few times.  Mark could be seen loitering around.  I was there past 2 pm, but no mention of this was made.  If you are looking for that local feel, Mark's Cafe is your restaurant.

After my last two favs went out of business, this is the new go to place for Froyo.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Orange Leaf, it's just not as close to my house as the other two favs.  This is a destination location, meaning we're on a mission for yogurt when we come.  I guess I'm a little tarted out because I'm really enjoying the white chocolate strawberry and forgoing all tart flavors.  The strawberry cheesecake is also good, but not as good as the white chocolate.   Also, the fruit is always fresh.  This is key for taste and makes my dessert super healthy.  The decor is very trendy and orange, naturally.  The TVs are a big hit with the kids, and the background music is a nice touch.  There always seem to be a few patrons, but also a few available seats for us.

Wait, did Green open up another restaurant in Phoenix?  Like many of you, I was overjoyed to utter that wholly unexpected turn of events.  Am I in a giant garage?  There's a hangar door for a narrow, long car.  I suspect this set-up works well when it is warm, but not hot, and you want to eat outside.  Or eat on the edge of being outside, but remain inside.  You get to choose how close to being outside you want to be without actually being outside.  The way I see, Green is a great restaurant and it happens to be vegetarian/vegan.  Where Green surpasses other restaurants is flavor.  The salad, the most neglected item on every other menu-- flavorful.  Other menu items -- flavorful.  Did I mention that I like meat?  If you are answering, "no?", then you need to read some of my other reviews.  And feel free to endorse them as funny or cool.  The answer is yes, people.  The reason I like Green is because what I like even more is good food.  This incarnation of Green has an artsy (in a good way), trendy, causal kind of feel.  There's folksy art on the walls available for purchase, and am in a hangar for mini airplanes?  There's also the companion coffee-dessert shop next door, called Nami.  It is where you get the Tsoynami.  If you don't know what that is, maybe it's time to find out.

Came here on a long lunch break.  Three out of the three Turks with us agreed that Turkish Kitchen is the most authentic Turkish restaurant in the greater Phoenix area.  One had said Arizona, but admitted that he hadn't really visited every Turkish restaurant in this great state.  After eating some types of Asian food, Turkey is mostly in Asia if you didn't know, I am usually hungry after a few hours.  This is especially true with Chinese food, some Japanese food, but not Thai food.  Thais doesn't hold back on the coconut milk.  Having ordered iskender kebab, I experienced much the opposite.  The dish is serve hot with the kebab meat (beef, lamb, both - who knows?) served above pide bread soaking in yogurt, tomato sauce, and the kebab meat juices.  There are no sticks; order a different kebab if you must eat you're your meat on a stick.  Naturally, I ordered the large portion and never looked back.  In fact, I couldn't help myself and felt rather good after finishing my rather large lunch.  So I ordered revani, baked dessert bread infused with syrup.  And did I mention the appetizers: acili ezme (a symphony of blended summer vegetables drizzled with olive oil and finished with herbs and spices), patlican soslu (the eggplant version of acili ezme), and our meals came with some kind of side sauce that defies description because I'm not sure which one it is on the online menu.  On the other hand, I only had water because I'm watching my weight and avoiding soft drinks.  After lunch, we drove back to work, and I tried to remember all the things I was supposed to be doing.  After about an hour or so, I started to feel really full, and that I should stop eating, except, I had stopped about an hour ago.  After another hour, I was ready for a long nap.  A few more hours later, I rolled myself into my car and drove home.

Another Chipotle  Another place to fall back on when your original plans fall through (the wait was too long across the parking lot). Another location in the strategic grid of quick bites that always satisfy the whole family. Another chance to have a burrito with barbacoa, brown rice, pinto beans, corn and hot salsa, sour cream, and that's it. Another chance for my wife to decide between a burrito or a veggie bowl. Another change for my daughter to have three kids quesadillas.  Maybe she needs an adult meal. Another chance to read about the most recent locally bought, sustainable purchasing plan off of a cup. Another change to try and figure out what the black and white pictures mean, and to interpret the message behind the wood and metal sculptures. Another opportunity to have a great meal.

Barrio Queen is in Old Town Scottsdale near the "waterfront."  The restaurant occupies a relatively small space compared to its neighbors and is connected to Silvana Bistro.  We sat at the table facing the entrance with the Jose Cuervo mirrored sign, stylized hood cover from a car, and three tequila certificates.  The Don Julio print on the paper place maps seemed to indicate that there was some descent tequila served at Barrio Queen.  We enjoyed the simple three margarita with the Don that arrived in a plastic Pacifico pitcher.  My daughter had a cheese and mushroom quesadilla. Thick with cheese, mushrooms, and onions she got past the blueness of the blue corn tortilla and the onions, and consumed all of it.  The guacamole came chunky, spicy, and highly recommended by our waiter.  We polished it off quickly, still hungry.  Near our seats were black and white Barrio Queen shirts and food stuffs in cages.  The draft from the door was cold and unrelenting as patrons entered and exited.  Within site of our table was a Frida Khaloesque painting that had been Barrio Queened, a monitor with a slide show of employees, ingredients, and food, and a bar with pastries, caged liquor, and beers on tap and in a refrigerator.  The primary item, fifty of them, are fancy street tacos.  Each is a single, but everyone's order comes on their own plates.  I highly recommend the barrio pollo y chorizo.  The chorizo was really good.  The chorizo y al pastor was good and the cameron con coco was okay.  Four tacos and some of an appetizer seemed to be enough for a meal.  Adding some dessert was too much.  The churro was something to behold as it was topped with caramel and ice cream.

Early on, I asked City Market why they weren't on Yelp.  The immediate reply was, "What is Yelp?"  After trying to explain everything that Yelp is, I was given the brush off.  And now they are promoting some kind off Yelp wannabe.  Well, too bad City Market, I've added you to Yelp and this is your review.  I even added a business photo; it's not bad.  The sandwiches are good and there's a nice variety.  They run daily specials with a drink, and the menu is presented on flat screen TVs.  And not too long ago they dropped their prices.  Bores Head products are a big deal.   They also offer some convenience store items.  The main reason I go is because it is about forty feet from my office.  Everyone goes to City Market when time is short or they are being lazy.  City Market is located In SkySong, and isn't visible from the street.  Other than the denizens of SkySong, I wonder who else comes, especially with the delay of a page on Yelp.

I purchased two Groupons as Devil Hotz is near my work and I could convince the lunch crew to give it a try.  At first when we arrived, the crew was excited.  The devil plates are a unique arrangement of food, and everyone got their pick.  I ordered the hot sausage plate, which comes in a styrofoam to go box with macaroni salad and hash browns on the bottom topped by chili, sausage, mustard, onions, and green chilies.  The others ordered similar devil plates, and the initial enthusiasm quickly faded.  The hash browns were under cooked.  We were told that this was impossible and served some more under cooked hash browns.  Apparently, the hash browns are purchased pre-cooked and the fried, except that they aren't fully pre-cooked.  I guess having the cook try the food before serving it is poor form at Devil Hotz.  The prices are low because the ingredients are low quality.  The bacon cheese fries are pretty awful.  And so I am now sitting alone, typing this review, and eating $15 worth of food and drink.  The moral of the story is don't get two Groupons!!

A new Indian restaurant just opened near my house, and we decided to walk on over.  Yeah, that close.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly, and there were a few other patrons trying out the new place for the first time.  I was very excited to see that they have a buffet, and filled my plate with a thin layer of rice topped by four of the meat curry dishes.  I added some of the mint chutney for good measure.  It was a work of art.  Warm garlic naan arrived not long after we started taking our first bites.  And just before my daughter said that it was too garlicky, the warm plain naan arrived.  Yes, before.  And before I could start thinking about seconds, actually I had already planned on seconds while pilling on the firsts, a steaming hot plate of chicken biryani with a few mixed vegetables arrived just for me as part of the buffet.  Did I mention that everyone else in my party is vegetarian?  After joining the clean plate club and then having two pieces of chicken to boot, I was done, but not past done like my wife was advertising.  And then I tried some of the dessert, but I was still at done.  While paying the bill, they gave me a to go box for the chicken biryani.  How great is that? Suffice to say that the food was great, the service was great, and we'll be back - often.

An oasis of quiet and solitude in the din and hustle of the airport.  I came bearing my young daughter, wife, and myself in need of a brief respite before boarding the next plane in our journey.  We enter with raised levels of stress.  The club room offers rooms of comfortable chairs, modest snacks that feel like a meal, a clean bathroom, and a well stocked bar.  The staff were conscientious and kind.  Magazines I've never heard of on business and technology were lying around every where.  We relaxed and left prepared for the next leg of our journey.

First, Al Moro.  Then, Silk Road.  Now, Studios 806.  Why all the name changes? I couldn't tell you.  The dance studios have remained a great place to practice your style of dance.  For diversion, there are pictures by local artist for sale on the walls outside the studios.  The studios themselves feel professional with hard wood floors and huge mirrors.  In the studio we practice in is a beautiful mural on the back wall.  I train with Yumi La Rosa. I have been with Yumi since traveling to Spain with her about one and a half years ago.  My daughter joined shortly before the trip and my wife joined a year or two before either of us.  We all love practicing and performing with Yumi.  Yumi produces a show with Ava, who is the owner of the studios in the Spring at Tempe center for the Arts called Mujeres.  Ava teaches belly dancing.  I enjoy seeing the belly dancing numbers at Mujeres.  There are three dance studios at Studios 806.  During my daughter's class is a burlesque class.  I like listening to the music emanating from the room as I wait for my daughter's class.  If you are interested in learning a style of dance, I would recommend seeing what is available at Studios 806.

Crepe Bar is one of those unassuming cafes you drive by all the time and contemplate visiting, but never have.  The exterior is a strip mall without any anchor stores to draw you in. The gas station is there for a quick fill up and reminder that you still have never been to the Crepe Bar.  The interior is Spartan with small tables and metal chairs with cushions and high tops with matching metal stools.  The cash register is an iPad, and the tip jar is a pint glass.  There is also an artful flower arrangement on the counter with birds of paradise, and a cooler with cold drinks off to the side.  Some sweet treats beckon customers from the counter.  There also appears to be a rack with shirts near the entrance for sale.  The menu is also Spartan with a small variety of breakfast, lunch, and desert crepes.  There seem to be as many coffee and tea drinks as crepes, although you can also build your own crepe.  At lunch time on Friday and the place was busy.  I ordered the buffalo chicken.  It was good.  I'll have to try one of the desert crepes.

I've driven past Los Dos Molinos many times and always wanted to go in.  Finally finding the opportunity to try the food, my daughter and I ventured in and found a table.  We were well attended during our visit.  Two salsas arrived at our table -- green and red.  The red is the hotter of the two, and both have substance.  I ordered the green chili enchiladas because green chili is spicier than red chili, and who doesn't like enchiladas.  It came with an egg sunny side up.  I would add an egg to the top of most my meals if I could, so it is nice that I didn't need to place a special request.  My daughter had her usual cheese and bean burrito.  At Los Dos Molinos, it is called a burro.  We both enjoyed our meals.  The restaurant layout invite patrons to return during the warm, but not hot months of the year.  The doors were left open and there is a patio out back for dining and the consumption of alcohol.

Came for lunch and had the typical buffet fare.  There was a vast array of food available with curries, dosas, white rice, rice with chicken, salad, some items I didn't recognize, some items I don't remember, melon, salad, mango custard, rice pudding, etc.  There was a good mixture of vegetarian and meat options.  The nan was toasty.  All three of us had one plate to many of food.

Hummus Express has the feel of a neighborhood cafe with more authentic fare. I come here on about a weekly basis. By far the best gyro meat I've ever had. Apparently, the trick is to marinate. I usually get a bowl, which seems quite reasonable price-wise given the amount of food. I am also quite fond of the grilled eggplant.

Tumbleweed Park's Playtopia is the bestest playground in all of Phoenix.  Although it may be a little out of the way in Chandler, your children will thank you for making the drive.  Tumbleweed park is already a rather large green space with a recreational center that boasts a pool, some sports fields, and smack dab in the middle is Playtopia.  A playground so big, that it has been partitioned into three themes areas: (1) Farm Land, (2) City Land, (3) and Critter Land.  Farm Land is the biggest, and offers your typical brightly colored, metal and plastic play structure geared to the five and older crowd.  The best part, Farmland has a giant sun shade.  City Land has streets for bikes and scooters, smaller play structures for younger tykes, and single rider vehicles that use a spring for locomotion.  In Critter Land, you'll find a massive Gila Monster, a giant shell worth exploring, an archaeological dig, some climbing rocks, and the sand box.  So, don't forget those rarely used shovels and buckets.  There are also swing sets around Playtopia and pavilions of various sizes open for rent.  The bathroom is nearby and there are several parking lots around the park.  When you can see the giant sun shade near a parking lot, find a space.

The go to Thai restaurant now has a cool sounding name.  Come on people -- Thailicious.  Thailicious has all of the standard fare in varying degrees of spiciness.  We usually order our food to go.  I can attest to the Green Curry and Drunken Noodles being good.  The location is in a strip mall with ample parking near Walgreens and Fresh and Easy.

Best BBQ in Phoenix. I suspect it could also be the best in Arizona and even in the Southwest. I've seen Little Miss BBQ appear on top ten lists for the US. I find it comical that many chains have interior designs with faux outdoor seating as if you are at a picnic by the smokers, when that is actually what the seating is at Little Miss BBQ. The brisket is melt it your mouth tender. You can't go wrong with any of the meat options. I also recommend the beans and grits as sides.  Each trip is an experience. I recommend arriving early before opening time to get the best cuts. I usually arrive at 10:45 AM and wait about half an hour after they open at 11 AM. The first time I came I arrived much later to a really long line and waited two hours, but it was worth it.

I recommend ordering a pound of fresh seafood and 1-2 potatoes and 1-2 corns.  I'm from New Orleans and had to try the crawfish.  Unfortunately, they were out of fresh crawfish during crawfish season.  Tried the clams.  They come with the shells, which works well for scooping up the seasoning.  I opted out of getting the gloves.  They weren't needed.  I also didn't use the bib and my shirt survived.  Extra spicy is nose running, tongue burning, eye watering hot or just about right.  The Hot n Juicy seasoning hit the spot.  I'll be bak to try the fresh crawfish.
