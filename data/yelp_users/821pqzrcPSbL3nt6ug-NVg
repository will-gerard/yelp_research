I am a salsa fanatic-- I eat salsa with a spoon as if it were gazpacho.  Milk Depot has the best salsa in the valley of the sun.  32oz of fresh salsa is $4.50.  Amazing!  You can drive through or walk up.

The only redeeming thing about Rositas is the free chips and salsa.  I grew up coming here all the time but my family switched to a different Mexican restaurant due to the mediocre food served here.  If I am craving salsa I stop in for happy hour and order a cheese crisp and eat it with refried beans and tons of salsa.

Pollo Supremo leaves you with a wholesome feeling after you eat there.  It is money well spent!  I am vegetarian and usually get rice, beans, tortillas, pickled onion and salsa and it comes out to $4.  My husband gets the quarter chicken and eats it at least twice a week.  Their menu is simple, dishes are delicious and prices are affordable.  You cannot go wrong with Pollo Supremo!

This pizza is the BEST.  The crust is light and somehow crisp and soft at the same time.  The sauce is heavenly.  I do not have tons of disposable income but Ottos is worth the $10 extra dollars over the big chain pizza joints.  I love adding feta to pizza so I get the Greek pizza and substitute tomatoes for black olives.  Greek pizza roll is also good-- just has a higher bread to toppings ratio.  Get extra marinara on the side and you will be set.  I would give Ottos 10 stars if I could.

Haji Baba never disappoints.  Must haves include tabouli, hummus, greek salad, rice and pistachio baklava.  It is completely affordable and next to a small market which is also affordable.  When I have money I can't leave without buying some dates, spices, pita and fresh bulgarian feta.  Everything is good here!

I went with a few coworkers for happy hour (3- 6pm) and will definitely be back.  I got the grapefruit IPA ($5) and the margarita pizza ($6) with marinara dipping sauce.  The sundried tomatoes and roasted garlic on the pizza were phenomenal!  We sat at the bar and the bar tenders were very nice to chat with.  Shout out to Zach!

If you go in for lunch (11-3) you can get the Indian buffet which is really good.  Dosas are brought fresh to your table and the selection of curries is extensive.  They change it up and it's always something new-- sometimes they even have somosas with the buffet.    (Note: In the summer they are closed from 4-5).  When we go in for dinner I always order the Udupi special with soup, idly, masala dosa and chai.  Delicious!!  If I'm hungry enough to order an appetizer it's samosa chaat all the way.

Everyone I know (who is under the age of 50) LOVES Cornish Pasty Co.  It is great for meat eaters, vegetarians, beer drinkers and winos.  They have kept the menu simple and everything they make is prepared fresh-- right in front of you.   My recommendations- start with a large salad-- it is huge and the lemon dressing is terrific.  To drink it's fun to get a snakebite-- Cider+Guinness.  Go for the vegetarian "chicken" tikka masala pasty with yogurt dipping sauce all the way!!  Keep in mind, it is just about the most hipster place you can imagine, so you can't expect bubbly customer service, but go for the food- it is worth it!

To this day best falafel I have ever had.  Crisp on the outside and flavorful throughout.  I need to go back just for the falafel.

I was getting my car fixed at The Car Shop across the street and walked over for lunch.  The sign above the building calls the place Taqueros and it was not until I walked up that I saw it was called Sombrero's Mexican Grill.  The place is colorful and clean and the women that work there (the owners?) are really nice.  Originally I was struck by the way they seemed to rip off Chipotle's business model and Somburros name but the lack of originality does not even matter.  They run a clean operation!   My husband loves chipotle and I hate it (because my burrito always ends up being ice cold) preferring the greasier -burtos joints.  Sombrero's is our happy median.  I can get a wheat tortilla, pinto beans that are actually vegetarian (unlike Chipotle's pork laden beans), deliciously spicy green sauce and free chips.  It is a really good value and if you frequent chipotle I would encourage you to make the switch to Sombrero's and support local business!

Ethipoian food is my favorite cuisine and perfect for vegetarians out there.  This particular Ethiopian resturant has the best injera compared to other Ethiopian restaurants in Phoenix-really flavorful!  The owner told me it's because they use 100% teff flour and other places cut their injera with wheat flour.  I used to go here exclusively for to-go food because the ambience of the place was dreary.  Recently, however; they reinvested some money into sprucing the place up and now I don't mind dining in.  They added a bar and improved the lightening and it is more inviting now.  I would recommend getting the veggie combo and letting the chef choose your sides.  They will give you what's fresh and available that day.

This is one of the best Ethiopian food resturant in Phoenix and I have eaten at all of them.  If  you don't mind cramped dives then you are sure to love it as well.  I wish I could eat the vegetarian combination platter every other day.  At $12 for two people- it is in the realm of possibilities.  Finish your meal off with a spicy pepper stuffed with pico de gallo.  Delicious.

I am in shock-  16 oz juices for $10 is a complete rip off.

Fresh, welcoming and authentic.  My new favorite!  I appreciate a salsa bar and theirs is complete with fresh veggies- tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro and pico de gallo.  The owner is really nice and I will definitely be back to support this small business!  You are in for a treat.
