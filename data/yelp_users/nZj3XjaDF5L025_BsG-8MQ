So this may not be the most helpful review but I was turned off from the moment I called the store to see if they had a certain product.   A little history: my poor fish, Effie, is suffering from the big C: Constipation! That's right! My poor little blocked up Effie can't make things happen and she's floating around like a fish whose had one too many fish cocktails, wobbling back and forth because she's too heavy to control her direction! It's seriously sad watching her struggle and it seems I've exhausted all of my Google-searched methods until I came across a product called Daphnia.   Apparently it's some type of dried up worm or something that helps... alleviate some of the blockage! Since this was my last resort and I only had time during my lunch break to get this, I'd thought I should call Petsmart to ensure they actually have it!   When I asked the employee on the phone if she had the product, she immediately replied with a cold "no." No "let me check to see," or "I'm not sure, let me find out," but just "no." So I was left with an awkward silence and disappointment as I quietly said "...oh. Ok. Well, thanks?" Something just didn't sit well with me after that.   Anyway, I decided to go with a more local pet shop, which was right down the street. The guy working there was SO friendly and helpful, and as I told him the story about Petsmart, he replied "I'm pretty sure they do have this same exact product over there."   Needless to say, I won't bother going in that Petsmart from the phone call alone. Are the employees that lazy that they can't even check to see if there's a product? Must not want my service!

I love Sakana! The sushi is good, but the thing that really keeps me coming back is the consistency! The staff is always friendly, welcoming, and quick. The food is always good, never once had a bad experience! And the atmosphere is busy and lively, but never too loud where you can't hear the other people you came with and enjoy a good conversation.

I really love this place. I came here because it's conveniently close to my house and I was not dissatisfied.   Staff - super friendly; greet you as soon as you walk in.  Services - I only got the pedicure, but it was a great experience. They spend so much time massaging your legs, I feel like I'm at a massage parlor! Its the best part!  Price - very reasonable! $25 before tip which I thought was good. I added the sea salt scrub to my pedi and it still only came to $25 which leads me to believe that it's cheaper without.   Overall, really great service for a great price! I will definitely be going back! :)

Yikes! Would you like a nice long hair embedded in your Seared Ahi Tuna Hummus plate?! We didn't either but that's what we got! The pita bread served with it was cold and stale! Yuck!   I must say the waiter was the reason my review got revived to two stars instead of one. He was very friendly, apologetic, and prompt to fix the errors. He didn't charge us for the hairy entree, whew! Thank goodness!  My partner ordered from there today at work and let me know that the pita bread was growing mold this time!   The dine-in experience is awfully tempting because of the beautiful lake view but the quality of their food is questionable, to say the least. I think I'll just opt for a homemade picnic by the lake instead of taking my chances again here!   Sorry!

I'm kind of surprised that this place only has a 3.5 star rating overall. It's such a great little discount store!  I started coming here this year, since I am fairly new to the Chandler area, but each of my experiences have been positive. They have loads of Christmas decorations in time for the season, which is great, because, who doesn't love Christmas decorations for a dollar?! I also enjoy coming here to pick up little items, like tape or wrapping paper for gifts. I don't ever buy food from here so I can't say anything about that...but on behalf of the other products, I give it a thumbs up because they really do offer a lot for such a cheap price.

Terrible food. Were the steak tacos supposed to be purely made of steak fat? To top it off, got charged for a beer that I took two sips of and sent back. Will not be going back.

Two stars because no matter how hard I try, this mall just irritates the living daylights out of me!   Ok, yes, it's an outlet mall so I suppose that in itself will bring a crowd. (Who doesn't like a good discount??). But I mean, wow. If you're any sort of claustrophobic, I would think twice about shopping here.   It seems as though I've either got that really slow family walking in front of me, with the one kid lagging behind, looking at everyone and every thing that passes by. The mom, pushing a stroller with like 3 other whiny kids inside, is too preoccupied to notice the young wanderer because she's texting her bff pictures of what she just bought. Who knows! But every time I try to pass, the whole family seems to unconsciously veer in my direction, blocking me from getting around. Or there's the complete opposite... The people who are in such a damn hurry but they end up right behind you and just keep barely missing the back of your heel with each step. I swear those people will stay behind you for a good 5 minutes before they finally get the hint that, yes, that really IS my pace!   Anyway, the stores are okay because the prices are decent. It's just a jungle that you really have to fight your way through to get there, so, really, the question is: how far are you willing to go for a sale?

As far as movie theaters, this really IS as good as it gets!  There's a yelper below me that says "don't come here - I want it all to myself" and I must agree! Once you come to this theater, you'll never want to go to an AMC or Harkins again. The seats recline and they are incredibly roomy, so you can sprawl out like as if you were on your own couch! (But please remember folks, we are in public; so maybe not quite like you are in your own home!) The theater size is small and cozy, limiting the noise that can sometimes, unfortunately, inhibit popular showings. The best thing that I like is that you can reserve your seats. It really helps when you know the movie is going to be crowded, but you've got a seat locked in.   The staff are also super friendly and the prices are pretty average, in comparison to other movie theaters.   I highly recommend this theater... unless you are an obnoxious movie-goer that talks during showings; you can go to AMC.

Never in my wildest dreams would I imagine giving a Walmart 5 stars on a Yelp review, but here goes;  So, I'm a little weird when it comes to Walmarts. I don't like the over-crowded, overly-noisy, over-scary stores and, well let's face it, Walmart seems to constantly win the award on that one. But this one, this one, folks, is seriously a winner. I go here probably once a week for household goods, and I've never once felt... intimidated... by this store. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The lines aren't long and slow;  can I get a hallelujah?! And there's always a cute little elderly greeter/bag checker by the door, who makes some silly little comment whilst checking your items against the receipt!   Finally, a normal Walmart I can add to the books!

If anyone knows me, they know my love for coffee.   As a former Starbucks employee, I recommend this location. The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable. The line is really never that long and it always moves quickly. Drinks are always made perfectly, each and every time.   Left off one star because this location doesn't offer a drive-thru, which bugs me a little bit! Needless to say, it's not their fault... just a pet peeve of mine; actually having to get out of the car and face the world! ;)  All in all, it's a great stop for your morning cup-a joe!

I really love this place.   A little history; I have two cats, Shelly and Mo-mo. Mo-mo is definitely the more "chill" one in the household (requiring little to no maintenance), but my poor Shelly is anxious about almost everything, it seems! Poor thing stressed out so much that she developed a urinary tract infection. We moved to the area about a year ago and really hadn't researched any animal clinics until her emergency UTI, unfortunately.   When I did a Google search for veterinary clinics, in the midst of my worrying, AZ Ave Animal Clinic was one of the first to pop up and I'm so happy that it did! Upon calling to schedule an urgent apt, the receptionist was very friendly and I could hear the care and concern in her voice when I told her about Shelly. She was able to squeeze me in with Dr. Sarah, who is such a wonderful vet!   She was patient, knowledgeable, and caring towards Shelly. (Even if Shelly did growl at her quite a bit in fear!). Dr. Sarah took the time to really listen to what was wrong, what her symptoms were, abnormal behaviors, etc. It was such a relief to have someone like that taking care of our (admittedly high maintenance) cat.   What really gave this place a 5th star was the fact that Dr. Sarah told me to call her with any problems or questions in the next couple of days. She went beyond the standard call and care and extended her kindness beyond the initial visit. I highly recommend her!   Thanks to this place, Shelly is 100% back to normal. They knew exactly what to do and I felt very included and important in all of the decisions, not like just another customer.

This was my first time coming to Harold's, as I live significantly far from here, but overall, it was a positive experience!  My fianc√©e and I came for a birthday celebration and really didn't know what to expect in terms of food, attire, etc. (It's actually unusual we didn't Yelp it!). We were pleasantly surprised to stroll in to a nice, laid back, country-style restaurant that had a very fun feel to it!   We were able to reserve a few tables that the staff kindly put together, however, it was quite difficult to hear someone right next to you when the live band was playing. It got very loud, so don't expect to have a very intimate setting! ;)   I'm not a fair judge of the food since I only ordered the potato skins, but those were actually pretty yummy! I will mention that service was a TAD slow in the beginning.. The potato skins took quite some time to come out, but it's really not worth complaining over. Our server was extremely friendly and helpful, which made up for it.   I don't think I'll be back to try other dishes because of 1) the distance from my house and 2) it's mainly just bar food from what I could see and I'm not the biggest fan! All in all, the experience was good. I got to bust out some country dancing moves, which I had no idea what I was doing, but the dance floor is just so welcoming that I had to give it a shot!

Had to go here yesterday to the Helzburg Diamonds store inside to get my fianc√©e's ring cleaned. (Love the service in that store!) I strongly prefer this mall to the Arizona Mills one on Baseline and the i10. A yelper below me described this mall as "classy" and I have to agree!  The mall is clean and not overly-crowded (one of my biggest pet peeves). Encounters with the staff of each store I go to have always been positive. Considering they work in retail AND in a mall, I give them a lot of kudos right off the bat! It must be a tough job. But they are all very friendly, striking up small talk and asking if I need any help finding things.   I actually stopped by at one of the Auntie Anne's (I believe there is two), and a young lady behind the counter just chatted with me about her recent trip to Disney. Sometimes you just want to hug people for not being so scared to have a friendly conversation and for actually being nice without completely forcing it! It's a nice relief when an employee shows you they appreciate your business and not try to rush you away after the sale.   Overall, a really good mall to go to if you're from the area. Parking can be a pain sometimes but I would imagine that's with all malls.

I went here on a quiet Saturday evening last week with my mom and fiancee, and I must, first off, commend the restaurant on their cleanliness, hospitality, and warmth.   As soon as you walk in, there is a glass case filled with pastries galore that kindly invite you to dine-in, in hopes that you may feel so inclined to delight yourself in such a tasty decadence. The menu is colorfully and largely posted above the welcoming cashier, patiently waiting to take your order.   I decided on the mixed grill hot sandwich and a bowl of the vegan vegetable soup. We all ordered a sandwich and I truly appreciate the service from the order-taker. (Lord knows my family can be quite the particular orderers!)   Onto the food! I can't speak for either my mom or fiancee but I will say I was slightly disappointed with my mixed grill sandwich. (To enlighten, I don't eat any dairy, so my sandwich was quite modified, to say the least!) I really only had the meat, onions, pickle, and bread. And while the flavors were still there (and exceptionally yummy!), the quantity left me frowny-faced. Nobody likes more bread than meat on a sandwich, am I right! I caught myself tearing pieces of excess bread a few times to get the perfect meat to bread ratio in each bite. No complaints against the yummy soup!  Overall, the experience was great and I will most likely be back, however, I will probably be picking something a little more hearty from the menu!

I am truly touched by the customer service of Wildflower. Overwhelmed by the letter I received in the mail today from the founder, Louis Basile Jr.  Enclosed was a $10 check, to refund me for my sandwich (see review above), and a $12 gift card, for when I return again! This type of customer support deserves an award! Big thanks to Louis for reaching out to me! I always thought that Wildflower was a great restaurant, but this is just over the top! Wildflower truly takes care of their customers!

I'm finding it hard to understand why the overall rating of this place is so terrible! I really enjoyed the store and the employees.   I have not tried to donate clothes here, so I can't comment on that portion. Although, judging by the reviews, they do seem quite choosy on what they take.   As far as shopping goes, I love the selection that they provide. They stay up to date on the current styles and trends, and the prices are so affordable! I found multiple shirts that I really liked for $2.50! I also bought a pair of black jean shorts for $6.00. I will definitely be going back for clothes.   As far as service, the girls behind the counter are really friendly, in my opinion! If I could suggest one thing though, I would ask that they either open more than just one register, or at least try to speed up their checkout process. Seems like only girl works a register and so I ended up standing in line for about 10 minutes with only one person ahead of me. It gets a little annoying when you're ready to leave.   Other than that, I will definitely go back to check out what they acquire in the near future!

Of course, food is always affordable and fresh at all Sprouts locations, however, if you're wanting good customer service and guaranteed stocked shelves, I suggest bypassing this one and going for the one on 48th St and Ray.   One of the young female associates working there nearly snapped at me for asking if they carried Kelp noodles. "What!?" she screeched rudely, instead of "I'm sorry, I didn't understand what you said." "Kelp noodles," I replied patiently. She pointed down the aisle we were in, annoyed, saying "I really don't know but here is our selection of noodles. If we have them, they'd be here." "Thanks for all your help," I said sarcastically, feeling frustrated and disappointed to get that kind of treatment from someone who is supposed to helping their customers. "You're welcome!" she proudly said, with a grin on her face. Three words; terrible customer service. Wish she would have at least asked another associate if they carried them.   Besides the kelp noodles, I could not find a few more of my products that I needed. The basil leaves were all out, until I hunted another associate down who found some in the back. Their clear plastic baggies to put various items in were all out except for one or two stations, which makes for an awkward situation when you're carrying a handful of fruits in your hand, looking for something to put them in.   All in all, I wouldn't recommend this Sprouts. The employees are disgruntled and the items are in desperate need of restocking.

Cute little local wrap and sandwich shop. Service and food are pretty good!   The cashiers were very friendly and accommodating. I don't get cheese or mayo on my sandwiches and they were understanding of that. I got the Club sandwich and it was pretty yummy. The bacon was a bit fatty but I suppose that's really what bacon is! Although I didn't care for the chewy bits of fat that I got occasionally.   The food was brought out to us relatively fast. One thing I might add is that apparently there was a special that day with the club sandwich and they didn't bother to ask if I wanted it as a special. Disappointing because the special comes with chips and a drink and is cheaper than ordering all items separately.   Seating is a bit of a challenge when you are there on a weekday lunch rush. Not sure if it's the same on weekends. The tables are small and they don't move! So there are no pushing tables together for more than 2 people. I believe I did see one big table that seats maybe 6-8 people, but it was already taken.   All in all, it's a cute place with pretty good food. If I'm ever in the area again, I will probably stop by!

I really love Whole Foods, especially when it comes to quality of food. The fruit is always fresh and delicious and the meat is excellent - even the ground beef smells like a plump juicy burger while saut√©ing on the stove. The employees are also very friendly and super helpful.   Gave it 4 stars because of the cost. I know its worth the price because of the great quality, however, it can be expensive to do weekly shopping trips there. Have to alternate between Sprouts and Fresh & Easy.

An update to my review. Still 4 stars because my experience was neither better or worse than before, however, I would like to note something about the freshly made sandwiches.   There's that part of the store where you can order from the buffet, pizza area, Asian food, or sandwiches. I've grown pretty fond of the sandwich place and my favorite dish is the Vegan Chicken Slaw on sourdough, instead of the wrap. The chicken is a bit... weird, for lack of better words, IF you are not used to vegan chicken. Otherwise, it's still pretty tasty! And the sauces are a perfectly spicy, creamy, and savory blend that coats the slaw and bread. Top it off with a delicious avocado and you're good to go! It's super filling too!   Gotta say I was a little disappointed in the service though. I was first acknowledged by a girl behind the counter who was working on a wrap. She let me stand there awkwardly for about a minute or two before saying "be right with you." As she was preparing the wrap, a guy walked into the station, looked at me, but then started talking to the girl about his and her break. Hmm, ok. Still awkwardly standing there. Then he tells her to go on break. She looks up at me and somewhat mouths "be right with you" again. And then proceeds to go on break. So, I'd say about 5 minutes has passed, the wrap that she was working on is on the counter now, and I'm clearly ignoring that (since it's not mine), still waiting to be helped. The guy that was walking back and forth is now talking on a phone that's hanging on the wall and then he hangs up, and gives me the "one minute" finger as he walks away.   By this point, I'm trying not to get upset because I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. It wasn't until someone in the pizza area saw me and yelled over "have you been helped yet?" When I said no, the guy that gave me the "hold on" gesture walks over and says "is there something else I can help you with?" And as I tell him that the wrap still sitting there is not mine, he apologizes and takes my order. No biggie but this all could have been avoided if someone would have just communicated that I hadn't been helped!

I used to live on this side of town and would stop in this Starbucks because it was conveniently located near my house. The staff were always very friendly and personable, but I must agree with the other Yelpers when they comment on the slowness of the store. They are terribly slow for some reason, inside and drive-thru. I wouldn't recommend stopping at this one before work, or anywhere you need to be on time for that matter. It's more a "weekend, I-have-nothing-better-to-do" kind of Starbucks, with no sense of real urgency.

I've been here about 2 or 3 times and each experience has been pleasant.   The drink concoctions are delicious! I have tried the Kale-aid and the Apple Carrot Ginger tonic. Both were very crisp and refreshing. I felt "healthily renewed" after the first sip!  Their fresh ingredients are what will keep me coming back. Service is good too! No complaints.

The main reason for the perfect star review is not only great tasting pizza, but their commendable consistency in taste, customer service, and time.   Imagine this: A lactose-intolerant foodie craving some good hearty pizza on a Friday night. Sounds crazy doesn't it? But it DOES happen folks! I'm here to tell you that I am living proof of the scenario described above. But what's a gal to do when she can't eat that ooey-gooey-melt-in-your-mouth-what-makes-a-good-pizza CHEESE!? I'll tell ya what; she goes to Clockwork!   Let me tell you this IRL story. So I get off work, it's 5pm on a Friday and like I said, my stomach's growling "pizza, pizza, pizza!" I ring up my good old buddies at clockwork, (such good buddies that I have them saved in my contacts... Yea, that's right), and I say "hey dudes, I need a godfather pizza, XL, and hold the cheese!" And you know what the cool part is? They don't even question it! They're just like alright, cool. And that's that! Other pizza places just give you an awkwardly judgmental silence on the phone and say "wait, no cheese??" So discriminatory!   Anyway - 30 minutes later, I've got my amazing cheese-less pizza with such powerful flavors, you would seriously think cheese was on this. So if I know that a pizza from here without cheese is possibly the best pizza I've ever had, well, think of the possibilities YOU have WITH cheese! For all you pizza lovers out there, cheese tolerant or not! Order from here! I'm telling you, you won't be disappointed.

I heart Wholly Grill!   Try the BBQ pork skewers with rice and you won't be disappointed! The pork is flavored perfectly and the portions are super filling. It's the only dish I've tried and it's hard to break away from it because it's so delicious!   The only sad thing is that they are only open for a short time on Sundays. To me, it's more of a dinner time option so it would be nice to have it after 5 but at least they're open conveniently throughout the week and on Saturday.   They are located in an Asian marketplace called Mekong Plaza and there are lots of little neat shops to go in after grubbing. Be prepared for busyness on the weekends but it's so worth it!

I really loved the food here. Salmon was fresh and delicious. The Phoenix roll was good too. I wouldn't recommend it though if you don't like sweet tasting entrees. Also, if you're mostly wanting sushi rolls, I probably wouldn't recommend this place as there is only 5 rolls to choose from on their menu. If you're looking for fresh fish entrees, give this place a try! A bit pricey, but definitely worth the cost.

The only thing I'll ever go back here for is the beer! You can mix and match from their beer selection for a customized 6-pack. I can't remember how much it is but I believe it is under $10.   The food/dining experiences are ALWAYS unpleasant. I've been to this restaurant to eat maybe 4-5 times and each time is absolutely terrible. I've stopped going ever since they screwed up my order the last time. It's like the servers don't speak English or something. You can tell them day in and day out, "I can't eat dairy, mayo, or butter" and they still shlop mayo and butter all over your dish. I remember ordering a pulled pork and they smeared mayo all over the bun. I mean, who even wants mayo on their pulled pork?? That's just disgusting, I'm sorry. Anyway, after countless times of trying to tell them how I want my food, trying to notify managers, even emailing the customer service email on their website (and got no response), I gave up! It really is a shame because I think they have the potential to put out some really good food!

Haven't been here in a while but I always enjoy it when I go. Great flavors, big portions! Can't understand why people are so upset about the pricing. Some people just don't get that you are paying for the quality of the meat. If you want a $1 burger injected with hormones and GMO's, go to McDonalds.

Really great and friendly staff that greets you when you walk in, a variety of yogurt flavors (more than any other froyo place I've been), and excellent toppings; what more could you want! It is a little bit far from my place, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. I have only been here 3 times or so but each time never disappoints. I definitely recommend it!

Thankfully I moved away from this area and have built a nice home gym for myself. No more gym nightmares for this gal!   Anyway, this gym is fine if you like overcrowded, dirty, unorganized gyms! There are always so many people, even when they first open at 5am, good luck getting the equipment you want. Also, the free weights are always scattered ALL over the gym! What's up with that? Don't the staff ever get up from their desks and take a walk around the gym to put things away? It's kind of ironic that the staff at a gym are lazy.. And don't forget about the dirtiness too. There was one time, I was working out in the free weight area, and this really obnoxious dude (who walks around like he owns the gym but still has a huge gut) spit on the floor! I kid you not. He hawked and spit on the gym floor, right next to me. I wanted to punch him in his face.   Good luck if you sign up with this gym. I was nothing but disappointed with it. But then again, it's Laveen. Pretty much everything in this area is disappointing.

Nami is awesome. Recommended for Vegans (of course) but for non-vegans as well. The Country Breakfast Burrito is so good and filling! Top it off with a Dough Boy tsoynami and your day is off to an incredible start ;)

Always a line out the door for Nami. The food is incredible! Try the vegan Huevos Rancheros burrito. So filling and fantastically yummy!   Knocked one star off because of the unfriendly girl @ the counter. She barely smiled and looked highly annoyed. The rest of the staff is extremely pleasant!   Still love the food though and will keep coming back!

Love the food at this Pita Jungle. It's consistently good, every time!   It's strange how different locations vary in terms of quality.. I really don't care for the Pita Jungle closest to my house, for various reasons, but this one I will keep coming back for.   My favorite dish is the Lentil Fatoosh salad and it is very delicious! It's quite a hearty salad, piled high with lentils, rice, cucumbers, tomatoes, and caramelized onions (my fave!), and did I mention the fried pita bread on the side!? (It's really the best part of the salad, IMO!) It's the type of salad that leaves you full, but wanting more bites of it! Not many salads have that effect on me! ;)   Service is always really great too! I don't think I've ever had one bad experience here.

I am surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet, as many times as I come here! This is a long overdue review!   Hands down, this place is amazing! The ambiance of the restaurant, with its cool Mediterranean music and vibes, pulls you in to sit down and stay awhile! The smell of sizzling gyro meat, filling the air and luring you in for a taste! The crispy hot french fries, pairing so perfectly with their (seemingly) endless ketchup supply, is enough to keep you hooked for good! Okay, so now that I sound like the Mika's addict that I am, let me convince you just how awesome they are!    Their customer service, nothing short of perfect! Consistently sweet, consistently welcoming, consistently great service. These guys are super fast too! I usually call ahead to come pick up my order, and within 5-10 minutes, it's there waiting for me! I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for my order.   The food is downright delicious. HUGE portions, served fresh and hot! I tend to shy away from dairy, (as it sadly doesn't agree much with my tummy!), but their Tatziki sauce is something I can actually eat, and brag about! It's a MUST try! It's just so yummy and flavorful! It really brings the classic gyro together, in my opinion!  Another plus, for all you soda lovers out there, a fancy Coke machine that lets you pick and choose different flavors for your plain ol' soda, making it a customizable delight!

I really like these outlets. The location is great; only about 15 minutes from my house. There is a variety of stores to shop in. And, the sales and prices really are worth it! Sometimes you find yourself in an "outlet" mall, not really finding any deals. This is not the case here, folks. Each time I visit here, I'm always able to find a bargain.   One store in particular, I must mention. First, a little history:   My fianc√©e has been wanting a Michael Kors bag for a while now. She's not only hinted at it, but it's embedded in her Amazon search history as well. (In case you didn't know, when it reaches the Amazon search history, it's pretty serious at this point 0_0). It's really not like her to buy expensive, name-brand purses, but she was tired of buying cheap ones that lasted only a few weeks before it wearing out. Her eyes were set on "Selma," (to clarify, Selma is a purse... Luckily for me, right?).   Anywho, we got to the store and were immediately greeted by Alexis. She not only helped us find "Selma," but she also notably discounted the price by mentioning that they price match to whatever we find online! Without this key note, we would have easily paid $100 more for full price. And being as though my fianc√©e rarely buys such things, I'd imagine the full price would deter her from actually following through with the transaction.   So, a big thanks to Alexis for the tip! Keep selling those purses, girl!

This Starbucks just opened up and I am so thrilled that it's a drive thru! Not to mention, the employees here are much friendlier than the ones down the road!   I ordered a grande iced coffee and a cake pop - because, well seriously, have you TRIED the cake pops?! I will say though that I was very excited about the cookie dough one, which is fairly new, and upon trying it, it was actually not that great. It had sort of a butterscotch taste to it and I'm really not a fan of that! I'd stick with the birthday cake ones. Can't go wrong with those!   The service is really great! The girl at the window was friendly and engaging, as she struck up a conversation with me while waiting for my items. I think this may be my new go-to Starbucks, folks!

This has got to be the best Starbucks I go to, hands down.   I pass this location on my morning commute to work. I have to be at work by 8 am and there have been times where I will pull into the drive-thru, with cars stretched out to the street (close to 10 or more cars), at 7:50 (I know, risk-taker!), and I will still get my coffee and be at work with time to spare! Grant it, my work is only about 5 miles from this Starbucks, but the speed of their service is commendable, every single time.   On top of that, they are extremely friendly and accommodating. One morning, they accidentally overcharged my card for the wrong order. When I told them it was wrong, they refunded the amount and comped my actual drink order, so I got a cup of free coffee that day. The whole misunderstanding took all of 2 minutes to correct. No arguing. No confusion. Just great customer service.   The employees here are definitely on their A-game every day. They are hella quick, precise, and consistent. I highly recommend this location, especially if you like your service FAST.   One thing I might mention is that the parking lot is a tad small and it can be a pain to park when the lot is highly busy. I rarely go inside the store though so it's not a huge problem for me.

I officially "tied the knot" in this courthouse and I really have no complaints.   The judge was extremely welcoming and friendly, and made the "ceremony" quite touching. His little speech brought me and my other half to tears that we honestly didn't expect! (We plan to have to have the actual wedding ceremony later in the year and figured this was just a "strictly business" procedure and truly expected a very cold, document signing process). But to our pleasant surprise, it was actually a beautifully memorable experience. If you are looking to get married through this courthouse, opt for Judge John McComish. He really made our day special.   The whole procedure took around 30 minutes, and that's including waiting for another couple to wed! All in all, it was a great experience. Will most likely go back for my future marriages. ;)

This is an all vegan restaurant, which is very appealing to me since I associate myself, more and more lately, as vegan. Plus I don't eat any dairy products so it's nice to have good, tasty, and fulfilling meals that I know won't upset my tummy!   Just a heads up, this place is a little pricey! For an entree and dessert for one, I got a total of around $17! But they really do make delicious food that doesn't taste "averagely vegan" in the least, so I say it's worth it every once and a while!   Tonight, I had the Southwest Wrap and a lavender cookie sandwich with strawberry filling. The wrap was a little powerful in its cilantro dressing, which kind of overpowered the dish, unfortunately. Toward the end, I just started scraping off the excess filling and just enjoyed the flavor of the homemade, toasty wrap! The dessert took the cake (pun intended?!) for me! The lavender cookie was much like a scone, with biscuity characteristics, and the strawberry filling was sweetly welcomed. The two together paired very nicely.  All in all, of course I will be back! They do have the best vegan dishes on this side of town, by far. They also offer raw too, which is rare and very appreciated. Try the Raw Tacos! You won't be disappointed!

No complaints against this salon!   I have been on the lookout for a new salon for a while, and I can now confidently say that my hair has found a new [organic] home! A few things to like about this place:  -The products are organic; which is a nice alternative from the regular salons, because you can feel the difference!  -The customer service is top-notch! Even had the owner of the salon check in on my coloring session a few times, to make sure everything was going right.  -Service is quick, and the staff are upfront with the consultation. I got my hair done with Shawna, and before doing anything, she addressed everything she'd be doing, what it would cost me, and what she recommends. What's even better is that she never trailed off from what she told me from the start. You can expect honesty and good quality from start to finish.  The price is a little high. Cost me $140 for dye and a deep conditioner, but I suppose that's the reality when you are getting good service and good products. Can't cut corners when it comes to quality - especially for my hair!

I've only been to this location once, so maybe my review is not the most accurate but I will briefly mention how I felt when I did go..   I think Michele K's review below really hits the nail on the head. I drink plain black coffee so, really, it's kind of hard to screw that up. The coffee was okay, but the service is what made me say "meh." The employees don't really seem to want anyone there. I don't even think I was greeted when I walked in, and I remember standing there with my fianc√©e for a while before someone reluctantly came to the counter.   For me, it's very difficult to hand over my money to someone who is less than thrilled to take my order. Honestly, I would much rather go to the Starbucks on Alma School and Elliot and know that the service will be good, along with the coffee.

I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I called and scheduled an appointment ahead of time and the receptionist let me know that for a first time visit, the 60 min massage is $28. I thought, this has got to be too good to be true. I followed through with the appointment but wasn't really expecting anything amazing.   They set me up in a room with about 10 other massage beds. They told me to take off my glasses, shoes, jewelry, etc., and place it in a small basket. Clothes stayed on. Not really the typical massage setting!   The man who massaged me was very kind but did not say much. I noticed there was a bit of a language barrier because after the massage, he asked if I exercised every day and when I said "yea, kind of," he just kind of nervously laughed. I could tell he didn't quite understand. I have to deduct one star for that because there were times where he would leave the room and I wasn't sure if the massage was done! I was laying there waiting for him to come back. Grant it, it was only about 30 sec when he did leave (to go grab towels and whatnot), but since there was that language barrier, he never said where he was going.   Other than that, the massage was absolutely amazing! At first, I didn't think it would be a full body. I thought maybe just the feet and arms, since I was fully dressed, but he covered everything! It was mostly pressure points, stretching, pushing, etc. Again, not your typical massage, but I felt so relaxed afterwards! I will definitely be going back for future massages!

Yum, yum, these cakes are DEE-lish-OUS! :)   Although I've personally never ordered a cake myself, (just delighted in a few of them here and there for birthday parties and whatnot), I would still like to share my experience. The cakes are super moist and not too rich! Many-a time, I would sit there, after a big couple of bites, contemplate my fullness, and regretfully stuff another piece into my mouth. You just can't help it! These cakes leave you coming back for more, even when your belly can't bear another bite!

Woo-hoo, the first to review! :)   It's a great gym. It's clean, tons of cardio equipment, lots of weight machines, and a really nice stretch area. Not to mention, there are massage chairs, hydro-massage tables, and tanning beds. If you sign up for the $20 membership as opposed to the $10, the massages and tanning come packaged in the deal.   If you're a big fitness buff, and have the "need to feed" your bulging muscles, I would consider a different gym. Planet Fitness is all about beginners to moderate gym goers, just looking to stay healthy and generally fit. The free weight area is relatively small, as compared to other gyms I've gone to, and there are circuit areas that help people by literally alerting you to move to the next station, after a minute or so. It's like interval training. I've never personally tried it but it looks really nice and I would imagine its helpful for people who struggle with constructing workout plans.   I'm mainly a cardio gal myself, so I mostly just hop on the treadmill, and add an occasional weight machine here and there. Therefore, the gym is really not a necessity for me unless it's blistering cold outside and I can't run out there! I will say though that their stretching area is something to brag about. I don't routinely stretch... I know, bad! But if you happen to stumble into this [quite large] room, 100% devoted to stretching, guaranteed, you're going to want to at least do some quad stretches or something!
