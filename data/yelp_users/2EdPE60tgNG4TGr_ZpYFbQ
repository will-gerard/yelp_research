We were looking for a good breakfast place away from the strip and found Mr. Mama's due to the positive reviews. It was about 3 miles off the strip which felt like an eternity in the car.  We walked in and there was a 20 minute wait but the hostess was so pleasant that I didn't even mind. After I sat down to wait, she offered us homemade fudge samples. UM YES PLEASE! I happily ate my fudge and perused the menu...prices were extremely affordable and the food looked great from what I saw leaving the kitchen. This place was really different I noticed old black and white photos on the wall of a restaurant which I assumed was an old location of Mr. Mama's there was also a large Greece poster on the far wall, the walls were blue and they had a gyro special.  I thought that's kind of strange for a breakfast joint but the owners must be Greek.   We were seated and our service was prompt and good. Food was excellent! After eating I got up and was waiting for the rest of my party and was telling the hostess how great everything was and she thanked us for coming in.. That's when I had my chance to ask about the old photos hanging on the wall. Turns out her father is the owner and the original location was in Michigan and she pointed out pics of her grandfather and her great grand father.  WOW! I love hearing a restaurants history.  She told me they are in fact Greek which explains the blue wall, the gyros and the poster.  Everyone that worked there was so nice and thanked us all for coming in.  Great experience. If I lived in Vegas I would be a regular.

Every time that I am in Arizona I make it a point to come to Yogalution. Rebecca, the owner of the studio is a very thorough and hands on instructor. This studio is a donation based studio with a suggested donation of $10, which I love! Any other yoga studios drop in rate is at least $15. Yogalution is truly a hidden gem in Scottsdale.  She is opening a location in downtown Phoenix soon as well!  Check out a class, you will not be disappointed.

I came here for a early Mother's Day dinner with my family because of:  A) The ratings and B) We were craving delicious, wood-fired pizza...Here's why I was let down and I think POMO could improve upon:   -The server wasn't enthusiastic, he seemed bored and disinterested.    -The pizza literally took FOREVER...probably 1 hour and without any communication from the server to let us know it was coming, or when we could expect it to arrive.  Luckily we did have a few appetizers to tide us over (Bread is $2 FYI and they don't carry pesto?)  - What we ordered: Kale salad (waste of money and not good) , Bruschetta (actually tasty), wood-fired pizza (soggy crust, did not impress me at all..didn't even taste wood-fired) Spaghetti Bolognese (My Dad sent it back, it tasted like hamburger helper)   The food quality is very mediocre for the price you pay.  Go to Grimaldi's or Oreganos and save your money.

I have been wanting to try a Kaleidoscope juice for a while now, but I live in San Diego and I don't think SoCal is within delivery boundaries!    I was laid up in bed sick as a dog when I was scrolling through my Instagram feed and saw Antonyoga11 posted a sweet pic about a new juice bar location. I was so stoked and thought to myself "this is just what I need to get better!" The next day as I was feeling better I met a friend to grab a juice and check the place out. FYI: They have another location 2 blocks away where they make the cold pressed juice and they have a runner that shuttles over Flavors they don't have in the cooler, so make sure you don't make this mistake. Even if you do it's walking distance so no big.   After we found it we oohed and aahed at the awesome building and colors. I especially love the logo design. The two people behind the counter were really helpful. They explained the cold press process and what other bevys and snacks you could get there. I opted for Anton's spinach and it was deeeeelicious! Highly recommend this. Also, on the table inside they had a cute baking sheet of some goodies cut up for sampling. There is a small bar and a larger communal table for seating. Outside they had a cute patio with chairs, not to mention a walk up window which is awesome!  This place is going to kill it in Scottsdale! Next I want to try the cleanses.

I love trying new coffee shops when I'm visiting Phoenix, so checked out Yelp's latest and greatest. I honestly chose "Be" because (no pun intended) for the cute decor and furnishings.   When I got in the green logo on the cups looked familiar . I didn't know where I had seen it until I sat down and overheard who I think was one of the owners being interviewed by a lady and he explained that they had something to do with Royal at the Market and then it clicked . I think they had those cups there !   The cashier / Barista was super friendly and shook my hand when meeting him. My only complaint was that he completely forgot to make our drinks so it took about 10 mins without anyone else ahead of us. He did redeem himself however by giving us free coffee cards for next time for the long wait .  I LOVE the space ! It is shared with Bison leather goods, Monorchid, and a cute succulent place with the calmest Boxer I have ever met . JB Snyder's work is on the wall and ties in the furnishings . So cute . The food also looked fantastic, but I didn't try it .
