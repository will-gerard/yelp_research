I went to the restaurant with a party of friends. Things were going well until my friend had a severe allergic reaction after taking one bite of her food. Turns out, there was cross contamination by way of the convection oven. Well, the manager never even apologized to her and they still charged her for the wine! They also made no effort to make sure she was okay despite being violently ill in the bathroom. Extremely poor customer service and there are health risks at this restaurant. None of my friends will be returning.

Always great service. Front desk ladies are super nice and the MRI technician (wish I knew his name) is a total sweetheart. Made me feel super comfortable going in to my MRI. I've had a few tests done there and it's been great every time.

AZ Pet Stylist is the most amazing grooming company! I contacted them because I was very anxious about leaving my maltipoo at a grooming salon. I had no way of knowing if she was okay. She's also very anxious so I decided to try mobile grooming. Best decision ever. Everyone at AZ Pet Stylist is super friendly and professional. The first time I had my dog groomed, Mandy let me see the trailer inside so I felt more comfortable. The grooming trailers are clean, professional and absolutely magnificent. I cannot say enough good things about this service! Mandy is a wonderful groomer and it's been a great experience.
