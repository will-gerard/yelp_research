With the wide array of desert plants at this Botanical Garden, I would already be a fan. We went to the members-only preview of the monumental art of Allan Houser there last night, and I must say that it made the preview all that much better. I did have a small lunch at the Patio Cafe there earlier in the day, and even though it was pretty much pre-packaged sandwiches, it certainly hit the spot after walking the entire grounds (which took about 2 hours)...

M Catering recently serviced a high-profile members-only museum opening at the Heard Museum, and did a wonderful job from what I could see as an attendee. They served some great customized tamales with goat cheese, another appetized with rice and duck that was quite nice, and a flan that was the talk of several tables of guests. If I was going to throw an event in Phoenix (Unlikely since I live in NM), I'd check this outfiy out.

OK, a lobster cobb salad for over $30 and one of the very best prime rib dinners I have EVER eaten (also over $30)...  If I had the time and the money, I could LIVE here. Sure we waited.  We waited long time. But Flemings love us long time too.  The calamari appetizer was cooked to perfection, and the special lobster bisque was equally incredible.  Our server was kinda hot, very eloquent, and easily served our table of twelve with no issues.  My biggest issue was with the party I was with because they simply didn't want to leave...    One of the greatest tourist restaurant experiences ever.  HOWEVER...  I have to ding this establishment a star for not having free/any wifi...  Because that's how we roll in the new millennium...  Try the pomegranate margarita.  SERIOUSLY.

This review is based on a 3 day stay at this hotel, "Resort" and doesn't reflect the "Villa" aspect of the stay. The meals are quite good at the Hotel's BlueFire Grille. The steaks and seafood were cooked to order and the presentation was lovely in the evening. The breakfast meals were acceptable, but the buffet was lacking a little bit. I personally loved the evening meals offered at the restaurants around the Hotel quite a bit. The swimming pool is advertised as heated, but I tend to doubt this, although a brisk swim after lounging in the hot tub was fun. Now the bad... The walls, doors, and vents in this building (originally built by Merve Griffin) are faulty. Faulty to the point that noise at any usual hotel or motel would mute it so it wouldn't disturb other guest's sleeping habits. When I was walking down the halls, I could hear people talking, snoring, and watching TV everywhere in the building. In my room I could hear the next door guests talking about their sports games or whatever, and I could hear the wake up alarms all go off in the morning across the halls while my room's door was closed. The building is also oddly designed to not allow guests to easily find ice machines, and good luck finding a vending machine, even for water. Finally on the last day, the weekend happened and the pool was too full of local people, who seem to view this hotel as a valid home vacation destination, and two different banquets that spilled out into the guest's areas... I liked the food, but it didn't seem like much of a vacation to me.

I dunno...  The service was great, and everyone else at my table was very content with their meal.  I wasn't.  I was told by two of the other people in my party that I "just ordered the wrong thing"...  I ordered the sausage link side and the omelet with the avocado and cheese and another side of potatoes.  The omelet was flat and bland.  The salsa that came with couldn't be helped even with the Louisiana hot sauces that were sitting on the table, and the best part of the meal was quite frankly the iced tea...  I tried logging on to the wifi with my iPod touch and was rejected even after getting the password too...  I probably won't go here again.

Finally a decent caterer for a one-time-event in the Phoenix area... At last night's catered event at the Desert Botanical Gardens, everyone was raving about the food, while it was still being served... The cheese and cracker presentation was fun, but the real star of the event was the taco-esque pork and tortilla dish that I loved... If you wanted a vegetarian option, there was a mediterranean take that was available... But really, everyone with any guts at all had a mix of both, which was divine.

Brilliant, and possibly my second favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale now. The food was exceedingly yummy, the service was excellent, the price was totally right on, and it's in the middle of town. What's not to love? I did ding it a star for the 25 minute wait we had to get in, but consider that simple logistics... Be warned that this is a VERY POPULAR spot to eat, so if you want solitude, you're going to the wrong place.

I'd never been here before, but it came highly recommended by Figarelli Galleries as a decent steak place, so we decided to give it a try. It was fun, and the food was pretty awesome. The service was quick and competant, and friendly enough even though we did stay a few minutes past their stated closing time... While all of us were hungry, none of us orded traditional entrees, preferring to eat appetizers instead. I had a delicious shrimp cocktail made with massive prawns, an incredible macaroni side dish that was great, and shared a coleslaw dish with a friend that we both agreed was quite good, even though neither of us arre fans of coleslaw per say... I think the overwhelming presence of carrots in the dish won both of us over. Yea, I'll come back, no problem.

This bar is right around the corner from the Double Down and has pinball, pool, and some pretty awesome music, at least the couple times I've been there. Funny thing is every time I've been here, I ALWAYS run into people I know from other states who I haven't seen if forever. It's sort of like the Eagle Tavern in Seattle or the Lone Star in San Francisco if you need a reference to better known places in larger cities.

The double Down is the ONLY bar in the entire city of Las Vegas that I totally endourse. Cheap drinks, video blackjack, good touring and local bands, how could you go wrong? Screw all that casino crapola. This is where it's at!

You gotta have a reservation in this world sometimes and keeping that in mind, Veneto Trattoria was able to make room for our modest party of seven this evening with little fuss. the restaurant was packed, and yet the service was reasonably swift with any of out wants and needs. Excellent appetizers and soups, so we ordered something everyone would like and shared. The appetizers ware also great and described adequately in the menu and everyone (except my uncle, who ordered the lasagna and wasn't impressed) was so happy by the end of the meal, that we all indulged in either a specialty dessert coffee or the excellent dessert special (Chocolate Soufle with vanilla ice cream which was flawless and had a great presentation. I'll come back here the next time I'm in town for business, that's for sure.

Make no bones about it, this is the eye of the storm when it comes to party hotels in Scottsdale... Indigo is surrounded by no less than 38 relatively high-profile bars, restaurants, and nightclubs within stumbling distance which has it's plusses and minuses... Let's start with the plusses: The entire staff is incredibly friendly. You won't find any sarchasm here. The heated pool is excellent. The communal lobby/bar is excellent, especially if you know about the hidden door. The isolated work out room is amazing, and hardley ever used. The shuttle service is beyond par. The minuses: On busy weekend nights, the entire building is surrounded by a maelstrom of activity until right around 3:00am... I spied security guards from some of the surrounding nightclubs smoking crack in the alcoves, and the noise level, while ignoreable is constant. The hallways, especially in the morning are very active, and the doors seem like they were designed to slam very loudly. The food in the restaurant is bearable, but is nothing special. The patrons all seem to expect this, and with the website name, how could you not understand the concept? The rooms are for the most part quite clean, although the grout in the bathrooms needs more maintenance. The shower in the "disabled" room that I saw had a bathtub with rails instead of a walk-in shower, which seemed backwards from most other "disabled" rooms I've ever had the pleasure to stay in. If you're a hipster, this place is totally for you. if you're not, go stay at the Hilton down the street... Although I've stayed there, and was really annoyed there to the nth's degree in comparrison...

If Bacon was in Santa Fe, I would eat there at least once a week. Our waiter was a little bit flighty, but he looked like eye candy to one of the people at our table, so that was forgiven. The food blew us all away. Thick slices of ham, perfect potatoes, homemade English muffins, and thick slabs of toasted bread rounded out every order, and that doesn't even include the entrees! The restaurant space itself was open and inviting, the patrons were cooler than cool, and even my 97 year-old grandmother sang praise on the restaurant days later... Highly, highly, highly recommended!

I was starving after a day of traveling and after traversing every gate in the airport, I settled on this place with my usual amount of heavy skepticism.  I mean really, airport food?  Ugh.  Well this time I made a good decision because I was actually impressed.  The service was friendly, although not the fastest because one of the people behind the scenes misplaced my food for a couple of minutes.  But the counter person realized this pretty quickly and went to find my shrimp tacos as soon as she saw that I was still hanging around.  Four shrimp tacos and a bottled water for $16 seems about right for airport food, and this food was good!  I even liked the seasoned fries, and I rarely like seasoned fries.  I'm going to keep this one on my list since I actually seem to hit the Phoenix airport a couple times a year.
