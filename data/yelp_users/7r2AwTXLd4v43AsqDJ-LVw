A super shop here, even for a Discount Tire store. These guys are exeptional professionals at all levels. I am probably the fussiest customer to please, and do all my reseach on line before purchasing most items. They answered knowlegebly and honestly in satisfying my concerns and questions with different tire brands. Most importantly they matched or bettered most competitors pricing I showed them. WOW! Just watching them work while waiting for your vehicle is like witnessing a carrier crew prepping fighters. Gabriele is the store manager who runs a tight ship. He leads by his own hard working example and ethics on the shop floor. Gabrielle is not the guy that hides behind a closed office door, like most bosses, and will perform most anything he asks his employees. His crew are always pleasant, polite and fast paced! His 3rd in charge, Josh- whom I have worked with from another Discount Tire location, remembered me, but also makes everyone he greets feel like an old friend. Remember all this and they will make the lowest or match most competitors in pricing. Then deliver beyond these expectations by: finishing on time, work quality done, shop cleanliness and client satisfaction. So try Gabriele and his team first with your next tire needs.Tell them Angelo from Yelp sent you...

Hmm... you purchased a new VW and found out your service department is awful. Well... do I have a service representative and dealership for you. His name is Chris Karhs and he works over at Berg VW in Mesa. He is old school honest, straight to the point, and cares about client satisfaction. Most recently, our Passat developed battery failure. We called him first and the service dept immediately answered our call, advised us on our warranty, replacement choices and got us back on the road. This service department is polite, curtious, and work together as a professional team. We have never gone to voice mail when calling Chris. We never experienced service overselling or job overcharging either here. We are informed and demanding car owners-respectful always, but hold high expectations when promised job complition in the time agreed and done correctly the first time. So for about a year that we have been going here, they have been very fair with pricing and actually competitive for the repair quality and time line promptness with all work competed. Most importantly... our Passat is always given back running better and cleaner then we left it at service. If you call Chris and he is not available, other team members help determine your cars needs and Chris will call back ASAP, briefed and prepared to solve your car's issue. He has helped us feel more confident in our Passat TDI choice (especially from all the recent negative press) and that VW will have the fix soon for all TDI owners. Call Chris next time you require warranty/scheduled service or repairs on your VW, and you will be pleased to have done so.

So, a little late posting after our 2014 TDI Passat's recent service with Berge VW in Mesa.   Well, once again we received top notch/perfect service by Chris Karhs. You must call and use Chris, if you have any VW serve needs or questions with any Volkswagen of any age or model.   This guy is so amazing with his knowledge, honesty and being respectful to clients. He goes so far beyond any service person we have met in many years and at any dealership. Saved us from trading in our TDI VW for another maker after all the recent smog controversy.  Even ask Chris questions about other VW needs/ services you may require-he knows so many VW related people/businesses around town. Chris is better then using GOOGLE!  My wife Sara, actually is not put off about going to a dealer or doing things herself with her TDI Passat that helps me rest easier! If Chris ever leaves this Berge dealership, yes other service people are good and helpfully-but Chris is very old school client centered. Sara will be really disappointed, sad and we would probably have to follow him to his next VW dealership.   Hopefully Berge VW appreciates his extra efforts and that will never happen!  Call Chris and find out for yourself!  Thanks all for reading, Angelo & Sara

Probably one the best chinese food restaurants this side of town. Reasonably priced for the quality, taste and large menu portions served. Small place if you are thinking of dinning inside. Most people pick up food to eat at home. Our family has been ordering take out from them for over 7 years and always delicious. Even visiting  family or friends ask if we can order from IRON Chef.  Maybe our gusts just don't like our cooking?! No...it's the delicious Chinese food at Iron Chef.

Only sharing for service. Watch out for this service dept. Very up selling on major work to be done if car's out of warrenty. dealer does offer great service deals with coupons that come up from time to time. Very polite and accomodating staff though. Just stick to your budget or at very least get a second opinion if quoted a larger problem or price then you thought. Subaru dealership in Phoenix off central is the best in town. High quality work for prices- even if a little bit of a drive away.

Purchased our new 2014 vw passat tdi here last year. Tough negotiations... but expected. Most dealers in Phoenix are in the know that competion is limited in AZ. Still ended up with the best deal in town. Looked for 2 weeks before made the sale here. They are about a 3* if you have a good sales person. Do your homework going in and stick to your budget. Service department is really horrible-1*. They fight to do as little as possible. No loaner either. What? How could vw allow that?! Service dept at Burge VW is the best we have used... and that is still way below par then most other brands. Make the best deal, if you are stuck on VW, then take your new car to Burge service. They try thier best. My wife loves her car... but we'll see how it lasts with such poor and expensive service attitudes of VW dealers. Something to consider- no matter how great the vehicle. Extended warrenty is expensive as h### and limited in coverage compared to Korean, Japaneese or Ford brands. All cars will need service-even when brand new! Shame on VW service! If they dont back the car's workmanship/reliability... why buy? So why overall in our experience for this dealership is only a 2*!

Wow! Can't get any closer to Chicago. Queen Creek is now the place for Great stuffed pizza. Sandwiches are unreal . Prices a value for the guality and freshness. Food was all cooked to order and service super friendly. Pizza needed a tad more spices though. Still-all super fresh and served very hot! Must give 45 min to cook the deep dish pizzas to order... but worth the wait! Really busy place. Owners and staff make you feel at home... even if you're not from Chi town.
