Ive heard tons of great things about this place. I decided to get the #1 Two Chicken Enchiladas with beans and rice and it was bleeeeeeegh. I got a spoonful of so-so rice, beans that tasted like they had just come from a can and the enchiladas were even worse.   Normally I dont give places second chances, but the service was good, and the place was very clean. I might try the chorizo or the carne asada next time. Definitely will avoid the enchiladas.

C-P Que???  I thought this place was supposed to be fantastic. I had a personal steak, pesto and onion pizza that was just average. $13 a pizza is not average though.   Not that good, and too expensive.

Ok, they've made up for that first pizza. I had the Mango Tandoori Chicken Pizza and it was delicious. I even ate the crust, and I never eat the crust!  This pizza really was worth the price. I'll definitely go there again.

Why so many bad reviews!  I've had most of the items on the menu. The happy hour is awesome, too bad there's no happy hour on Saturdays, thats really lame.   Other than that, the service is always great, hostesses and waiters are always friendly no matter how intoxicated our crowd is. The boneless wings are tasty and spicy and the artichoke dip is good with anything.   Dont get Bahama Mama's or you will be called a wuss, forever. Long Island Iced Tea's are ok and the prices on beer are decent. For a while they had 2 for 1 shots of Patron....ah that was great. Contrary to popular belief, Patron and mozarella sticks DO mix.

All the things I tried had names I couldnt pronounce or understand but it was all great. Very very spicy but delicious. My eyes were tearing up, my nose running, my throat and mouth on fire and yet I kept on eating because it was just so good.   Service was excellent, Mike, the hispanic/asian guy needs a raise. I found out that the glass dragon everyone talks about consists of hundreds of individual pieces that all had to be hanged individually and took weeks to put together.  A little known secret: Try the avocado ice cream. Yes I know it sounds gross, dont be a wuss and just try it, its very good. I even bought a quart to take home.

My buddy told me about this place. He said "dude we gotta go there" and so we did. We had a pitcher of Kilt Lifter for about $12.50. I dont usually buy pitchers so I dont know about the price but since he said they brew it there I guess the price is ok. The beer battered fries were good and the fish and chips was served really hot. Its very convinient that there is a blue bus line running through there, no need for DD. Great for groups!

Forget the fact that virtually all fast food tastes like heaven after a long night of partying. I've been to this location in varying states of intoxication and they have always provided top notch customer service, even though its 3:30am, I'm probably still drunk and probably talking too loud or not making much sense. The people there always have a big smile and treat all their customers very very well. I would recommend this place to any college student in a late night quest for greasy, tasty, delicious food.  The one thing I would recommend is that you specify that your chicken is fresh, and by that I mean that it hasnt been sitting in the warmer for any longer than 5minutes. However that is something you should do at every fast food place.

Awesome place. Great atmosphere. I've been there a couple of times, on the weekends and in the middle of the week. Not exactly a place to mingle as it gets really loud, but if youre with a bunch of people you know you should have a nice time.   Last time I went there was on a Tuesday and it was actually kinda busy. It was my friend's 21st bday and he did the whole getting on the stage thing. He tried to dance, but he wasnt that drunk yet. Afterwards someone gave him a 252 which he threw up almost right away. It wasnt chunky, and it wasnt a lot, but rules are rules. One of the bouncers followed him to the bathroom a little later and nicely asked us to leave. I have never been kicked out of a place in such a polite way before. (not that I get kicked out very often) We ended up running into the same bouncer at the Cue Club a few minutes later and he was cool and took a picture with us. All things considered, we had a good time. Don't Stop Believing, Piano Man and YMCA were some of the songs playing, and I'm pretty sure I ordered 3 drinks but only got charged for 2.

Yes I've experienced better Chipotles. This location is always busy so when we order lunch for the office we fill out the fax sheet. Kinda hard to screw that up but somehow they did. My co-worker crossed out both squares for the beans, which clearly means NO BEANS. Well she got both black and pinto beans. She also complained that she didnt get enough meat.   My order wasnt screwed up but about halfway through my bowl I kept asking myself  "where the f is the meat." After digging some more there was still barely any meat.   We have eaten at that location several times and although the food is always good, they often times manage to screw something up. Never big screw ups but something is always off.   No complains about the Alma School and Queen Creek location.  Pluses: Nice location, liquor license!

Good:  Excellent customer service, those ladies are about as nice as you can be without sounding fake. They always remember my name.  Good suggestions, I refuse to learn what all those coffee terms mean, blended, cappuccino, whatever. I just tell them I want something cold, sweet and with a kick, and they always recommend something I end up liking. I've been on a pumkin something run lately. It rocks.   Free wi-fi. None of that bs that other places do.   Bad:  I can usually find at least something to complain about but I'm coming up short here. I havent tried the food yet so who knows.     Try it out!

I tried the food. The croissant ham and cheese and the turkey and cheese are a little greasy, but they hit the spot. The bagel egg bacon and cheese sandwich ok too. I still really like this place.

I have been to this McDuffy's quite a few times. They are solid. Waitresses are nice, bartenders are nice, the owner is always more than happy to chat with the customers. I have had most of the items on the menu. I liked all of them except for the turkey avocado wrap, but thats my fault because I dont usually like wraps, what was I thinking?  Anyway, cerveza, good service and good food. No complains. I encourage anyone to try it out.

A place that needs no introduction. 24 hours service, hot good food and cheap prices. Cant ask for much more. Once they added a few tapatio bottles around the restaurant it became perfect. What they lack in high quality they more than make up in quantity and price. I would recommend this place to anyone at anytime.

Head's up!  Since it just opened they are selling 18" one topping pizzas (or pie's as the owner called them) for $10, tax included.  My buddy and I came in looking for something quick and simple to fill the gut and hit the bars later. We werent counting on some serious pizza action. We got that special, it was served piping hot with just pepperoni. It was one of the best pizzas ive had in this side of town. The owner told us about the preparation and was very friendly and seemed very proud of his business. They'll start serving salads soon so I'll update on that then.   They have a challenge for who can eat a very large pizza. If you can eat a 28" pizza "loaded with 3 pounds of cheese" you get the pizza for free, get your picture on the wall and you get a "I ate the whole 28" t-shirt. I don't plan on trying this anytime soon, but it seemed interesting.   We hit the bars later, and it was really nice to have that half a 18" pizza there to help me along.   They also have lunch specials, subs, salads, calzones and some other sides.

Wow first one star.  This rating is for the service, not the food.  According to James Blake, Subway tastes the same in Shanghai, New York and London.  Although most people dont like their jobs, the ladies that work at this particular location really really hate theirs. The sandwiches are sloppy, little to no eye contact, and not one single smile. I'm not saying I want Mrs Personality making my food, but if I wanted to order through a robot I would have gone to Arbys (some of them now have automated ordering machines, they look like ATM's and you can customize your orders, pay, and just wait for your number to be called)   And something else. The stupid 5 dollar foot long song. Seriously, I HATE IT!
