I can't even begin to put into words how much I LOVE Hula's! I've even told my other half that if Hulas were a man, I'd marry him in a heartbeat! Everything I've eaten here has been the most delicious thing I've stuffed into my grubby little face. And don't even get me started on the cocktails. Seriously...I have nothing more to say than, go! Just go and experience the wonderful things that Hula's has to offer.

Can someone PLEASE get these people a new phone! My boyfriend called in our order both times we've had pizza here and it seems to be this big ordeal just to get the girl on the other line to hear our order correctly. Each time they've added a whole extra pizza to our order that we never asked for. On top of that, we were told our pizza would be ready 30min, so we LEFT OUR HOUSE about 30 to 40minutes after placing our order. At that point we expected to have our pizza ready, if not coming soon after arrival. Low and behold, we were left waiting for another 20 for a lukewarm pizza that was less than exciting. Now, it wasn't terrible...but it wasn't the best either. Heck I'm sure it would have been a great pizza if it didn't taste like it sat under a heating lamp for the day. More than anything, if it weren't for their bumbling mistakes, I'm sure we'd be back more often.

Baja Joe? More like Baja NO!  The food is like any other run of the mill Mexican food restaurant out there. Nothing really to write home about but it isn't terrible either.  The one thing I have to complain about thought is the AWFUL service! As soon as our food came out, our server couldn't be bothered to grab us water or even our check once our meal was done. We sat for at least 15min after someone else came to clear our table before our server even came back to check in on us. Once we could finally grab her attention she dropped the check, I instantly put my card down and said it was ready for her to take, she glared at me and walked away without even picking up our payment. RUDE! Seriously, costumer service can make or break an experience and the lack of attention (in a nearly empty restaurant) is inexcusable. I always try to cut servers slack because I know bad days happen, but you've got to draw the line somewhere. I for one, have no desire to give this place another shot.

I REALLY wanted to love this place but lo and behold, I find myself wishing I had decided on another destination for dinner. When my boyfriend and I arrived, we were quickly welcomed and seated in what was a perfectly quaint little corner of the restaurant. Unfortunately, that was about the only thing that was done in a timely manner during our visit.   We took a few minutes to decide what we wanted, ordered, and then hung out for about 15 to 20 minutes. During that time, two other parties were seated, orders were taken and their starters were brought out before ours! Did I mention that our waiter had to come back and ask us what we ordered because he forgot? We finally got our spring rolls but then had to wait another 20minutes for our dinner to arrive. I'm all about waiting for a meal that is cooked to order, but what really put the nail in the coffin was the fact that our food came out lukewarm (if that).  The food itself wasn't terrible, but its not something that I'll ever go out of my way to get. We got the tuna and salmon spring rolls and they were great. The cuts of fish could have been bigger but overall, they were the shinning star of a poorly cast ensemble. My boyfriend ordered the tofu and shiitake mushroom sandwich and said it was "good enough". Now, he isn't nearly as picky of an eater as I am, so "good enough" is as good as...well, bad. I ordered the chicken pho. The broth tasted like soapy water and the chicken looked like it was wadded up and boiled. Parts of the chicken didn't even seem fully cooked.  I wish we had a better experience at Rice Paper, but sadly I don't think we'll be back.

Earlier this year, I won a certificate for 3month membership to Urban WarFit at a zumbathon. After putting it off for a few months, I decided to finally cash in my certificate and give this crossfit thing a shot. I mean, don't get me wrong, up to this point I was very excited to try it out but I wasn't going to go "drinking the kool aid" as they say. I had planned on using up my free trial but planned to go back to my regular group fitness classes where I knew no one after attending hundreds of classes, and had an instructor who would probably never recognize me outside of his class.  Once I mustered up enough courage to visit  UWF, I came in on a Saturday for the free 9am class. Yeah, you heard me. FREE. (Come in and check it out sometime! And bring a friend.) Rob, coach and owner, lead a fun and engaging class that day. The dude knows his stuff! My first day in there and I was flipping massive tires and playing with atlas stones, it was amazing! From that day on, I continued to visit UWF 4-5 times a week for three months.  Fast forward to today, my three month free trial has since run up. There are at least 4 crossfit boxes much closer to my home than UWF. I have to wake up super early to go workout before work or come home way later than I would like if I go after work since I live (at minimum) 30min away. All that being said, I could never see myself calling any other box home. UWF IS THAT AMAZING!!!! All the coaches are so encouraging and knowledgeable. I've never met a group of people so excited to see other succeed! I've seen more change in my health in these past few months than I have in the past year of hitting the gym regularly. And the members of UWF are not just fellow gym goers, they've become great friends and family (the old Olive Garden slogan of "when you're here, you're family" seems to come to mind).  On top of that, the gym is well equipped and clean and has everything you need to meet your fitness goals. Oh! And if you're looking for the whole health and wellness package, Rob is a master at putting together effective meal plans to pair with your workouts that'll get you to your goals. Seriously, if you've spent the time reading this long winded review, just do yourself a favor and get your butt into Urban WarFit Crossfit NOW!!! (Yeah, I drank the kool aid. Heck, I'm swimming in it.)  But in all seriousness, every day that I spend at Urban WarFit is a day that I've invested in my own health and happiness. UWF has changed my life and I couldn't be more thankful for the coaches and athletes who have all welcomed me with open arms. Check it out for yourself.

I've only been here once and had a great experience, but the true test of a great restaurant, in my humble opinion, is consistency so a five star review might be on the horizon for Timo.  First off, the ambiance is awesome! Love the decor, the outdoor seating and being able to see the wood fire oven in action in restaurants is always a nice touch in my book.  My boyfriend and I went there for dinner. The server we had was attentive, taking our drink orders in a timely manner and didn't make us feel like we were rushed when we took our time looking at the dinner menu. I ordered the ceder plank salmon. It was cooked to perfection, the glaze was a great compliment to the great cut of fish and the sides were awesome. It came with garlic kale which (my ONLY complaint) may have been a tad bit too salty, and a hearty portion of couscous. My boyfriend ordered the lemon oregano chicken. I forgot what else came with it but that too was delicious! The portions were filling, but of course, we made room for dessert. We shared the peach cobbler and were not disappointed. In fact, I would go there just for the cobbler...and a few glasses of wine!   The wait for food was a little on the lengthy side, but it was worth it! I will never take speed over quality of food so if I've got to wait for a fantastic meal, then wait I will.  If you're looking to enjoy a leisurely dinner with great company then this is the place for you. I can't wait to go back for more.

I've been to many nail salons in my years and I am BEYOND picky with who touches my feet, and this one is right up there with some of the best. Its a new salon so its got all the new pedi chairs and nail equipment. They're a little short staffed (again because they just opened) but the lady that was helping me while I waited kept checking in so that I knew I hadn't been forgotten. I had to wait for a bit for my services to get started but I'll let that slide until thy get more people in there working. My tech was very nice and very particular about his work which is great knowing that they actually care about the quality of service that they're giving. And let me tell you, I got one mean foot rub! The lotion was heated, the towels were steamy and the hot rocks were actually used properly unlike other places...and as a massage therapist, I'm hard pressed to ever rave about a nail salon foot massage! Other than the wait, they were great.

We get it. Self serve froyo is pretty darn good. But Twirl? Twirl is an experience beyond anything else those other self serve places have to offer. I mean, nutella froyo? Carmel macchiato? Parline? Those are only but a few of my favorite flavors but they have so much more to offer that it will leave you BEGGING for more. The yogurt itself isn't overpoweringly sweet like most other places I've been to which is a huge plus in my book. I think there could be more variety when it comes to the toppings, but with their offerings of yogurt, I usually opt to go sans extras.  The decor is really funky and has this great ambiance. You get off kind of a coffee shop vibe when you're there. You know, the kind of place you can sit and chat with you friends for a couple of hours in a really comfortable setting. Or even just kick back and read or take in the day. It's really mellow and hip. I can appreciate a place that puts as much thought into there product as well as their presentation.  If you haven't tried this place out yet, why don't you give it a TWIRL? ;)

Just save yourself that time and money and go to Chipotle! The service here was so bad and the food was, at best, mediocre. The salsa lacked in flavor and the rice was painfully undercooked. We dined in and not once did anyone come out a clean off the tables. This establishment is a dump and I would be ok with never setting foot in this place ever again.
