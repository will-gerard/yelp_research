Got kicked out of Fridays First Row! What a bunch of pieces of craps! We only had 2 rounds of drinks there, we weren't being loud or obnoxious, the place was practically empty and the manager couldn't give us a satisfactory answer as to why we were being dismissed. The only thing he kept repeating was "I have to back his bartenders." WTF?! It's cool to have a manager to back you up like this but c'mon guy! YOU didn't even notice anything out of the ordinary from our group, you were right there!!! WE WERE NOT DRUNK OR LOUD!   Even thought that was our last drink there, it still pissed us off. Needless to say, they didn't deserve a tip and we took our business to a place that appreciates having a good group of day drinkers at their empty establishments on a slow Saturday afternoon. In downtown Phoenix, it wasn't hard to find the next spot...  *** Da Bafroom: Sorry folks, we were not there long enough to make this visit.  But I'm sure it stinks just as bad as the serivce we got though!

What a NIGHT!!! Lady's night on Wednesdays with awesome drink specials from 6-10 and it's not all cock fest! The people are really cool, none of this stuck up Snotsdale crap, and the staff is cool too. I got rocked my first night there and don't remember how I ended up where I woke up the next morning!!! I'M KIDDING, I'm not that big of a lush, sheesh, but it was definitely a fun night and will be back. It's also amazing how they mix Country music with Rap and everyone got along fine all night. Not one fight, surprisingly enough.   ***The Bafroom: The bathrooms were clean. We had a bathroom attendant, which I think is always annoying to have because I can get my own paper towel or push the blow dryer button myself. They have this funny urinal section that's like a big long tub that wraps around the corner and it's community so there are no dividers for the curious on-lookers. That confrontation could be quite odd but interesting with your hands full if you notice someone trying to take a peak! Do you attack with the resource at hand? Do you finish first and then confront? Do you wait for him to finish to confront? WHAT?!?! Am I thinking about this too much? lol Don't get me wrong, they do have stalls and 2 other private urinals to choose from. TAKE YOUR PICK :)

It was about a month ago when I was there. It's a cash bar only and the ATM was broken!  :{ grrrrrr  Good thing I had a 20 spot on me because I probably saved myself from having to washing dishes or something! The inside was kinda small and there was only one pool table but the patio was HUGE with a sand volley ball court. The perimeter wall was painted with a tropical/beach theme. The place has potential, just not on the night I went on.  ***The Bafroom: I didn't last too long at this place so a bathroom visit was not necessary. If there was one there (which I'm sure there was one somewhere) it didn't stand out. I did notice some unmarked doors by the entrance so maybe that's where it was. Kind of a funky spot but... The whole place was kind of a crap hole and being that it's in Casa Grande I'm sure you coulda just picked a bush or a corner and do your thing and no one woulda thought twice about what just happened!   "Giddy up, y'all! You're in Casa Grandy!"  ;)  Wudda ya expect?!?! LOL

This place is growing on me! A few more visits and it'll be like my Cheer's Bar. Always cool people here (none of this stuck up Snotsdale crap) and all the bartenders are cool here too. They have bar games such as darts (4 machines) and about another 4 or 5 pool tables. They also have karaoke a few nights a week with a pretty decent selection. I hear their wings are bomb and HUGE as in they somehow have access to mutant chickens with big muskles (yes, muskles). OOOOH! And how can I forget! THEY SERVE FREE POPCORN!!! They make it fresh there so don't assume it's stale like I did. Anyhow, if you see me there, don't hesitate to stop by and say WASSSUUUUUPPPP! And if you're a lady and see me there, don't hesitate to stop by and give me a hug :)   ***Da BAfroom: Holy Moly! TWO BAFFFFROOMS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE?!?! GET THE EFFFFF OUTTA HERE! In such a small location, they have 2 restrooms! Actually, this place isn't really that small. Alright, so I'll break this down for you so it's easier to swallow. The main restrooms are on the bar side; for him and for her. In the other room where the pool tables are there's a co-ed bathroom (yes, yes) AND the only place for males to take care of any sit-down duties (or dooties). Also, for the men: we need to keep in mind this is the only place for us to puke our guts out if we get to that point so lets be clean about it when we use this room for the convenience factor. I'm just thinking ahead but not from personal experience... yet.  In conclusion, both restrooms have the same interior design which is nicely done and has a pleasant aroma lingering throughout. I believe the hand soap is good smelling foam stuff too...

A karaoke bar on a Saturday night?! Get outta here! This place rocked. A little too packed though. The best way to describe the floor plan for this place is it's like an hour glass. It gets congested in the middle (where the bar starts and the drink prices are kinda pricey) so if you're trying to get from the front to the back, where all the action is, be a little patient; good things come to those who wait. There's also a nice patio for those people looking to get some fresh air or take a break from all the action. The karaoke host doesn't quite stick to the order in which your song request is submitted (some people sang twice before I got my ONE chance). All in all, it was a fun spot and most of the people there were cool; not what I had expected based on previous experiences I've had in that area. THUMBS UP FOR THAT! Oh yah, I also got to meet some fellow Yelpers there too who, which was the cherry on top! I'll definitely be found there again messing up more songs for public entertainment. nAcHo: Coming soon to a karaoke bar near you!!!   ***Da Bafroom: 4 stars for the bafroom! WOO HOO!!! A delightful aroma streamed throughout this miniature suite adding to the already pleasant experience I was having. The interior design/decoration was up-to-date with tiled walls, 2 fancy new urinals and one bathroom stall for those looking to participate in "floor mounted porcelain activities". Bathroom soap was definitely Dial (TM) or an imitation Dial Liquid Soap which, for this place and it's location, I would have expected something more fancy and better smelling like Body Works soap or Bed Bath and Beyond stuff. OH, who am I now??? I'm nAcHo, the Yelp Bafroom Extraordinaire, that's who! Sorry, (compose yourself, compose yourself...) I guess I felt a little spoiled being in sucha nice restroom...

This place is one of my Cheer's bars. You can conveniently find my brother and myself effin' up karaoke all night anywhere in town but usually here on Sunday nights. The people that usually show up here are pretty cool and kick back and you get the occasional weirdo who walks in and entertains until he gets kicked out. It's also a great spot to get a variety of entertainment thru-out the week. They have a local amateur comedy night on Tuesday (which I've yet to attend and partake in) and a new country open mic night, LIVE MUSIC on the weekends with the occasional BIG NAME comedians that roll thru town. In addition, they also offer other miscellaneous bar activities thru-out the week like beer pong, duck races, etc. The bar back staff is aways cool (HI MARY!!!) and the food is pretty good too (if you're constipated and in need of relief....) I KID! IT'S GOOD, I promise...   FOR MUSICIANS: From a musician's view point, this place has an awesome sound system and usually has a good in-house sound guy to add to your sound. My old band played here a couple of times before we broke up and we were always satisfied with the sound quality.   ***The Bafroom: Ah yes, my infamous bathroom report. Liz, I love you and your bar but as my public duty and fiduciary responsibility to fellow Yelper, your bathroom doesn't rank the highest; DEFINITELY NOT the lowest either. It's a basic bathroom that takes care of business; nothing more, nothing less. Oh yah, they recently installed a new modern urinal! Looks like a GIANT egg with a hole cut in it but it's designed like that to help reduce splash, I assume. (LOL) Good thinking ;) I always hated coming out all soaked and (I keed, I keed lol). I also wish we had the nice purdy flowers painted on the entry wall, like the ladies do, to set us in a different mind set as we walk in to take care of business. It's a psychological thing. Or how about some clouds and some sunshine and, and, and.... okay, maybe I went too far on this... I LIKE YOUR FOAM SOAP?!?! :)

How do you describe a pasty to someone who doesn't know what one is??? I like to say it's more like a "Gourmet Hot Pocket" but bigger!!! That's the best description I have. I love this place and have yet to visit the new location in Mesa, which is now more convenient for me. This location will always be a classic. The staff is "ALWAYS" cool. It's kind of a weird set up. The suite is a very narrow rectangle that spans from end-to-end of the building so the space is limited but they made the best of it. You can tell the crew is a unique one and you can see they all understand each other and their duties as they would have to, being that they are constantly on top and all over each other (NOT LIKE THAT! GET YOUR MIND OUTTA THE GUTTER!). It's actually quite entertaining though! They also have great music playing most of the time and serve beer! You really have to go and check it out for yourself; there's no place like it. My goal is to one day try all the different pasty's.   ***Da Bafroom: Mr. Pasty, may I call you Cornish? You got lucky this time! Of all the times I've been to this Establishment, I've not ONCE EVER been to the restroom. I use to work right down the street so all my restroom needs were always satisfied before hand. Being I'm no longer employed there and my new duty to the Yelp community is "BAFROOMS", oh yes my friend, you bet I'll be payin a visit to the porcelain suite of your establishment. I don't anticipate any disappointments by any means but there will be an update on this section soon enough.

I love the pharmacy staff at this Fry's! Mr. Patel is a great Pharmacist as is the other lady and are very helpful and knowledgeable. They have a great staff behind them who take care of bidniz too! There's one I think is really cute but I don't see her there that often anymore :(   ***The Bafroom: I also had an interesting bathroom experience here one early morning. After a long night of drinking and avoiding an old friend all night that was trying hard to hook up with me, I finally made my way out off that house party all 007/Mission Impossible style! My ride left early like around 3:00am and at about 5:00am I finally made my escape. It was a quarter to 6 when I finally made my way to this same Fry's with the most unbearable urge to go #2! I found out the hard way that they don't open their doors until 6:00am and I had 15 minute left and was already doing the #2 shuffle dance outside the store. I banged on the glass door flashing my I.D. to show them I come in peace and mean no harm and finally someone had let me in early. Phewwww, was it a close call! Needless to say, I must have passed out on the crapper for at least 20 before I caught consciousness and realized where I was and what I needed to do to complete this mission. I finished up my business and I was on my way. The bathrooms were clean and I was never bothered during my nap. Great bathroom experience. I give their bathrooms 5 stars too! Thanks Fry's/Krogers!

Not bad for a couple of white guys opening up a Mexican joint! I guess the words Mexican and joint back-to-back can be misleading! So I'll rephrase that with Hippie style restaurant with a hint of Mexican food. They definitely have Mexicans in the kitchen cooking so you can trust this place knows what they are doing at least! These Hippie are kinda smart :) The concept is different than what you would normally expect (but the name of this place should shine some light and give an environmental foreshadow) and the food is "far out, man!" Being Mexican myself, it's got my approval.   The inside where you place your order gets crowded and is a small little area. The service is pretty good, they claim all the ingredients are "organic" and it does taste mighty yummy! Their fruit drinks are excellent too! The price is above average in comparison I think but bearable I guess.   ***The Bafroom: GOOD LUCK if you find yourself having the urge to use the restroom for anything! This is an outdoor eating environment and I didn't see any restrooms anywhere so no review on this. If you can correct me on this and lead me to my ultimate destination, please do and I will update this at a later date. In the meantime, better have some wet naps or Purell to sanitize your hands if you're a germ freak!
