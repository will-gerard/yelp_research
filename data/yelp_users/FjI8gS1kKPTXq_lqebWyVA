I'm not sure where I should start.  Maybe the fact that it took them three  weeks to get artwork to me.  Maybe I should start with that I was told I was being charged a $50 mark art work but was actually charged $550 for signs when I haven't even picked our the type of sign material I wanted yet.  Or maybe I should talk about how the owner did not accept any responsibility.  Or maybe I should talk about how they only completed half of the order and then completed the other half a week later and never bothered to tell me. Or maybe I should talk about the fact that we told me I could go **%* my mother.  Beside that I guess overall it was a pretty good experience.

Saw the Yelp Ad (75$ for only $50) -called to make an appointment and they had me in and out in the same day.  Charged what they quoted me and did an excellent job!  I'm very please with the service and work!

The food is excellent but the service is horrible.  If the service was even just ok I'd give them 5 stars

Having to ask 4 times for water is never a good sign. Its also not great when your food is delivered after the two tables next you who actually sat down after you ordered already... Seriously, this was bad.    Mediocre food, poor service and a manager that just didn't care... Bad combo. I won't be back

let me start with this: I hate bad service. I mean I really HATE it... I am tired of server's who don't get customer service.  At the end of the day, the food is pretty good but the service there is mediocre to horrible depending on when you're there.  I don't think I will be going back there.

If I could give zero stars I would.  They just don't care about customer service and are super apathetic.

Amazing food and great service.  I highly reccomend sitting at the counter on your first visit so you can watch the food being prepared.  If you're into great tasting food then this is your place.  If you get the chance try the leaks, they're fantastic.

What an awful experience with this company.  Had a service call (through my home warranty) for my dishwasher.  One the first trip the technician decided the problem was a hose needed to be replaced.  So he left and returned (and left us with a mess that he made)  and when he returned a few days later it turned out the part he had to order wasn't even necessary.  He then "fixed" the problem only for me to find out later that day the problem was not corrected at all.  A manager called me the following day and was rude, unapologetic and could not get another more capable technician to our home to fix the issue within the time we requested.  Bottom line is the workmanship was poor and the customer service was even worse! STAY AWAY

Great grass-fed burgers!  Hands down the best burgers in Phoenix.  Very creative and more importantly Grass-fed.

Draft reviews are dumb. You should be able to post the review from your phone. OK now on to the real review..  The only complaint I have about this place is that if you order your burger with no bun it gets too messy and isn't as tasty as other places..however the burgers overall are great.  I've been back twice since my first visit and will return.  Another great concept by Fox

As Realtor myself I can tell you that Wendy is one of the best.  Not only does she deliver the results her clients are looking for, she does so in way that represents her clients to the max.

Love this car wash.  The price is right, the service is always good and the vacums actually work (unusual for a car wash)

Dr. Steve is the best.  I went to see him after an injury got the best of me.  While others were advising I go a more "traditional" route of getting a shot in my back to relieve the pain and tension Dr. Steve had me stick it out and in just a few weeks my back was better than before.  I make it a point to go to Dr. Steve's location whenever possible.

This place was great.  We tried the chips, fries, and tater tots with our burgers and have no complaints.  The price is great and other than I wish the burger patty was bigger I love this place!

I really wanted to like this place because its hard to find grassfed beef in most restaurants but he first time I checked out Coal Burger I thought it was over priced and not very tasty.  When I went back to give them another chance my original thoughts were validated.

I have been to a lot of gyms and this one is TOP NOTCH!  Derek & Brian run a great gym and its easy to see why this place is growing so quickly.   If you're thinking of joining a CrossFit gym, CrossFit480 is the only place to go!

Lets face it, not all CrossFit gyms are created equal and not all head coaches are created equal.  The team at CF480 is the best of the best and more importantly they care about their gym members and the community in the gym is a reflection of that.  There are a ton of CrossFit gyms to choose from in North Scottsdale, but CrossFit 480 is the the obvious choice!  Check them out for yourself and you'll see exactly what I am talking about.

OK this might be my new favorite burger in town.  The burger is about as tasty as can be.  I highly recomend adding bacon and the saut√©ed onions.  I haven't tried the fires but I'm not much of a french fry person.  I have however had the beef taco and like the burger its excellent.  The customer service could be improved upon but I'm not going to give them lesser review because of it as the food makes up for it (which is rare for me to say).   This is a can't miss place if you like burgers or tacos.

I had the opportunity to have a consultation with Mr. Nielsen and in that (free) 45 minute session I learned so much that he earned my business on the spot.  Since then his staff has been extremely attentive and ready, willing , and able to help.  I appreciate the level of customer service and follow up the Nielsen Law Group provides.

Let me be clear. The food is excellent but the staff doesn't care about being prepared (dirty tables, no ice tea brewed an hour after opening, missed orders, everyone at table getting served at different times 10+ minutes apart) I won't be back to this location.   I'm not sure how this place runs so smooth in Austin and completely sucks in Scottsdale

Updated:  6-1-14  I will update this review after/we return.  First bad sign was at the register.  The girl taking our order was ok but not exactly customer service oriented or friendly.  We ordered 3 appetizers so we could try a few different.   Finally after 25 minutes 1 of the appetizers showed up (Mac n cheese balls). They were pretty good. Not amazing but good. About 5 minutes later our kale salad arrived.  I will say that the kale salad was fantastic. If I return again I'll order it for sure.  We were told our 3rd item (pretzels)  was going to be "right out". Well 20 minutes later (55 minutes total) they still haven't been delivered, no one has checked on us and our daughter is done sitting still so it's time go.   I understand things happen in a restaurant but if you can't a soft pretzel taken care of in under an hour after you've been fully aware that there was an issue with this order 25 minutes in then you've got serious problems.    We really wanted to like this place.  It's got great outdoor seating and is right around the corner from my house.  Not sure yet if I'll give them another chance.  If I do. I'll update this review.   Update : went back a 2nd time and had an equally disappointing experience.  We want to like this place but I can't imagine returning.

First off I'm a sucker for a business owned by locals, I love that they are using organic and non-GMO ingredients.  That being said the shakes are awesome.  Personally I like mixing peanut butter cup and Oreos but I can't wait to try a few of the items on the menu.

Angelo is awesome.  Can't say enough good things about him.  Since day 1 he was informative and has always given great advice and helped out.  No better Cryo lab in town

I had heard good things about these guys but its almost impossible to believe until you actually seem the guys hustle back and fourth.  Its almost as if they don't know they're getting paid by the hour.  I personally love good service and am willing to pay a premium for it these guys are reasonable on price and exceptional on service.  Give them a shot and you won't regret it.

Had an issue on a Sunday morning with the garage door and wasn't sure who to call so I looked on Yelp. They answered right away and said they could be here in a few hours (they actually showed up a little earlier than expected which was nice.  They fixed the door and was in and out in about 45 minutes and was very fair on price in my opinion (especially given it was a Sunday and I needed help ASAP). I would recommend APEX to anyone needing garage door help.

Great little taco spot.  Really good service, prices are decent and I love the salsa bar as well.   The customer service actually won me over but the food is legit. Mexican food is one of my favorites if not my favorite place and for a quick little fast food joint this place can't be beat.  Do yourself a favor and try this place out today.

Simply put this is my favorite Mexican food spot in the entire Phoenix area. Nothing fancy just good simple Mexican good.  The salsa is great,  made perfect for their food. The tortillas are excellent and obviously made fresh daily. I've yet to try something I don't like here.  If you like tacos, burritos, quesadillas etc then this is your place.
