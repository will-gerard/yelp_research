My favorite place for nails!! I discovered it when I lived nearby and first impressed with Vivi! She was sweet and welcoming! The service and my nails were Amazing!! The next time I went in Vivi remembered my name and warmly welcomed me like an old friend! I have moved to nearly Deer Creek area and I drive out of my way to have my nails and waxing done there! I have to admit I have tried to go to other places closer to me but I Always regret it because I don't get that Family feeling there and the nails aren't nearly as well done as US Nails! I will continue driving out of my way for you ViVi!! Keep up the Amazing Service!!

Waldo and I checked out the park for the first time this morning! The park was in great shape with only a few large dogs in the designated area for large dogs. We had the small dog side to ourselves. It was a beautiful sunny day and there was some shade under a few small  trees. We will definitely spend more play time there!!

This is the closest location to my home but this is a Starbucks I Avoid!!! Having worked for Starbucks for many years in Washington state my addiction to good coffee runs deep and I am Very Familiar with how customers should be treated! This location is the Worst I have ever encountered and I vow never to support that location with any of my revenue. I went in for a pound of coffee and had it ground for a cone filter. Next morning opened the bag to find baby powder fine coffee. I went immediately to the store and asked to exchange it and have it ground again. The partner at the register was unhelpful and at first wanted a receipt but I stated I didn't have it plus I only wanted to get another pound not cash. She accommodated my request but with obvious unpleasant attitude. Next morning same baby fine powder to fine for my machine. I return again...trying to be pleasant I suggest that perhaps they need to recalibrate the grinder which can get off after time. The shift supervisor exchanged the coffee but Refused to Grind it because apparently I'm difficult to please!!! What!!!! When I managed a Starbucks I would have 1. Apologize for the inconvenience of coming in several times! 2. Grind a bit made sure it was correct with the customer then grind the pound. 3. Offered a cup of brewed coffee while they waited!! That was in the 90s when they really Trained Baristas now it seems sadly that Starbucks has lost it's Soul for Service. Very Sad example of that is at this location for sure!! Drive on to the Thunderbird location which is better.

Went for the first time with friends! Had wanted to dine there for months cause the patio area is so Adorable! The service was wonderful and friendly! Amy gave us great suggestions which were all delicious! We all shared our salads and main dishes because the portions are very generous! Great evening! We will be back! Stuffed mushrooms and calamari were appetizers that are pictured!

Went with several people to see the Secret life of Pets!! Very cute movie but the theater was a Mess!! Lots of staff wandering around aimlessly while stations were a Mess!! Watched one employee make a feeble attempt to sweep popcorn but his lack luster efforts only spread it around! I'm not loving the serve yourself goodie area either. You grab your goodies and stand in a long line with only 2 registers open (there are 6 registers)!!! What is the point of that??? Everyone around me was commenting on the stupidity of that thought process!! See the sad photos that show a theater that needs to rethink the way they are doing business?? Charging for popcorn toppings, nothing extra here...just a dirty theater. Harkins here I come.

Great atmosphere that is romantic! Service is warm and welcoming with a genuine desire to please! And please they Do!! My tastebuds were very pleased!! First the flatbread with Lobster- superb! I had the warm caprese salad and my fiancé the pork loin and shrimp! Everything was fresh, presented well and the flavors danced in my mouth!! Sharing pictures so you can Feast your eyes on the goodies that await you!! And yes...the shot glass desserts are the Bomb!!

We went for a little lunch after cleaning house to reward ourselves for our labor! I haven't been to this location and haven't been to Humble Pie in several years! We went in because I had fond memories of their Caprese Appetizer! I was happy to see it was still on the menu! Our server was very gracious and offered me samples of the 3 wines I was considering with my meal! My fiancé enjoyed the strawberry & Gorgonzola salad with a individual chicken pesto pizza! It was all very delicious and the patio was shady & quiet which made the meal even more enjoyable!!

Terrible!!! I was given this groupon coupon as a gift for my birthday in November!! Every time I try to schedule my appointment it seems like the ONE massage therapist they have to do the Dreaded Groupons isn't available!! Odd!! After several attempts I finally just said is this a Scam!!! Do you guys just never intend having availability!! I was treated poorly on every attempt to book- called again today and more of the same but this time the Extremely Rude receptionist stated that they are Losing Money with the Groupon and only have one massage therapist that is dedicated to doing them because they are New!! Fantastic excellent way to put a customer off!! Well done!! Tempted to contact Groupon and Better Business Bureau!! Companies like this need to be held accountable to poor behaviors!! I work in retail at the wealthiest company in the World dealing with devices and customers on a daily basis. We NEVER feel that each customer doesn't matter and the only priority is reaping massive profits without delivery amazing service!! I will perhaps someday get in for my Dreaded Appointment to really see this place (if it even exists)!!  Extremely disappointing experience and I haven't even been there! Great first Impression!!

UPDATE: This terribly operated business is doomed to FAIL!! I'm sure the only positive comments are either employees or friends that are trying to throw in 5 star ratings to try to counter the Numerous 1 star ratings (unfortunately negative ratings aren't possible)! After my comments were posted I received a call from The Receptionist (not the definition of a welcoming reception) who stated that I wasn't welcome at their Spa (yeah right) because of my Truthful less than glowing comments about my experience trying to even book my appointment! (Which was only happening because I was willing to Pay More to get in before the 5 week out date that was available because their New Less Experienced Therapist was only there limited days- and I wanted someone who knew what they were doing)!!! WOW!!! Then I see Beverly response this morning trying to sound like this Scam Outfit is trying to be workable or trying to Defend their Poor Business practices which include: Arguing with an unhappy client, interrupting and other shouting while I'm trying to calmly state that I would not Remove my comments which she was trying to BULLY me into doing!! And HANGING UP ON ME!! OMG really!! I've worked in retail and retail management, real estate, the title & escrow, cosmetics representative, and other professions of service and I have NEVER come across this level of Unethical Level of Business Practice!! Thank you for saving me from experiencing what I am sure would have been a poor massage!  (Most likely they run a matchbox car up and down your back and call it good)!!! I work with locals, tourists and hundreds of employees that I will be sure to warn about this Scam Outfit!! Maybe if you don't use a Dreaded Coupon or Groupon maybe you're treated differently but that shouldn't be the case! And poor Groupon for linking to them- it gives Groupon a bad impression if you're treated like a second class customer if you're redeeming a coupon.

We came in for a late night date night after working. My fiancé and I had only been in once before separately but neither of us really remembered the place! A co-worker recommended it as a great place and then I recalled being there for lunch years prior. First, we came in and the place was Happening! Live music, dancers, large groups grooving on the music & entertainment!! Our server was polite and courteous with great suggestions from the menu! Our drinks and food came quickly with attention to presentation as well! Amazing flavors! Fresh ingredients and a enjoyable evening! Thank you Otro! Job well done!!

This was my first time to Taco Guild and it won't be my last for sure! I have frequently stopped at the Starbucks in the same parking lot and the smells have always made me think I have to try that place out!! Well today was the day and I am just sorry it's taken me this long to enjoy the foodie delights that awaited me inside! My friend, her son & I went the Children's Museum and it was the perfect way to end the fun filled day! Carlos was are Amazingly attentive server and her guided us through the menu! We did the taco platters- we each had 3 different choices with the corn added! I had the beef, pork and Delish Duck!! It was like a Flavor Party in my mouth and all the tastebuds were digging the vibes for sure!! Desmond our little man had a quesadilla and he devoured half of it enjoying every bite! The margarita was perfect as well!! Well done Taco Guild!! Great atmosphere, food, drinks and service!! A+

What a wonderful experience! I was treated by my sweet fiancée for Christmas!! We went in for his Birthday because it was a couple massage! The place was clean, professional and very friendly! After trying to book at SpaMassage for you that has been nothing short of a Nightmare! I truly Appreciate their Integrity with their offers- no putting us off because of a Dreaded Offer or Groupon! Instead we were treated as valued clients and possible regulars! How Refreshing  Our room was enormous so there was plenty of room for the therapists to move about without feeling cramped! Music was soothing with no loud noises or voices to disrupt your relaxation!  We both had Amazing Massages that melted tensions and left us feeling at peace with the world! We have an Anniversary coming and we already plan on returning for another couples massage!! Again they are professional, clean and ethical! Not all places are....do you homework and look on Yelp to do your homework on reviews posted!! Great Job!! A+

I stumbled onto this gem through Yelp!! What a treasure! I have been driving into Scottsdale to another great establishment but I have recently moved towards Glendale area so it was getting to be too much time invested! After an appointment I thought I will check some reviews of local nails salons in the area-this one had great reviews (and yes I read them all)! And I looked at the photos (again very important)! Then to my pleasure it was just 15 minutes from me!! I had to investigate! I hit the Mother Load of choices in polish in gels, darling painting skills and wonderful friendly service!! I was offered a soda, shown a menu- which read like a cocktail menu!! Fantastic scrubs with complimenting lotions for a aromatherapy effect!!  My pedicure and manicure were both gels so a bit more but worth it for staying power! With tips included it was $110 but well worth it cause I left feeling like a Million!!! Excellent job! I will be back and will tell friends to check it out!! Your Welcome Yelpers!!

It's not often where everything comes together but it's been Achieved at JoyRide!! Great funky atmosphere, diversity in staff that dig what they do and a menu that gives your tastebuds reason to Party!! David was our Amazing and Entertaining Server! He steered us towards great choices like the Blood Orange Margarita! A trio of salsa as we devoured the salty crispy chips!! We all had the special for under $10 and we ate Like Queens!! Tacos all Fantastic with bold flavors and the salads were a delicious compliment!! Perhaps it was also my friends joining me that made the meal so FUN!! Thank you for the Enjoyment of Friendship and Food & Spirits JoyRide!! We will definitely be back!!

We have come here several times and we Never leave disappointed! The vibe is elegant yet casually zen with a fun factor with animation playing as a backdrop to the expansive bar! Some nights there is live music which is always enjoyable. The food is the Show Stopper with a fun flare mixing sweet with hot, tangy with zesty and a playful spin on the usually same old same old thai places!! The service is always quick and pleasant with suggestions off the menu! I'm always happy to have leftovers the next day!!  Thanks for the good times and we will see you soon!!
