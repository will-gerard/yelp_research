We pulled over to grab lunch here this weekend based solely on the appearance... It looked like it would be great! Their menu didn't seem that unique, but the girl who took our order was extremely friendly and offered some advice on her favorites, which included a pita and for both of us to get sides of the pasta salad. For 2 people to have lunch, I though $19 was a little steep, but we tried to stay optimistic as we found a place to sit. The environment was great- roomy, clean, bright, colorful. When our food was brought to us, my pita already was torn all the way down, so there was no way I was going to be able to manuever eating it with my hands. I probably should have said something, but instead just went up and asked for a fork and a knife.  Flavors were good, nothing special. Chicken was dry, and the pasta salad was nothing I would write home about.  We left full, somewhat pleased, but could have had the same experience for half the price.

Disappointed by the salsa they provided us with (tasted like ketchup mixed with chili sauce), but was pleasantly surprised by dinner: Baja tacos and my boyfriend got the shrimp fajitas which we both enjoyed! Staff was below average, but atmosphere, food, and prices were all excellent. Also had very very clean bathrooms! Would definitely come here again, just pass on the salsa and don't have expectations on the staff.

Great atmosphere to grab lunch with a friend. Plenty of seating outside, and a huge variety of funky sandwiches to try.  This is not your average place to grab a bite to eat--highly recommend!!

This place is funky, down to earth, and all about the music and having a good time... NOT about what you're wearing! I love the authenticity,  of this place, the age range, the diversity, and the common love for the jazz, blues and funk.  One of my favorite places in Phoenix! Get here early, seats are hard to come by after 10pm, especially on the weekend

I am new to the Phoenix area and when my parents flew in for a visit, I was desperately looking on Yelp for someplace close by to take them to for dinner. Boy were the reviews on this place right! We had a LOVELY dinner, were treated wonderfully by the staff, and 2 of us ordered that evening's special, were so impressed with the dish, the chef himself came out and talked to us, and gave us the recipe! (which we then tried to recreate that weekend at home) The lighting was a little dark, but didn't take away from the experience at all. Decorated with Western art, excellent staff, reasonable prices, great specials, and a good variety on the menu.

I feel so lucky to live so close to a large space so my dog can run around. I wouldn't say this is in a bad neighborhood, but I wouldn't say its in a great neighborhood either. If you keep a good eye on your dog and are a responsible pet owner, I don't see why you would have anything other than a blast here.  Plenty of parking, bags are usually provided for poop, and most of the owners are friendly enough.  I believe dog parks are places where the experience you have depends on what you put into it!

Being from the East coast, I was on the hunt for a honest, down to earth, NON-CHAIN garage to take a look at a car I had recently bought on Craigslist. After reading the raving reviews on Yelp, my boyfriend and I drove 40 min. to go to Gene's Autoworx, and after going, I would have driven over an hour.  He was honest, explained everything, was very fair, and all around was a wonderful experience. After working up 2 estimates (1 with brand name parts and the other with off the market parts), he printed them out and sent them home with us.  On our way out, my boyfriend wanted to make an appointment for his truck to be looked at, instead, Gene says "Oh, I'll take a look at it right now". 10 minutes later he had tightened this, tuned up that, and happily sent us on our way without charging us a dime for his additional time.  We will DEFINITELY be returning to Gene.

After watching Man vs Food, there was no way we were about to let another weekend go by without checking out this place! About a 5 minute drive from our place, we arrived around 7pm on a Friday night... it took us 10 minutes to find parking! That was our first indication it was going to be good! We were promptly seated in a cozy, nothing fancy table. Families to our left, couples to our right, Marc Anthony special blaring from the TVs, get the picture? This is one of the only places in Phoenix I've been to that doesn't serve alcohol, it didn't take away from the experience at all, but a good thing to know before going.  Our tortas were awesome awesome awesome! So reasonable, tasty, authentic.  Will be back again soon =)

This local pizza joint gets an A+ from me and my boyfriend. We are lucky enough to be neighbors with this place, and are impressed with it over and over again! We always order the Raffaele's special (which is a little steep at $20 for a large) but its always worth it.  A down to earth local pizza joint that is consistent, friendly, and oh so yummy!

Amazing, amazing, amazing.  I knew I would love it the second I walked in, because the entire atmosphere of this establishment screams: "my owners and employees take care of me and care a lot about quality!!!" The staff was friendly, and patient with me while I spent about 20 minutes deciding what to order for take out (everything, I mean EVERYTHING looked tasty!) While this place isn't "cheap", I didn't regret a single penny because the portion sizes were generous, and I knew that what I was putting into my mouth had been thoughtfully prepared and was healthy and filling.  I cannot rave about this place enough.. check it out!

Being lured by the opportunity of getting a decent haircut (and wash and blow dry!) for only $12, I took a chance and made an appointment. I was assigned to a girl, Tiffany who was graduating from her training in less than a month, so I felt comfortable immediately. I am not picky or high maintenance about my hair, and I felt like she wanted a lot of detail about EXACTLY how I wanted my hair cut, which I was having a hard time articulating. She was very friendly, very careful and attentive to detail, and checked in with me throughout the process so that there were no surprises and that we were on the same page (which I greatly appreciated.  I thought the service was great, especially for the price, but my only qualm with this experience was the time.... I had only a wash, very simple cut, and simple blow dry and I was there 2 hours and 15 minutes... yikes! For someone like me, who spends little time on their hair, it was agonizing to sit for that long... however I am in full support of helping students train at their art, so I understand.  I would go here again =)

Friendly, reasonably priced, incredibly professional staff. Will definitely be back! Also- lots of available appointment times, easy to find, and plenty of parking.

Needing a quick bite to eat, I thought I would try a new place in my very own neighborhood...big mistake! I ordered the chimichanga plate and the beef burrito plate... the rice and beans were good, and they were generous with the guacamole (only plus), but it is what was inside that disturbed me...  shredded beef, stringy onions, and canned tomatoes cooking on a stove in a pot for an entire day (maybe longer)... then shove that into both the beef burrito and the chimichanga...  I don't think so! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and great beans.. but I can get that at home from a can.  Pass on this one, trust me. sigh...

Needing a quick place to grab a bite after picking up my friend from the airport, we walked into "That's a Wrap" where the owner warmly greeted us. I was immediately impressed by the atmosphere, (seat cushions, tasteful music not too loud, and funky menus). It took us both a while to decide on what to order b/c everything looked so good! I got the Ken and Barbie-Que, and my friend ordered Alota Fajita. We were both blown away! I loved that the sides with the sandwiches were something other than bagged chips you picked out- fresh chips and salsa, pasta salad, soup, or fruit sala.  Highly recommend this place!

We tried 2 of the spring rolls and then each got the Beef Pho- we loved it! From the ambiance, to the crowd, to the friendly owners who frequently (but not obnoxiously) checked in on us throughout the meal- this place was awesome. We are always looking for new, fun independent places to grab a bite, and this is a new favorite of ours. We would take friends from out of town here in a heart beat- which speaks volumes! While their prices weren't cheap, I believe the quality of the food was well worth it. Looking forward to going back!
