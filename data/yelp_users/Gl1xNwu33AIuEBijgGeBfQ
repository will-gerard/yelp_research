This store has a rude and miserable staff.  I was just in with my mother to buy Thanksgiving dishes.  We come to this store all of the time, and never get a "hello" or smile.   We gather the dishes we want to purchase for a total of $35 dollars and pull out a $100 bill.  The cashier, an elderly woman, refused to open the register and take the money.  She then said: "I have to ask the manager if I can make change."  Really?  That's how they run a business?  As we waited, hey woman came up and asked if she could put a large train set on the counter while she shopped around the rest of the store. The same cashier said in a nasty tone, "Well we have baskets. Use that."  She was very rude to the customer. You would think with all of the online shopping options nowadays, the staff would have some common courtesy for the people that want to spend money at the store.  They ruined our shopping day.  I hope the management and owner see this review and clean house.  We will stick to the Secret Village from now on, where the customer service is wonderful.

Delicious fresh Greek chicken pita at a cozy busy cafe in the Kierland area.  My boyfriend loves his hot chicken pesto sandwich.  Good food and good ambience.

Last night I stopped in around 8:00 p.m. to pick up food to go.  I am new to the area, and thought I could grab a quick healthy dinner to bring home after a very long day of work.  I arrived and was not greeted by a hostess.  I went to the bar and watched the bartender cleaning.  I was ignored, and asked if I could see a menu.  I again was not greeted, but a menu was placed in front of me.  I ordered the chicken avocado salad and the cauliflower, and waited about 20 minutes for the food to arrive.  When the food arrived, the bartender said, "We were out of avocado, so the kitchen just doubled  your chicken order.  If you want I can take it back and add a vegetable, but you'll have to wait longer."  Tired, starving, irritated at the rude staff for not even bothering to ask me if that is what I wanted, I said "forget it" and took the order home.  I subsequently called the manager to explain how I was treated, and she put me on hold and said she had to "verify with her kitchen that this actually happened."  So I again waited at about 9:00 p.m. while the manager questioned everything I was saying, as opposed to taking my number and calling me back the next day.  The food?  Meh.  It was a $14 salad with chicken, soggy lettuce and bacon bits I could have purchased for half the price somewhere else.  The quality was definitely lacking.  The cauliflower was good, but not worth the $12 price tag by any means.  I would have gone back if I was treated as a valued customer, however this place obviously does not care about keeping business around.   This was definitely not what I expected from the Herb Box.

I rented a home and showed up to move in it today.  I was told it was cleaned earlier in the week.  I walked in the house and it was absolutely filthy from the last tenant - and I needed it cleaned fast.  I called this company and they had four wonderful gals show up and clean my new house within an hour of a half.  They also arrived on time on short notice.  They got the dust off of the floor boards and outlets, window sills, cleaned all inside and outside windows, washed off the porch walls and got rid of the disgusting cigarette ashes, sanitized the bathroom and got the dirty tub sparkling white  (which I could not even look at it was so gross before they got there), cleaned the wood floors, and much more.  Thank you so much ladies.  You made my life so much easier today.  In my opinion, worth every penny.  I cannot believe this company accommodated me so quickly and easily, and sent four women out.   Last but not least, the receptionist who took my call and moved this so quickly today was so sweet and professional.  Great employees, great service  Thank you!!!!

Today I went into the Secret Village toy store to buy my two year old niece a birthday present.  My mom told me about this store and raves about the selection.   I was not disappointed.  The selection was amazing and Anthony, the employee running the store, was delightful, fun, kind and helpful.  What a great find!  The presents were a hit and I will definitely be back!

I ordered the chicken salad and there was almost no chicken on it.  Less than a strip.  I paid $12 for a cup of soup, a bowl of lettuce, and a drink.  When I asked the manager why he said "company policy".

I scheduled an electric appointment with Tony at 2 PM. I even called at 1 PM to make sure that he would show up. He said yes I'll see you around 2 or 2:10 today.  I took off work, and he never showed up and never answered my multiple phone calls.

Alex wanted to come out to my home at eight am on Sunday to install a plug for my BMW i3.  After making arrangements with him, he never showed up.  I called multiple times and sent text messages.  He did not respond to my calls or texts.  Very unprofessional and rude.
