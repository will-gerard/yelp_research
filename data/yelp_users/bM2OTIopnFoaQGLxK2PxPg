The following is a few reasons why I dig Sky Harbor Airport.   -Security moves pretty quickly. -There are quite a few restaurant options.  -Everything is carpeted and very clean.  - They have free transportation that will take you from one terminal to another.  -Clean restrooms -Free Wifi  - It might just be a Phoenix thing, but even the TSA agents were hot.  I'm sure there are some cons as well, but all in all my experiences have always been pleasant flying in or out of here.

I am not a fan of all the pretentious BS of being on a VIP list or doing bottle service so whenever I come to Vegas I like to visit the Carnival Court Bar because its where the real people hang out. The bartenders do flair which gets a bit annoying because they blow a damn whislte every two seconds but the prices are reasonable and theres a convienice store right around the corner you can just buy whatever at and bring it in for cheap. Everytime I have been there there was a cover band that took requests which is always cool as long as they do a good job which they have everytime I've been there.

It's one thing to charge a $12 minimum for a ride less than a half a mile away. It's another thing to inform someone of this after you've arrived at the destination. On top of that this guy didn't even have any change. What a scheister!

I'd say a 3 and 1/2  It's definitely not a hotel that a bunch of your buddies can crash on the floor of. Well... they can, but it won't be very comfortable due to the fact that they're all hard wood. Be prepared if you do have visitors because they're certain to invade the extremely comfy beds by comparison.   The rest of the room is ok I guess.  Even though the suite didn't exactly dazzle me as a whole it's bathroom was much more spacious than the normal units. I don't think I'd justify paying for an upgrade because they are pretty much the same though.   The staff of the place was altogether was pleasant and always answered questions with a smile. The gym, although tiny, had new equipment and enabled me to get a decent work out in even though doing so from hotels is usually pretty difficult.   One last weird thing I noticed was a strange swishing sound in the room that happened every couple of hours. I'm not exactly sure what it was, but I think it may have had something to do with it being a green hotel. Gotta love saving the planet so even though it woke me up I gotta give it an extra half star.

Sign me up for a return visit based on the eye candy alone. Every server here was a total smoke show! The amount of times I fell in love was the equivalent to the number of sake bombs I consumed (4) making my evening both easy on the eyes and buzzworthy.   Even though I showed up late to meet my coworkers and the food was not exactly fresh, it was certainly apparent that for Scottsdale sushi this is a hot spot. Several of the rolls I tried were unique with innovative flavor combinations.   For dessert we headed into the private karaoke rooms where I ordered a large humiliation sundae. My only caution is to be prepared for the most random song selection you've ever seen. With very minimal hip hop or 80's tunes and a heavy dose of Celine Dion, just be prepared to double my intake of bombs in order to be comfortable singing here.

Man I wish there was a business in SD like this. I do a lot of late night eating in my town, and there's only a few choices for somewhat healthy eats after hours so I was thrilled to see that this sandwich shop was not only open till 3am, but they also deliver.   It came quick, it was pretty darn tasty, and I didn't wake up with my digestive track saying "F*** You A**hole!" A foot long turkey with avocado to my hotel room for under $10 at 2am?!?! Can I get a hell ya?
