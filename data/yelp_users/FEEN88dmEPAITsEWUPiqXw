The grass is in great shape on and off the fairway allowing for stray shots to lay on a playable surface.

My wife and I love the nachos, they are not your typical nacho plate. Great appetizer for 2-3 people.

I was unable to get a haircut because I didn't want to give them my phone number! I asked if I could just give my name? The answer, no we track you by your phone number. So I walked out. Weird business practice. There are so many places to get a quick low cost haircut to choose from. This one is not it.
