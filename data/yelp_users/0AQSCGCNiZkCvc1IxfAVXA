The food was what got this place up to two stars. It was pretty tasty if you are willing to spend half your day on breakfast. This is probably the most poorly managed restaurant I have been to in years. Put your name down and go have breakfast somewhere else. By the time your name is called it should be time for lunch. After years in the industry restaurants are all about the experience and less about the food. The food was good here for the most part aside from the hash browns. For a larger sized restaurant serving breakfast food I do not understand how on earth anyone would have to wait any longer than 40 minutes, but this seems standard to Snooze. I guess if you have a half a day to spend and your bored it's a great place for people watching and you will get to eat eventually. I won't be back again.

Worst experience ever!!! Paid $105.48 for a family 4 pack online. Arrived at the event to get the tickets we paid for and we were told they were all sold out. The event coordinator confirmed we would be refunded the full amount. I was never refunded. After calling, emailing, disputing with my bank, and blowing up social media I have decided to never participate in any of these events and may just never eat at a food truck again. These people will rob you!
