This is the absolute worse place to live.   I have never experienced such unprofessional management and a staff that is so behind on their work.  I could only handle living at this place for four months before I decided to move out.  I had mold in my apartment that no one would come fix for a month and a half,  and it took me to hire an outside inspection company to test the mold, before they eventually did anything about it.   That was only one of the many issues I had living at this residence, it is filled with druggies and I was even robbed at gun point and the office never even once tried to talk to me about the incident... I would never recommend living here to anyone.
