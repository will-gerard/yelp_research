Had to take my vehicle in for potential front and rear brake replacement. So rather than sell my soul to the devil aka dealership I recalled my past good experiences with National Automotive and gave them a call. I received a general approximate price quote and made my appointment.  Showed up to drop my car off and was greeted by Jake who took my info and I then inquired about a ride to work just a few miles north. Not a problem.  Long story longer I was planning on stoping at least $500 which I was not expecting but ok it is what it is then I get a call from Jake, to share my brakes were more than fine. Jake shared he had the tech do a thorough inspection to make sure nothing else was wrong and thank goodness all was in good shape.  I felt bad that they did all this inspecting and I had no bill. I said Jake I know I need my oil changed and I think spark plugs replaced at 30k mikes Check that out... I wanna give you boys something.  Every opportunity where Jake could of nailed me to replacing things I didn't need to Jake passed with flying colors!  I was highly recommended to National Automotive from a mechanic friend and praised Randy the owner and his team for such high business ethics and honesty. Well today my friends I do not doubt nor will I ever doubt what Jake, Randy or anyone of the guys recommends because I seen it before my eyes! Taking my money is like stealing candy from a  baby when it comes to car repair, I am helpless!  Thank you Jake and National Automotive Repair! I'll be back!
