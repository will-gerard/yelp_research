The bartender's rock!! Thanks Will!! Their website SUCKS!!! Can you say, "FALSE ADVERTISING"? I thought you could. Their website states, "Ask your server for a free taxi." What they REALLY mean to say is..."if you drive your own vehicle to the bar, they will give you a ride back to your car in the morning for "FREE"....which is standard policy with Discount Cab at ALL bars.....you still have to pay for the taxi cab ride home. If you're going to abide by their policy, you should just use The Drunk Driver's. Their service is much more cost effect than The Monastery's "free taxi" service. DO NOT GO TO THE MONASTERY WITH THE INTENT OF BEING RESPONSIBLE AND USING THEIR "FREE" TAXI SERVICE.  What a joke!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you want healthy food that's delicious, this is the place to go. The menu is full of choices! There's a color key on the menu that indicates which menu items are safe for those with different food intolerance's. Where else can you go that they would put that information on the menu?   Kirstin, the owner, is awesome! She very knowledgeable about food intolerance's and nutrition. She is typically available to answer any questions.   We attended the "Dinner with a Doc" food allergy seminar, and it was very informative. If you get the chance, check the calendar for upcoming events. They're definitely worth the time and money!!   I will definitely be back as often as possible!!

The Shroomie and the Habanero Chicken salad are delicious. Can't wait for the microbrews. I definitely recommend this place for great burgers and salads. Delish!!

Pros: Nice patio, great tasting drink (Orange Bliss), quickly seated  Cons: Slow service, glass full of ice with very little liquid, long wait for food, rude bartender/bad waitstaff  Stick to Blue 32 even if there's a wait. There are way too many options near this place to waste your time & money.

I was hopeful that this would be a great option for a quick, efficient car wash, since it's close to work. No such luck...as previously stated by many other patrons, the dryers here are terrible. I would hardly call it a dryer. Luckily I had a towel in my car, otherwise this car wash would have been a waste. There are so many better options out there...and for only $2 more to boot. I won't be back.
