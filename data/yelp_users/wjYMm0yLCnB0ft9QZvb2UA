I have used Fresh Cut Romance in the past and haven't ever had a problem with them...until last week.  I was out of town and tried ordering a bouquet for a friend who is losing her mother.  I ordered very early in the morning on Thursday and then received a message much later in the day saying there would be a $40 delivery charge to deliver to Gilbert.  I wasn't excited about the charge but at that point just wanted to have them delivered that day and didn't have time to order something else that would be delivered in time so I said okay only to then be told oh never mind, we can't deliver to that zip code.  I was asking them to be delivered to Gilbert...not central phoenix albeit but still not super far away.  If they don't deliver to this zip code there should probably be a list of zip codes they do deliver to or perhaps their staff should be aware of this when they call saying there would be a $40 charge to deliver.  Then, I find out the next day that they also called the girl I was trying to send the flowers to because they wanted to let her know I had ordered her flowers but that they were not going to deliver them because it was too far.  In my opinion, most of the fun of getting flowers is the surprise.  This was a very poor business decision and completely deflated my intention of doing something to put a smile on my friends face.  I will not use Fresh Cut Romance in the future.

I have used Top Notch Transportation a few times to provide transportation for clients when they are in town.  I have been nothing but impressed with their services.  They are always very easy to work with, professional and prompt.  I have even had pickups scheduled as early as 4 a.m., which they did without a complaint.  They are great and I would highly recommend them for any transportation needs!
