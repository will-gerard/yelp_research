I attended a concert at Celebrity Last night.....the process to get in was orderly, and friendly security staff. The bartender was also very cordial and engaging.    Now - while I doubt that there will be a response, here's a warning to everyone purchasing tickets. If you happen to select the B8,B9, or B10 sections, make sure you DO NOT pick the bottom three rows.  That's because they use this area for EVERYONE who seems to want to sit in a folding chair, behind the lower tier.  I can understand the handicapped, and a companion for that person.  I can't understand the rather healthy man and his equally healthy (although rather large) friend who grabbed chairs and blocked off the view for those in the bottom row.  And, the staff who kind of blew off the lady who asked about it.  In those seats, which are not cheap, you now are blocked from seeing the front of the stage.    It was a disappointment - guess it's a great lesson, although for the show, a rather expensive one.

I saw a post about how the service goes down when they are busy.....and I agree! Ordered online, it was about 10 minutes overdue (change the pick up time!), and then the fried rice had lumps of rice......just not worth the price.  And, rude counter help doesn't help at all.....

Have been going to concerts at Marquee Theatre for the last few years and the latest improvements are great.  The VIP Balcony gives you a way to watch the show, have a drink (and the prices are just about the same, or less, than other music venues like this) and now, there are bar stools for sitting up there (if you get there early enough!).  There may be times to be down on the floor as the sound is not as great up there as it is in the main area, and waiting it's a little on the chilly side (however, when the place is full, that's okay!).  The only negative is the noise level in the VIP Bar area....if there is a group who are not there for the music (and are carrying on conversations behind you), however, that could happen anywhere.  And, I heard some complain about only 2 restrooms.....uh, I guess you could go downstairs if you really needed to, and hope there is no line there, or just enjoy the music while standing in line.....  The show has to be sold out, or close, for them to offer the VIP Balcony, so there is a need to watch and upgrade to the higher price ($10-$20 upcharge, depending on the artist), but other than that, it's a great improvement.   You can usually get parking in their lot or across the street for $7 - not much different than other venues, other than maybe out at AkChin.    Prices for shows - all over the board, depending on the draw of the artist. Have seen unknowns to Green Day there, with prices accordingly.......

Great restaurant, great food and service.  Always treated extremely well, good suggestions on menu items.  Close by favorite.for me.  And, they have great specials during the summer to get you in there on the weekend....have to love that part.   I have never had a bad meal there, the service has been great and if you ask the server for a recommendation, you get some good ones!

Went to Eddie's House last Saturday evening.  After we were seated, the manager came over to take our drink order.  He made some suggestions on the wine, and the one he suggested turned out to be excellent in both flavor and price!!    Our waiter was excellent, he made suggestions, and discussed our options with ordering.  We wanted to try an appetizer and then have an entree....and half orders worked just fine!  The seafood pot stickers were wonderful, the sauce is rich, so sharing was perfect.  I had the bacon infused meatloaf and my friend had the Seared Diver scallops.  Both were flavorful and cooked perfectly.    The waiter even bought us dessert, which we split, although we each could have had our own.......the Heath Bar, Chocolate Chip Cookie Tiramisu was also great.    We'll go back.....my only complaint is the tables could be a little farther apart, I didn't really enjoy hearing the "first date" conversation at the next table, however, I'll concede I have really, really good hearing!

I found Angela about a year and a half ago from a Groupon deal.  The shop is kind of out of the way (Shea, right by the 51 freeway), and in an unpretentious little shopping mall.  I have hair that is not the easiest to work with and Angela did a great job!!  She listened to me and I came out with a haircut that I love!  I have been going back to her since then, and I always get great comments from others about my hair cut.  Her prices are very good for the service and skill you get from her.  I carry her cards with me in case anyone asks me who cuts my hair.  I'll be a happy customer as long as she is there!

I bought a massage certificate a few months ago for Tranquil Massage.  I was kind of wondering what I would get for such a great deal.....and it was wonderful!   Megan took the time to ask me about what areas were going to need the most work (I spend ALL day on a computer, so the neck and shoulders take the brunt of the punishment), and how long I wanted her to spend working out those kinks.  She took care of them, plus the lower back, areas that needed it too!   This is what Megan loves doing and she has a great natural talent I think.  Will be back to see her again, that's for sure!!

Have gone to two concerts there......one with some seating, one with "VIP" seating that was equal to the cost of the tickets, and only a few seats would have kind of been marginally worth it. There is no reason they can't have some high top tables (like at the first one) even if it's toward the back.  Not everyone needs to be at the very front, and give some options please.     Price of drinks okay......$4 water though, really?   On a good note, the acoustics are good, and it has the potential to be a good venue to see live music.    Depending on group, will be back.....

I have taken my car in there for the last couple of years.  They have stood by what they do.  I've had a problem that they have worked at resolving, and will continue to work with me until it is taken care of.  Great service, good prices, and all around nice group of people there.  Would recommend to anyone who is in the East Valley - worth the drive to me!
