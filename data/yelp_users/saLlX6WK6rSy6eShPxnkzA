I used to work right around the corner from this place and really enjoyed it!  The Bad: The parking DOES suck around noonish, but lets be honest, how many places in the Central Phoenix area have ideal parking? It's definitely better than downtown Phoenix....parking wise that is.   I love the "Bird is the Word", "Gringo Starr", "Rocky VII", and the chips and salsa and pasta salad sides. Also, the jasmine iced tea is really good. Honestly, this place is one of the coolest lunch places around Central Phoenix!

After recently visiting La Grande Orange in Phoenix, La Bocca in Tempe, and The Parlor in Phoenix, I can honestly say I have had much better pizza than Red Devil.   Four of us came here last week for a birthday dinner, and I honestly just wasn't impressed. We ordered the Italian Special and the Greekfest, and both were overloaded with toppings and falling apart, and overall not too flavorful. Olives were everywhere, and if you are only a partial olive fan, it isn't too great.   Plus side- the service was very good and I had a cup of the soup that was decent.  overall probably wouldn't come back.

Sooo....I have been going to Hanratty's since I was a wee young un....almost 10 years now.   FACTS: It's a dive bar. Bottom line. You're not going to get good food service or high end beers. But you won't find a cheaper draft beer, game of pool, or round of darts. Furthermore, the staff are the friendliest I have ever encountered. I am proud to call some of them my friends, and ALL of them know my name when I walk in.   Disclaimer: I probably go there perhaps once a month, so I am definitely not a "slouched over the bar every afternoon" regular, although those are plentiful and all very entertaining at Hanrattys.   I love this place. As a bartender for 10 years, I have been hard pressed to find a quintessential "Cheers like" bar, and Hanratty's is certainly it. Everyone knows your name, whether you like it or not!

Last weekend we went to Wrigley Mansion for the fabulous Sunday champagne brunch and it certainly did not disappoint! This was my 4th trip to the Mansion for special occasions, and I was sad to see how empty it was compared to the previous times I had been before! We had a 1PM reservation and by 2:30 we were pretty much the last table in the place.  However, the servers were wonderfully friendly and helpful and the food stayed replenished the entire time, which I appreciated greatly since it was such a quiet day.  The best parts of the brunch are the endless champagne/mimosas and the variety of the buffett, especially the seafood and omelet stations. Last year we decided to try a different brunch spot and it was not even close to Wrigley. Plus, it is so reasonably priced! (around $40 a person)   So in summation, if you are looking for a great brunch with killer views, look no further.

Carolina's has the best tortillas in town, hands down.  I'm going to pretend like I didn't read some of the reviews about the place being in the "ghetto" and not wanting to be there after dark, etc. My office is just across the street, and while I will admit that the neighborhood is different than the one I live in, I've never felt nervous about being there. Most of the residents of the neighborhood whom I have met and worked with are hardworking individuals just trying to make ends meet. Ok that's the end of my soapbox tirade.   Moving on, we eat at Carolina's quite often since there aren't a whole lot of other options within walking distance and I'll be damned if I give up my covered parking space in the summer! I actually like the "cafeteria" type style of the place, and will occasionally eat there instead of ordering food to go.   I love the Machaca burritos, and the breakfast burritos are to die for (and at $3 a pop, you can't beat it)   Bottom line, I highly recommend checking out Carolina's for some good Mexican food!

I went to Teakwoods this evening with my parents (who live down the street and LOVE this place). We had spent the day at the pool and didn't want to cook, and Teakwoods is the perfect place to pop in and not worry that you're wearing a bathing suit and no makeup.   I really like the atmosphere of this place- it's very versatile. I came here while attending ASU and it was a great place for beer and wings on the cheap. But its also a great place for a casual dinner and they have pretty damn good food for a bar with peanuts on the ground.   I had the Chicken Jack sandwich, which I always get, and it was good. The sweet potato fries I had with it very overwhelmingly spicy, which I didn't like, but I'm sure some people do. Both my parents had burgers and liked them as well. We also had bloody mary's, since they are on special on Sundays. They were fine, but nothing spectacular. I should have stuck to beer in a place like Teakwoods.

Being a West Valley girl, I was a bit excited about venturing to Gilbert to try something new. Liberty Market was pretty much awesome. After hearing it compared to La Grande Orange in Central Phoenix, I was intrigued. LGO is one of my favorite places to have a meeting or lunch with clients.....  I can say that I liked Liberty Market even better! I had the White Pizza, as did one of my dinner companions, and it was very good AND reasonably priced. My other friend had the Far East salad with Chicken. All of us were very satisfied with our choices.   It was not too crowded, but also was a Tuesday night around 6PM, so based on previous Yelpers statements I can see how it would be loud if it were crowded. I would definitely come back here! Too bad I live 40 miles away. But a girl can dream.....

I had pretty high expectations for this place, and they blew any expectations I had out of the water!  My H and I stayed at The Camelback Inn the weekend after Thanksgiving (one can only sleep so many nights in your parent's guest room!) and were hoping for a cool place to crash. What we got was an awesome getaway! We barely left the resort!   The service was impeccable. From the moment we checked in and received our free gifts for being Marriott Rewards members, I knew that this was going to be a great trip. The bar and restaurant (both of which I reviewed separately) made the experience even better. My H and dad went golfing and said the course was great.   The Sunday champagne brunch was one of the best I'd been too. Free flowing champagne, crab legs, shrimp, and everything else you can imagine.   In summation I would highly recommend staying here- the location was great too, not too far out in the boonies like some of the nicer places in AZ. 5 stars!

This is a great place to meet up with friends and just chill out, especially in nicer weather! The staff is always friendly, and the outside patio is awesome to watch people and also check out Central Avenue- which always holds some fun entertainment!

Well, I suppose I will be echoing the majority of Yelpers on here when I say that I really love Fez and in my approximately dozen times eating lunch, dinner, or happy hour there, have not had a bad experience.   Last night three of us headed to Fez after a day by the pool. It was around 8PM and the place was still hopping. We were seated quickly and our server was very prompt and friendly.   We started with the hummus as always- which is one of my favorite appetizers, along with the lettuce wraps. (In fact, my mom only orders lettuce wraps when we come here)   I had the Rosemary chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries, and it was delicious as well. I think Fez probably has the best sweet potato fries in town.   Overall, I think Fez is a great example of how downtown Phoenix could be.

I love Penzey's. I've had great experiences with both their online and in store service. The only thing that would make them better is if they had stores in New Mexico! Instead I have to get my fix when I'm in AZ visiting family.

As I was reading the rest of the reviews of Feeney's prior to lodging my own, I realized that I have never been there for the dinner hour! So I can't comment on the lights, candles, and ambience aforementioned.  As Arik mentionined, Crystal is one of the best bartenders I have ever met! She has the best combination of customer service and sassiness that many of us bar regulars love. I've been to Feeney's a few times for drinks, and always had a great experience. They have a really cool patio for smokers as well.   I think the thing I love about this place is that there are so many regular fixtures, presumably from the neighborhood. The times I have been there have been the early happy hour times, and it feels like a neighborhood bar, except the median age of patrons is closer to my parents age than mine. But not in a creepy way.   I have had lunch there once, a few months ago, and it was very fine (3 stars). I had a club sandwich, my other 3 companions had sandwiches as well, and we were all satisfied.   The 4 stars comes from the bar, its patrons, and the bartenders.

You can't get any better than Fair Trade in my book. And here's why:  I work for a grassroots non profit organization. This will be important later in the story.   I first discovered Fair Trade through one of the owners, who also happens to volunteer for the organization I work for. (Remember I said my job would be important to the story?) I came in a few times and was continually impressed with the friendly staff, great coffee, and overall great atmosphere.   Because of my job (and lack of office space) I have a LOT of coffee meetings. Sometimes it's all I ever do. And FTC is a great location, and it's way cooler than Starbucks. So my coworkers and I definitely give them a ton of business with our meetings!   The Sunday brunch is awesome, everyone must try the egg puff and the potatoes, they are to die for. It's a great way to spend a Sunday morning!  The free WiFi is also awesome when I need a Central location to work. Sometimes I refer to it as my office.   Lastly, Fair Trade donated coffee to the annual fundraising event that our organization holds annually. It's just a wonderful testament to how community oriented the staff and owners are, and how great Fair Trade is for downtown Phoenix!

I gotta say, as a single gal who works 60 plus hours a week and loathes fast food, Fresh and Easy is my answer.   I will agree with other Yelpers that some of the prices are strange, but there are a few things that have unbeatable prices. Beer is one of them, especially for domestic beers. (Yes, I know they taste like water. But I love them nonetheless.) Also, I can usually find great prices on eggs, sweet potatoes, hummus, and canned things like tomato paste.   The other fun thing is their version of the "bargain bin". Because F&E has a lot of fresh ready made meals and meats, they have a relatively short shelf life. So they will mark many things down 50% on the day they expire. Of course you have to use them in a timely manner once you purchase them, but you can't beat a fresh ahi tuna steak for $3.50!   Overall, I'm a big fan of Fresh and Easy.

Living in the West Valley, I like to choose places to meet up with friends that are convenient for all of us, and Westgate is helpful for that because of it's proximity to the 10 and the 101- and the stadium is pretty hard to miss!  Anyway, I love Yard House for drinks on the patio. I've been there for dinner half a dozen times and it's great food as well. Their happy hour is really great for food and drinks, which is hard to find at Westgate sometimes! I love their crab cakes and nachos, as well as the great beer selection and prices!

We recently stayed at the Tropicana for one night and like all places I review, they always start out with 5 stars. However, there were 3 separate experiences that happened that, had only of them happened I might have overlooked it. However, three times is the charm, or the kiss of death as the case may be.  Contrary to what I read on Yelp, check in was a breeze. We arrived around 1pm and were checked in in under 10 minutes. Because we didn't think we could check in until 3, we had left our bags with the valet folks to be brought to the room later, since we were meeting up with people for lunch.   We arrived back to the hotel around 7pm, and had 8pm dinner reservations, so we rushed up to the room to change clothes. However, our bags were not in the room. We called downstairs and they said they were coming up "momentarily". 30 minutes later we called and were told the same thing. An hour later (so it's now 8pm, when we were supposed to be at dinner) my husband called down and was very upset and demanded to know where the bags were. Just 1 minute later, they arrived at the door. So not sure what the issue was, but it definitely felt like they were either being dishonest or ignoring our requests.   The next morning we went downstairs to meet friends for breakfast and the elevator was broken. We were told by the manager that it would be up and running in "just a moment". No big deal, we were on the 3rd floor so we hopped down the stairs. However, after breakfast (which I will talk about in just a moment) I headed upstairs to pack the bags and bring them downstairs while my husband was finishing playing the slots downstairs (I lost money faster than him!) I didn't even consider that the elevators still wouldn't be working, but they weren't so I had to drag two bags down the stairs. Not one of my finer moments. Again, if the manager had told us it might be awhile, I would have had my husband come with me to get the bags.   Lastly, we went to the Beach Cafe for breakfast. The service was really slow and inefficient. Everyone was perfectly nice, but they were either short staffed or not trained well, not sure which. It took nearly an hour to get our food (group of 6, all ordered egg-type dishes so nothing complicated). I ordered a Bloody Mary and never received it and when I asked about it when she brought the food she said she forgot. I told her never mind. We also watched two couples be seated and tables around us and get up to leave since they never got waited on.  All in all, I don't think I would stay here again. We gave it a shot because we are Hilton Honors members and this property was supposedly newly remodeled and taken over by Hilton. I really hope that they are able to work out the kinks in management and training to get this hotel where it needs to be.

After returning to NM from a weekend at the Camelback Inn, I am missing it already!   This bar was awesome- a huge open outdoor space with live music and immpeccable service. The first night we had some of their great happy hour- $4 maragaritas and queso fundido. Then the next day we came back and had some more great apps- all under $6! The filet mignon sliders and the guacamole were the favorite of our group of 4.   When we first arrived at The Camelback Inn we were considering going out for drinks/dinner and we ended up staying right where we were- why leave?

Have you ever had a vision of how you think something will be, and the reality isn't what you thought it would be? Well, I think that may have been a bit of my problem with The Parlor. After reading the reviews of this place on here (and I trust y'all!) I was very excited to visit the Parlor for my birthday dinner Thursday.   Sooo...  The good: the pizzas were amazing! We had the Yukon Gold and the seafood pizza and both were delicious. Maybe not as great as Pizzeria Bianco, but we also didn't have to wait 3 hours. We sat on the patio (yes, in July! it wasn't bad at all). Also, as some previous reviews have mentioned, they have PBR on draft....which made me giggle.   The "meh" (I won't say anything was bad about this place, but just meh) The service was pretty slow, and the server not super friendly. She wasn't rude, but just sorta lackadaisical. The appetizer (meat and cheese plate) was really small for 4 people (and we asked if it would be enough) Seriously, we each got one piece of prosciutto, one square of pita, and some cheese. We also had the ginger martini, which the server recommended, and it was basically a shot in a martini glass for $11.   Overall, I would go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice. However, it is a great addition to the downtown Phoenix/Biltmore circuit, and I definitely would have their pizza again!
