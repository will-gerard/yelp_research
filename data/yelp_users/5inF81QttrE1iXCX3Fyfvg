Everyone told me the Rio was outdated. They are crazy! We had a straight pimped out room with king bed. The next day the convention was easy as pie to get around and the staff were very helpful. I really enjoyed my stay here. :)

If you are looking for a reason to hate Vegas go here. Not only were the bartenders slow, but the drinks were slower and tiny in size. The music was all horrible rap (not that I don't like rap, I listen often to it and this just was poorly chosen tunes) The gogo dancers were disgusted with the music as well. One proven way to tell if the music sucks is to just watch the dancers. It sucked! I've never become so tired so fast in Vegas. Maybe it's just the sign of the times.

It really annoys me when people complain about the service of a restaurant. Maybe because people expect perfection on a busy night. I rather think of it as my company sucked if I was too conscientious of wondering were my food was. My experience here was on a Monday and it was almost full. The host went way out of his way for us. The food came out fast. The drinks were delicious. Most importantly the food was very very good! I highly recommend this place!

Great place to come if you are a sports fan or like big women which I'm not a fan of. One waitress was sweating. I had to check my phone for latest cpr techniques just in case she coded.

My girlfriend and I attended Pomo's last month and we were extremely happy with the service and the food.   We were really shocked on how fast the service is!  I read the reviews on here and can understand some negative ones but those people are idiots for what you get. This isn't a $50 a plate restaurant! So those people who are looking for perfection from a very affordable restaurant are "smoking" stuff!   My girl had the pizza which was really good, and I had the lasagna which was above average. I did love the complementary lemoncello shot, and the dessert.  The only negative was that the young waitress (very good-looking so I will overlook) brought out our plates one at a time and said some lame excuse that she didn't know we wanted them together. What? So we are going to eat separately? Obviously, there was a mixup but I'm prone to those so I'm not going to hold it over her because she was young and easy on the eyes. :)
