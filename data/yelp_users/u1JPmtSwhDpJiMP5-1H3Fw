I don't like Panda Express usually. But this place is so good. The food is cooked so well and everything is hot and delicious ..  The people who work here give very generous portions and don't try to skim you.  Customer service is standard here just polite and move you along. Not a bad thing since I'm not a very chatty person. I'm always in a rush to get from place to place .   Great food. Fresh food and a clean area to sit and eat

Love this nordstrom rack. It's obviously higher end and provides great brands for both men and women. Abundance of shoe sizes except for fives which is what I am. No surprise there.. Good designer items  Tom ford Burberry  Prada Yves saint Laurent Salvatore ferragamo  Donna Karen Trues Sevens  Rock and republic Chanel Marc Jacobs  Etc etc  It's an abundance of clothes. I love fabric and prints. When I'm in here I feel like I'm hunting for my next treasure.  Found a semi designer shirt here for 1 dollar. Can't beat that. And of course a bunch of other amazing items at a discounted price. Scottsdale az doesn't have much eclectic features but it sure does carry luxury and designer like it's the newer fashion capital.

I am from California and I live there. I expect some good work for my nails being done especially when I leave a place and the price is half of what they charge. I do visit and frequent this area so I do sometimes run into the occasional need to go to the shops here. Which I will now avoid since they're overly expensive and do a shitty gel manicure.  They did my toes and nails and took me for a fool. No use of cuticle softener to clean off my feet, nor use of cuticle softener to clean off my hands. Uh okay?   Second misshap was when I was getting my massage for my pedi and the lady doing my nails mocked me of what I said. I looked her up and down and was kind of shocked at first someone could be that weird and do something like that.   Next thing was they kinda ditched me and hurried me off because they had some regulars who were of course snobby and stuck up, impatient when they were the ones late. I don't like that, I don't expect you to cater to me but I don't expect you to shoo me out the way. Don't talk to me if I'm paying you and the thing that comes out your mouth is to mock me. It isn't necessary.   Won't be back. Don't need to be charged 85 dollars for two services and a wax job to have lumpy gel manicures where the color isn't solid on the nail beds of my toes or hands.

I didn't like it.. Just tasted bland. Rolls were over sized. I don't like pieces that I can't just pop into my mouth and have explosions of flavors.  However they had a great soft shell crab.. And that was about it  Service was just okay.. Girl was super nice not very attentive..

Not good food. For my order wrong. I don't mind that because it means I might try something I thoroughly enjoy and would have never known if that mistake hasn't been made. However this was not the case. I had ordered fajitas.. Ended up with enchiladas. Lol I wouldn't have mind but then my food was so gross and bland I couldn't enjoy it at all. Waiter was extremely nice but lacked understanding .  Oh well.. It's on the strip. What are your going to do?

The games are a lot of fun. And the food is actually very good.   We ordered the Philly cheese steak and ribs with Mac and cheese. The chefs in the back forgot that we requested no onions on the cheesesteak, so when they brought it back they brought it back with no veggies as well.   We didn't mind but our waiter noticed and he realized it and decided to take the extra step in getting some veggies for us. It was extremely thoughtful!   Our waiter was very good and he was fairly attentive. His name was Justin and he knew the items well and the best way to handle situations big or small.    The games were so much fun. We ended up with a ton of tickets.. Got a few of the items (not much to choose from) which wasn't too fun and then decided to give the rest away to some cute little kid. It was a great time and money and time well spent playing video games for tickets. Too bad it wasn't money lol.

Just okay . Like in a previous review I'm from California and this place was just okay . Not worth the price and the service was mediocre and or sub par.  They did a good job on my nails but it was laid on very thick with acrylic.. Which I didn't want in the first place. I wanted a gel manicure and she objected to it and proceeded to lecture me as if I was a child and I did not like that.  Cave creek nail shop hunt... Continues NOT.  Waste of money. Drive further out I'm sure there's higher quality for lesser price

I thought this place was absolutely delicious and wonderful.   I had a steak here.. Filet.. So delicious.. I had this at about 1 am and the waiter was very nice, the place was fancy and wine to accompany my meal was very good.  Had a mountainous delicious brownie ice cream cake fudge situation for dessert and that was very rich but that's how I like it! It's a dessert duh! And you're at a place called sugar factory!   Music was hip, people were friendly, love that the food is good no matter what time in a day or night! I love this place! No real complaints except the table I ate on wasnt big enough for all my food!

Sexy handmade things! Lady was South American and very nice! She has wide selections and most outfits fit well on every body type! If I ever go out this way again! I would probably shop here!   Thanks for the hot red bikini!

Saving this best buy was this amazing and super friendly kid who had helped me find the final season of breaking bad.  The arrangement of movies was so random and instead of alphabetical category the best buy guys decided to just put it in categories of favorite shows and no alphabetical order within each category.  As pointless and unimportant this might sound to an individual, when you're dealing with 300 different movie titles.. It gets kind of confusing..  Luckily my best buy person never gave up trying to help and we searched for a good 10 minutes for the breaking bad final season.  On top of that I also grabbed the mindy project which is a great second Season so far and the first isn't too bad.

So good! Food is so hot and totally worth it. Made to order and I choose this place over a Panda Express or some other sh* Americanized Asian food place.  The food is fusion between japanese, Thai and Chinese. But it's worth it and this location shuts it down on all it's surrounding food locations.  Try it. Very cheap and very hot food served to your table

No complaints. The service was perfect. Two college kids with great attitudes and friendly service. They walked us through how it worked and even cleaned off our area while we sat and talked.  The decor was modern and very hip. Not a huge fan of the graffiti but it gives it individual sense of style. The pizza place really stands out I comparison to any resteraunt I've been to due to it's system and decorum.  Lots of toppings and because they have such a hot fiery oven it can heat up numerous toppings .  Items looked fresh and up to code no wilted veggies and the spinach is put into olive oil?   Also had a steak and blue salad. Just right amount of balsamic and cheese. Great portions for 20 dollars I was so full and ready for a nap.   First place I've been to in Scottsdale that really impressed me.
