I enjoy flying US Airways. Their seats are more comfortable than other airlines and the staff has always treated me right regardless of which airport I'm flying in/out of.

We need Dunkin Donuts in California! As for this location, their donuts were fresh and tasty. I'll visit them again when I'm back in the area.

Run down for a Radisson. They really need to invest in new furniture.

I've been here twice now and my wife and I loved it. The second trip we made out we brought our 10 month old daughter and she enjoyed it from the movie to the nature environment she loved every moment. We will gladly return the next time we're in Arizona.

Quick and easy. Loved the service, thank you for taking care of my rental needs in a professional manner. This location takes the time to make you feel welcomed. I rented a vehicle for a week while on business, flew back home for the weekend and came back the following week. The same garage greeter said hi to me and made reference to his co-workers that I was one of their frequent customers. The staff handed me a bottled water to help me cool off and relax while we finalized the check out process. I can't say anything bad about this location. What's funny is that I'm from California and each time I rented on these past two trips they gave me California cars without even realizing they had CA plates.
