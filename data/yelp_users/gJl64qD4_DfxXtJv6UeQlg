I'm happy to say that I've incorporated Guedo's into my weekly routine.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere is spot-on. I've read several reviews where people complained about the food being overpriced but I really don't mind paying a little extra when it comes supporting local businesses; especially a staple of the community like Guedo's.  If you're looking for a place with awesome food and an owner who cares to learn your name, come to Guedo's.

Normally I would give the restaurant a mulligan but I never felt at ease the entire time at UTL.  My experience had a rocky beginning when I wasn't greeted when I entered the restaurant - although I was outnumbered by servers 2:1.  After sitting down, I immediately switched tables because my first option was covered in crumbs and whathaveyou, only to move to a less dirty table.  My server never seem all that interested in getting my order correct however uncomplicated it was.   To be fair, the food was pretty good but I was too distracted by the aloof service, dirty tables, and awkward decor to be able to enjoy it.   I was excited to give UTL a shot and unfortunately left underwhelmed.

Super long wait, chronically understaffed. Expect to spend at least an hour here. Also, do not come anywhere close to lunch time. Better yet, just don't ever come here.
