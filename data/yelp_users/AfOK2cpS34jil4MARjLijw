This is one of my husbands favorite places for chicken fried steak. I'm not much for fried food, so I didn't order anything. But then my husband ordered his steak, fed me a bite and I remember being startled because it was fresh - not frozen. You could TASTE that it was not frozen. Probably the first restaurant I've been to that didn't have pre-frozen fried food. It's also beer battered. Flippin' delicious. It's basically like going to a southern mama's house and going for a home cooked meal.

My office just moved down the street and I decided to try this place out despite its shabby reviews because of its proximity to my work.  I'm glad that I did.  I ordered for pick-up (shrimp Thai fried rice and Thai tea).  Food was hot when I picked it up and she didn't make the drink until I arrived so it wasn't watered down.  Food is DELICIOUS.  They are a little skimpy with the shrimp considering the $3 up charge, but it was still delicious.  Service was excellent.    The environment was quiet and very typical of a Thai restaurant.  They also have a nice outside covered patio.  I will definitely be making this a regular lunch place!

I found this place when I first moved to Arizona two years ago because of its high Yelp reviews. It's been my regular spot ever since.   The service has always been great, their drinks are amazing. It's got a nice atmosphere and beautiful view outside. Reasonable prices. Pet friendly. Can't complain.   My only wish is that they served more food then muffins, protein bars and baklava. But I understand the reserve for a simple coffee shop.   I love it here! I bring all my friends who visit and they always ask to go when they come back!

This is a nice bowling place for families, people aren't too rowdy and loud. No wait. BUT they have the SLOWEST bartender and kitchen. I literally stood and watched for 10 minutes while she made one drink and a draft beer. It was like she was on slow mode. I stood at the food counter for 5 minutes before I was helped and then she told me to wait because someone else's order took 40 minutes and she needed to finish it. Meanwhile my bowling minutes are waiting away. And this was on a Saturday night.

I've recently moved here from out of state and was on the hunt for a new nail Salon. I researched this one on Yelp and decided to visit since it had such high reviews. This place is amazing. Great service at the door and by the nail tech. I always like my acrylics short and thinned down. She did my nails exactly as I asked and even went over the top on the gel polish. I wouldn't say it's any more pricey than any other nail salon considering the quality of their work. This will be my regular place.

I'm hoping my experience was poor because we went in the evening (close to bar party time for them) and not an everyday occurrence.   The food was sub part at best. I ordered a turkey wrap and it was soggy like it was premade and sitting there. The macaroni I got on the side was obviously siting under a heat lamp. When I go to a restaurant like this I expect made to order food, not the pretense of a left over.   The service was ok but when I asked of they had bread or chips and salsa to bring out before the appetizer she looked at me like I was an idiot and said "well...I mean I can bring you small crackers."  I don't need to be treated like an idiot for asking for something a lot restaurants have as a customary courtesy.   Won't be returning. No buenos in my book.

I've been going to this salmon for three years. I have curly hair and it's amazing to finally have a salon that doesn't shun natural curls.  This salon encourages natural hair (ethnic and non ethnic) and teaches individuals how to wear it on its natural state without supplementing society's perceived "straight hair is prettier" philosophy. In addition to this curly hair haven, the salon has EXCELLENT rates for color. You can't beat them! It's not just for curly girls either, so don't let that drive you away.   I recommend Lea Cake when you go. I've been seeing her for three years and she's never let me down. She's knowledgeable, friendly, and talented in her craft.

My husband and I are from New Mexico so we like to seek these types of restaurants out. This place has great burritos and service. Their fry bread is to die for. But I'd advise staying away from their tamales. Not authentic or very good. The queen creek location has a better lobby/waiting area. The front door is a few feet from the counter at this locational so if you have more than three people in line it gets uncomfortable.    All together, if you're looking for a taste of home, this is a good place to visit.

Update: So it's noon, and we order breakfast burritos, only to be told they no longer sell breakfast past 10 am. Let me be clear, this is not transitioning from French toast and pancakes to burgers and pasta, where I can understand not serving breakfast all day. This is Mexican food. And for a place that is called "New Mexican Grill" they should know that breakfast from "breakfast burrito" is a relative term and they are served ALL day in New Mexico (we're from there - we would know). People eat burritos for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  They just lost a large client base. We've been going there for years and we won't be back. It's just a bad way to do business, and as a result I assume he will sacrifice a large client base.

I tried this place because my regular shop is always booked; to the point where you can't walk in anymore. I looked on Yelp and this place had high reviews and was closer to my house so I decided to give it a try.   I walked in and was helped within 5 minutes. Tech was friendly, and they had a lot of color options.   They were different from my normal salon, in that they had nail tips in circle rings to let you pick your color, instead of it choosing your polish. Just a different experience I guess. Although I like picking my own polish from the wall, personally. Otherwise, the nail tips seem overwhelming.

Great pizza, horrible customer service.   I called ahead for an order, driving while I dialed so the pizza would be ready when I arrived. A woman answered curtly and asked to put me on hold. Not a problem.   After over TWENTY MINUTES minutes on hold she finally picked up, then hung up on me. I was already at the restaurant so I got out of the car and walked inside to place my order. I had already driven here, I wasn't about to waste gas because the lady was rude.   I walk in, and there is a lady at the counter, doing something with the register. She didn't greet me. I continued to wait and she continued to ignore me. Acted like I didn't exist. After a minutes of standing there feeling like an idiot, I just left.   Absolutely wretched customer service. They didn't even bother to be rude - they just ignored me. Both on the phones and in person.   I wouldn't recommend and won't be eating there again.

My husband and I went here for lunch one Saturday.  He kept going on about how good it was and I was skeptical at best because I'm not a sandwich person.   Boy, was I wrong.   This place is amazing. I'm a picky eater and had a lot of questions. The staff answered them eagerly and happily. I got the number 11 and it was the best sandwich I've ever had. Good food. Place was clean and welcoming. Staff was very helpful and even bagged my stuff up for me when I asked for a box.   Two thumbs up, will definitely be coming here again!

This place was a pleasant surprise! My husband and I were walking around downtown Phoenix checking out how they're setting up for Super Bowl, and we decided to stop in at this place. It's kind of like Subway in that you walk up to a station and pick your pizza topics/sauces/cheese through a bane window.  I didn't have high hopes to be honest but the pizza was finished in about 3 minutes and it was the best pizza I've had in a long time. I polished the whole pie! You can't beat the prices either, $7.95 for an 11" pie with whatever you want on it. We'll be returning for sure. two thumbs up!

I work within walking distance of this place, so I took a stroll over to pick up some lunch. The menu reminded me a lot of Ike's Sandwiches as the two are very similar. There is a diverse and robust menu with plenty to choose from for everyone, including the option to make any of the sandwiches a wrap or a salad. They have many choices of bread as well. I ordered "The One" (picture posted).   The food: excellent. Everything is made in front of you. Soups and  pasta/potato salad are homemade, nothing from a can. I saw another reviewer wrote hat she didn't like they used shredded chicken, but this was a winning point for me; I like to know it's actually chicken, not something that resembled chicken or went through a deep fryer. I was very impressed with the quality, look, and taste of the food.   The service: I was greeted by an older woman who I assume is the owner. She chatted me up and it was nice to get to know her. It's a great experience when you know the restaurant actually cares about what you think, and providing the best product/service possible. So much better than slapping processed food in a bag and saying "here you go."  She cared; that matters.   The Price: a bit steep if you're comparing it to the $5 Footlong but hey- you get what you pay for. I don't mind shelling out the few extra bucks for homemade food, prepared with care, toward a local business owner then a franchise who good give a rats tail how I feel about their stale bread or prepackaged "not so fresh" turkey. The sandwiches are big, mine will feed me for two days, so really, I'm getting the bang for my buck.   I'll be returning for sure! Is recommend this place to any and all.

Matt is a very professional  - he was prompt, neat, and thorough.  He came to my home to do a free on-site estimate of work.    He refinished our sun damaged alder patio French doors beautifully, they look like new.  He was even able to repair my half-hearted attempt to refinish them last summer.  The price was reasonable and well worth it.

This place is awesome. Super calm vibe. Nice staff. Very helpful when I asked questions about the menu. Food was delicious. I ordered the egg salad sandwich. Which is to die for, by the way. Clean. Not much more to say than that. I'd recommend it to anyone for lunch/brunch. Outdoor and indoor seating.
