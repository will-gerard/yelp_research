Hands down the best New York style pizza restaurant in Phoenix. Loved the food and beer selection and looks amazing inside. I got the veggie which was unique and way more delicious than the competition NY Pizza Dept. up the street. Can't wait to come back for happy hour!

Man this place has so much going for it but they need to get their staff in check. I had more bad experiences with bar staff, security in one night than I've had anywhere else on mill. At least 6 of my friends were kicked out, not for being belligerent, but because they looked "intoxicated". This place does not care for its paying customers and kicking out people that came to see a touring musician is disrespectful. Security was rude and condescending without giving reason for kicking anyone out even went as far as calling my friend an asshole for asking why he was being asks to leave.
