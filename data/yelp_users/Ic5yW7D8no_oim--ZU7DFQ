We live in the neighborhood and have given this place plenty of chances to shine. They are consistent in one area: letting us down every time.  We're "glass half full" people. We're optimists. In fact, I don't think I've ever given a place a 1-star review. But when it comes to Thai food in Arcadia, stick with Sa Bai around the corner. At Thai Lahna, they are consistently slow at delivering average Thai food (at best). And by "slow," I mean GLACIAL.   if you go, expect long wait times for basic curry and rice. If you order take out, expect even longer wait times. A recent example is when I called in for takeout -- one order, just vegetables in red curry with rice for my wife, who was working late and just getting home. She said they told her 15 minutes for a wait time, so I went over there in 20, knowing exactly what kind of service I was getting into. I took a magazine.  I was the second guy waiting to pick up my single-dish takeout order. The first guy got his order (also a single meal with rice). So did SIX OTHER PEOPLE who came in to pick up takeout after I had arrived. All of them waited, and waited. No one was happy. An hour later, I got my saucy veggies and rice. When I notified them that this was a constant problem, and that we wouldn't be coming back, the staff (who are not Thai and do not speak English) simply nodded and said something about being busy. Keep in mind that when I arrived, there was one guy waiting for takeout, and about 3 out of 12 tables occupied by couples. There was no apology.  Steer clear of here and pay the extra money for Sa Bai. You won't be disappointed. They're nice, legitimately Thai folk running a great restaurant with a takeout window. It's slightly more (about $12-15 for an entree), but you won't be disappointed the way we are every time we go to Thai Lahna. Or, if you fall into the Thai Lahna Trap, walk over to Autumn Court across the parking lot for some great Chinese food that is fast, hot, cheap and plentiful from a very friendly, enthusiastic and outgoing Chinese owner.   I think Thai Lahna would die a quick death if there was ANY other place to get decent, legit Thai food for cheap in the Arcadia/Biltmore area. There just isn't. As a result, we're stuck with this place.

Excellent service, excellent people. I really support Toyo. A little background: I'm a very mobile professional with a '99 4runner who loves to put miles on my car. Every time I get it back from Toyo, it's tight. It just feels like it's running in tip top shape.   Yes, they are a bit more expensive than other shops on some services. But to me, you get what you pay for. They have been servicing my SUV for quite some time; now it has over 223,000 miles on it. And I think it will go another 100,000. I have recommended Toyo to friends with Japanese cars without hesitation.

Baby Stop is a very clean and well-organized store in the Paradise Valley Mall area. My wife and I stopped by there because we wanted to shop at a local store and support "the scene" rather than drop a bunch of coin on baby furniture at some soulless chain store. But like anything in life, you have to accept the good with the bad.  We were shopping for a crib, a dresser, a rocking chair and a stroller. The selection is great, and the owners are EXTREMELY friendly and helpful. They gave us some honest opinions about the product that really helped narrow our choices. Their prices seemed reasonable given the ridiculous markup for baby furniture, and they were enthusiastic about making sure we got what we needed.  Unfortunately, that's as far as my good comments go. I want to give Babystop 5 stars, but I'm holding back because of delivery issues associated with the ~$3,000 worth of stuff we bought. We went WAY past buying a stroller, my friends: The order included a Romina nightstand and dresser, a Bonavita convertible crib (becomes a full bed), a Braxton Swivel glider and a matching ottoman. The Romina products are the top of the line.  We purchased everything at the end of March, and our due date was July 15. We received part of the order in late June/early July, but did not get the crib and dresser until YESTERDAY (August 2). The baby was born on time two weeks ago, so this was the last thing we needed to worry about in the process of having our first kid. Several frustrating phone calls were filled with misinformation about when the furniture would actually arrive; you'd expect a business bringing in a new line of product that is considered the BMW of baby furniture (Romina) to have its manufacturing and delivery dates memorized. As a result, owners said staff was disciplined about this issue and that it won't happen again. I believe them; I just wish we didn't have to be the ones who took a bullet for everyone else. (Come to find out we weren't the only couple waiting in vain for furniture that showed up 5-6+ months later.)   As a result, Babystop delivered our furniture in 2 separate instances: once for the furniture it had in stock, and once again when the crib and dresser finally arrived. But to add insult to injury, the delivery crew forgot one of our items each time they came and had to run back to the store to pick it up. So yesterday, their 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. delivery window turned out to be 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. We spent all day waiting.  To be fair, Babystop owners tell me they're a new shop that took over an old shop that was going under. I think in time they'll have their "sea legs" under them. But from our experience, they were extremely disorganized. My advice is to insist on speaking with an owner of the company and to get everything in writing before you leave.  Kudos to Kate at Babystop for giving us a "loaner" crib and dresser to use until the real stuff arrived. We really appreciated it.

We are superfans of this restaurant. With a wife and son who are vegan (and a husband -- me -- who's definitely not), Scramble covers all the territory with a smile. The service is friendly, the breakfasts are awesome (so awesome, in fact, we've never tried a lunch dish), and the place is clean. There's free coffee samples out front while you wait. Imagine that.   Scramble is a can't-miss for hangover brunches, families and catching up with friends. The vegan French Toast passes the Pepsi challenge: you can't tell the difference from the real thing.
