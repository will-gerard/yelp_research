The only couple things that were good were the tea and the bread.   The four of us ate for lunch and the food was barely warm. Two of us tried the butter squash tortellini. It was to have crispy prosciutto and it was soggy and the butternut squash was cut way to big.   Another had the shrimp pasta.  It was very bland even after adding salt and pepper.  Will not return to this chain.

Had heard great things all around about Rush Street so we decided to give it a try. Is says on their website that you can dine in, but the seats are very limited. Although it was tight, the staff made us feel very welcome and ensured we had a table to eat in there.   The food was flavorful, hot and tasted very fresh.  They have 8" pizzas that are only 3.99 and great for the kids.   They even deliver within a large range of miles.   We will return for sure!! I recommend it!!

Stopped in here quick to use the restroom and grab and drink. This is one of the dirtiest Starbucks I have ever been to. Not only was the food area not organized and clean the restroom is disgusting.   The associate behind the counter was also complaining that they were the last store to get upgraded on technology and it sucks. Really.....  Will skip this one for sure when in the area.

This is my favorite place to have breakfast while in Vegas. Eating out on their patio early in the morning is wonderful. Your straight across from the water show and over the sidewalk for great morning people watching.   There is nothing on their breakfast menu that we have found that we did not like. The staff is always very friendly and fast.   Make reservations ahead of time if you wait till mid morning to go and ensure your entire party is there together or you will not be seated on the patio.

The restaurant is tucked back in the tower. Just hop on the individual elevator off of the parking garage and it takes you right there. Entering off the elevator you are put into beauty from the floors, paintings and light fixtures.   The menu has a little for everyone and the service is top. Make sure to save time for dessert as this was everyone's favorite at dinner! The prices are higher than most restaurants, but well worth it.   This is also a French restaurant so make sure your pallet likes this type of food before trying it out.

We have been to Oreganos many times and this evening was one of the worst experiences we have ever had. With the exception of the waitress being polite and apologetic, the rest of the service was below average.  It took over 10 minutes to get just water and my husband had to ask were the beer was as it took another 10 minute to get that. We ordered one cheese bread and one regular garlic bread, out came both cheese bread. They happily took the other away to throw into the garbage. Then dinner. The 12" pizza was average. Kids each got a kid slice and we're fine. I ordered the Basta Pasta that I have had many many times before. It came with barely warm noodles, no cheese and two olives a couple sun dried tomatoes. The chicken was warm. I said something to the waitress and she happily returned to the kitchen.  When the second pasta was delivered I took one bite and this big chunk of brown something was in the pasta. Myself assuming it was sausage (not suppose to be in the dish) asked the waitress to please take it away. The manager then comes back to our table with the brown chunk to let us know it was not sausage, but chicken skin!!! Really, should of left it at sausage.   The actual reason we even went out was for our sons birthday (his choice). They both got a cookie desert and both came with ice-cream mush vs cookie and ice-cream on top. When you can't see any of the cookie and the ice-cream looks like whip cream - probably left it sit to long.    This Oreganos is not what is used to be here and the service surly has slipped. We will defiantly look to dine somewhere alternate that we can hear each other talk and the service is better.  Very happy that there are many more options in downtown Gilbert to dine now.

Worst experience ever!! Took my one year old to get his first haircut. I called ahead of time and talked to someone one the phone and asked if they had open appointments and they said no, they were walk in only. We sat for 40 minutes and watched two others that walked in after us and I finally went to the counter as asked what the heck was going on. The girl at the counter said they called in ahead of time. Are you kidding me!! Train your staff for consistencies. When someone calls then tell them they need to put their name on a list so they "get in line" before coming. Also found it amusing that the girl at the counter was doing nothing but standing by the phone and she was very quick to say that she was defiantly not the one to answer the phone.   Not only is the place overpriced, they need to clean their floor and seats. Hair all over the place.  Will not recommend this place to anyone and will never go back!

We love the Farmhouse so we decided to try the Gilbert House.  It is a very cute place and we had great service and food.  The kids meals are plenty of food still even for our 10 year old.   It was a bit hot in the back room we were in so recommend sitting on the patio if the weather is nice.  Will return there again!

I come here pretty often as this is a great place to get some work done and have great food and drinks.   I stopped in here this afternoon to get some out of the four wall office time and was going to treat myself to one of those amazing whoopie pies. Coconut it was and it tasted very good until I came across the red hair that managed to bake it's way into the side of the sweetness. (I am blond, not naturally, but still blond )  I brought it out the counter and the young man was very apologetic. I sat back down and he came over shortly with a $15 coupon for next time.   Because they are local and because they took care of their customer, I will be back.

Unusually love this place and have been many times. My hubby (his first dinner experience here) and I went out to dinner here on Thursday night and had a very poor food experience. They were running a BBQ special that he ordered. When the food came I was shocked that the chef would of even let it out of the kitchen. The ribs and brisket were extremely dry that they were uneatable.  Even the bake beans had the left under the heat lamp way to long look. After letting them know my hubby ordered the fish and chips as how can this be screwed up?  This also was very bland and he ate only a few bites after another waiting another 20 minutes.   We asked for the check and was shocked they did nothing. My hubby in 15 years has NEVER sent food back said something. Then comes out a manager I guess and at the loudest and squeakiest voice let everyone know that he did not like the first meal, but he ate some of the fish so unsure why we were asking for any type of discount!!!! So generous as they took $6 off our entire bill.   I have taken large vendor lunches/dinners here often and many family and friends. It will be a very long time, if ever that we will return.

This place is sure hard to find, but the pizza is surly worth the visit. The restaurant is tucked in the very empty old strip mall and the actual place is in the corner. They have been there over 25 years and the interior is pretty outdated. We had great service, but could of been we were the first customers there for lunch. The staff told us they are very busy during winter the snowbirds, but summers are much slower.  If it's your first visit the regular crust is a must to try. Sourdough pizza crust is delicious!!

We have been going to Gordon's for along time and since they continue to change their menus it is extremely frustrating. Our waitress even today expressed how it stinks to work there and try to manage through the menu. The small plates are way over priced for the quality of the food you get. Dry chicken with some lettuce thrown on top and potato chips with some sauce and flecks of cheese - no thanks.   We won't be coming back anytime soon.

Found on Yelp. Amazing burgers!! You build your own sandwich with TONS of options. The owners are super friendly and place is clean!!   The burgers come with a choice of a side also - Onion rings, potato salad, steak fries or chips.  Will come back for sure!!

Even with special diet requests they hit the mark.  The service and food was average at the beginning when they opened, but they are getting better at each visit.

I go here often as I have one of the nail techs Dena that I love the way she does my nails.  Today I was not able to see her as she was booked and I had Sophia do my toes. I had a fancy polka dots and a Mickey head on the toes as we are going to Disney World.  She did a great job and was very patient when I messed up one toe with my sandals and then she hit it when she put my sandals back on. I am sure the girls were saying I was a crazy lady, but I appreciate her patience and fixing it twice!

Good find for breakfast. They have great coffee and we had great service.   The homemade sausage is a must. We got a mix of breakfast food from Coconut vanilla bean dipped French toast to chicken fried chicken.  The pancakes are HUGE and very delicious.    Would give it another try!

I should have listened to my friends when they advised to not go to Seville Vet, but I had hoped with the close convenience of the hospital, it would of been a better experience.  The experience at the hospital was not necessarily with the doctor herself or the assistants in the examination room as they were all very pleasant, but the young ladies that work at the customer service desk.    After spending over $200 dollars the week prior for my dog to have her ears looked at I had asked the front desk how much my next appointment was going to be.  She stated all your having done is a follow-up exam, so it will be $30.  We showed up one week later and were shown into the exam room.  We waited another 10 minutes and the assistant swabbed my dogs ears with a Q-Tip and said yes there is still some matter in there.  Really...yes as I clean her ears every day I can tell you that.  I then waited for over 25 minutes for the doctor to come in and tell me that the dogs ears were getting better, but still needed additional healing time.  She did apologize for being so late as the other doctor had to leave for the day.  Get it.  Things happen.  Went out to the desk to pay by bill - to the more unfriendly one of the two clerks that work at the front desk and she stated it would be an additional $81 dollars.  I actually did laugh out loud and said "For what?  All you did was have me wait around for over 40 minutes and put a Q-tip in her ear.  You advised me it would be $30 only for the visit last week!"  I will openly admit I was being louder at this point and they told me I needed to go back into the exam room and wait for the doctor for my privacy of course.  Um no, you did not want me making a scene in front of your other customers.  I could hear the talking behind the door and then not the doctor, but another gentlemen that I had not dealt ever with came in and tried explaining to me what the other charges were for.  Sorry, I was not buying it.  I said I would pay for the exam as I was advised last week.  He then began to tell me that the front desk does not know what all the exams are about and they should not be quoting prices.  I again stated I will pay for the exam and I asked him what that final price was and he stated $33, $36 or $38 he was not sure. I then asked what happened to the $30. He looked at me and disappeared behind the door again.  More talking and then he came back and said $30.  Again walked out to the desk and dealt with the un-friendly front desk.  I did try to apologize to the young women for taking the brunt of my frustration and she was very short and snippy back to me.  I will be honest at this point I was also to her.    Being in the service industry for over 20 years, the front desk is key to your business and with the loads of options for vet care in the area, thank you for making it easy for me to choose somewhere else.

First time trying this place and will come back. The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly.   The lunch portions are great size and accompanied with delicious chips and salsa. If you want the hotter salsa you have ask for it.   I ordered the Spinach Enchilada were good if you love leafy spinach. Did not care for all the ends with the enchilada.

If you are looking for a dependable and honest heating and cooling company don't look any further!!  Arizona's Dukes of Air has years of experience and a very knowledgable staff.   They offer great discounts and don't charge for after hours calls. I highly recommend using them for all your heating and cooling needs!

My husband was wanting a breakfast burrito and he had recalled getting them from here a year ago. I ran over and picked up 3 of them up.   We we got home and started eating them they tasted awful. The eggs and meat tasted like yesterday's leftovers. No taste to the burrito and the salsas were just as bland.  For over $16 for three of them I will make my own next time.   Tried this place once, now twice and won't go back a third time.

This McDonalds has the worst service. We don't go to McDonalds often and the few times we have gone here they screw up your order. I did not check my order this morning and got home and sure enough a sandwich was missing. The other food also tasted like it was sitting under the warmer forever.   I tried calling the store four times and no one picked up. I then called the customer service department to tell them about the poor service. I don't have high expectations when it comes to fast food, but at the minimum put the right food in the bag.   Thanks for making it easier to not go back :-)

The store here is laid out very well.  It is more of a custom baby store, but has quality items at all diffrent prices.  Some of them my husband and I were sticker shocked, but with having our third baby nine years after the last lots has changed.  The staff here was very helpful and we will be registering for some of our items for the baby shower.

Thought we would try the place for lunch and sadly very disappointed. The food was poor.   We got two "beer" bread flatbreads and it was more like stale flour bread.  We were the only group in the entire restaurant for the entire time we were there.   They need to step up their quality or they will sadly be out.

First time at the yogurt shop and was a bit hesitate to stop by with the current reviews, but glad that we did.  The amount of toppings they offer is great.  The young woman working at the counter was very friendly and the yellow cake batter is really really good!  I was also pleased to see that it was kept clean.  We will be coming back here!

Needed a place to grab a bite to eat and get some work done. Was very surprised to find out they don't offer WiFi.  I ordered a sandwich & soup combo. For the price you pay, the taste was mediocre at best.  They need to understand what a salad is and not lettuce shoved into a cup. Also when you use lettuce for a sandwich, don't use the hard core parts.   The bakery looked appealing, but the comments from the people behind me said it looked much better than it tasted so I opted not to get any.   The environment is cute and they have home decor for sale, but I can get the same items at Hobby Lobby for half the price.   This will not be a place I will jump on going back to anytime soon.

My hubby and I had wanted something sweet and after forgoing the ridiculous line at Frost we looked up cupcakes on Yelp.   Due to the already amazing reviews we decided to drive over to Sweet Tooth Fairy.   From the moment we arrived the staff were so welcoming and friendly. We were able to try a cake bite for our first visit there that was delicious!!  We ended up getting three cupcakes and sugar cookies. They even were giving away a free sugar cookie on Valentines Day.    Will defiantly return to Sweet Tooth Fairy!

If you are looking to rescue a pet and make a huge difference in their lives, don't look any further.  Reservation Rewards Animal Rescue is the place to be.  Shelia works with the community to take in animals that are abandoned, abused or not wanted any longer.  She prides herself on making sure they are properly taken care of and they get the love they all deserve.  We have rescued two dogs from RRAR and have fostered others into loving homes.  Please take the time if you have the patience and understanding to give a rescue vs a breeder a chance.  Some of the best dogs you will ever get!

We gave the place a shot and my kids really enjoyed the yogurt. They have a wide selection and toppings to pick from. We went early so it was empty.   It will be a special treat for them as it is costly with kids as all is done by weight.    Will go back for another treat in the future.

We tried out the new place and were highly disappointed in the service. We waited over 50 minutes at 5PM on a Sunday which is to be expected so that was not an issue. The new exterior bar/sitting area is much better than the other locations and the fake grass out front was great for the kids to hang while we waited.   The issue we had was the experience after we were seated. We had to ask twice for plates and napkins from our waiter and he forgot our drinks more than once. We ordered two 18" pizzas. Not deep dish, nothing fancy. We waited and waited.   There was a family that was seated 20 minutes after we were and received their pizzas before us. The waiter came out and tried telling us the kitchen was backed up. He clearly did not know we noticed the table behind us.   We finally asked for the manager and that was also a very awkward situation. She came to out table and told us that we had asked to see her over 10 minutes ago, but she was pulled to another issue. Not something you tell a frustrated customer. Second she asked us what WE wanted  her to do about receiving poor service. Again not something you ask a frustrated customer.   WE - not the manager - figured out what we felt was fair after sitting and staring at each other for another awkward moments while she and the waiter stand staring at us.    Going to dinner here should not be a 2.5 hour affair. Not worth the hassle and wait for a thin low topping pizza.
