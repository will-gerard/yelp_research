I made the mistake of thinking I could dye my hair purple at home. After brushing my hair and clumps coming out I decided it's probably a good idea to get some professional help. I found this place on Yelp, called and spoke with Deven, who got me into see her right away! I can't say enough wonderful things about Deven! She took a lot of time educating me on how to keep my hair healthy and how to style it. Most importantly she made me feel amazing from the moment I sat in her chair  can't wait to come back!!!

THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE! ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.   I've been going to this place since it opened and today will be the last time I ever walk through that door.   I called in my order for lunch at 12 o'clock and was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. When I arrived there I stood waiting for someone to acknowledge me. When the girl finally did, I told her I was there to pick up my food. She asked me if I ordered something other then what I called in. After correcting her, she took my money, and I stood there and waited, and waited, and waited some more.   After standing there almost 20 minutes a woman came to talk to me. I explained how this was my lunch break and didn't understand why it was taking so long. She told me it wasn't taking long I hadn't put my order in until 12:23.   The lady kept arguing with me and then informed me that I needed church.   I hope no one makes the same mistake I made by going to this place.

Friendly and fast! Fixed the broken screen on my iPhone 6+. Looks brand new again. Couldn't be happier!
