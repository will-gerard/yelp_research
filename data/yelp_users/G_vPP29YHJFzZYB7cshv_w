Every time I come here the portions are smaller than any other filibertos. I've been in Arizona 15 years and quantity was their prize to fame!   I did a test tonight.  I ordered an Arizona burrito from here,  then on the one on 35th and southern.  One in laveen,  (51st and Baseline) paper thin.  Southern... proper! I'll definitely be making the drive based on this!
