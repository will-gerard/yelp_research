Was looking for Mexican breakfast and found this little gem. It was only $14 for 2 full size meals, they give you more than enough. The tortillas were very fresh and had that Nana taste loved them. I ordered the Machaca with egg, which is shredded beef with eggs. My gf ordered chorizo with eggs also good. Everything was freshly made. We went around 10am was not very busy and everything was fast.

Ordered the wonton soup..was nasty..the wontons were very starchy and filled with what looked like poop also had some old celery in it..fried rice was ok but felt gross after trying the soup.. Will not be going back.

Normal diner environment but nothing normal about the food!! It was delicious and you have to try the bloody Mary, the little mini slider was yummy! A little pricey but worth every penny!! We went around 11am on a Monday it was very chill and our waitress Leah was very tentative and polite. Will definitely be coming back.
