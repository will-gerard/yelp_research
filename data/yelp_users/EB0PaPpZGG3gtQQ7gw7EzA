Natalie who works here really went the extra mile ! I fell in love with a earring and necklace "set"in "deep clearance" and later wanted to add the matching bracelet ... She found it at another Zales. She then had it shipped to this store . It was difficult to find the piece but she never gave up and got it for me in less than a week ! Other Zales in the area and also in California were "unable" to find the bracelet for me . This sales person really went above& beyond !! I would go out of my way to come here for future jewelry shopping --- the Zales in Fiesta mall really doesn't measure up . This is the best Zales in the area & Natalie is the best ever salesperson !

I have many pieces of jewelry from Zales . This location has the WORST customer service and selection . The Zales Outlet nearby (ish) has a better selection ,and generally nicer people working there. Or go to any other jewelry store -- IN . THE. WORLD.  I have never felt so  simultaneously rushed & ignored,'til  I tried to shop here.

Love me some scattered smothered ' covered ,Hash browns ! And....    Cheesy eggs with raisin toast ! Pecan Waffle ( with honey)! Grilled chicken is always moist & flavorful ! Good burgers.grits...in a bowl with cheese , please !   Vanilla or Cherry Coca-Cola !Made by hand, from the fountain!    They know how to "cook to order" ! Your over medium egg will most likely be perfect . You could order your bacon crispy or soft. Interesting fact .... They are owned by Ritz Carlton.

We got discounted tickets( $22)at Costco that included free soft drink coupons & let us skip the lines . Great value . We arrived around 4 pm on a scorching 100* Friday,at the beginning of summer. This let us enjoy amazingly short lines in the hours before Night Splash ( discount twilight admission 7-10pm) " Night Splash" could also be known as " teen nite" though anyone can stay. The two 13 year olds we brought reveled in the " party music" and atmosphere. Lots of security around made us feel safe to let them " enjoy some big kid freedom", checking in regularly . Though we sat on the side lines watching literally 1000s of kids mingle that nite , none of them were smoking , or vape-ing, or being mean or rough towards each other . Seemed like a great place for teens to celebrate the summer. The staff is young , but were all attentive & nice the day we went.Be aware there is a limited food menu for Nite Splash. Not much "real food" or dinner . Had to leave sun-splash & go next door to Golfland for pizza , which was cooked fresh and price was average . Not bad.   I guess the only reason to give 4 not 5 is the park is older , (as in " Bill&Teds ExcellentAdventure" 80s retro older,)SO "regular"price seemed high & discounts were hard to find --glad we are with Costco. If you go during discounted hours , the lines for the slides get very long... So,Uh , don't be cheap? ---  AND not knowing we would be unable to get any "real food " -as in Dinner -in the park from 7-10 was a bummer .Also no pace to hook or shelves to place your things on , in the showers and changing rooms and toilets when the floor stays wet(gross BTW--- how about some tea-tree eucalyptus  or pine sol ?) No door hooks? That is super inconvenient . But we did have a REALLY GOOD TIME .so I would recommend Sun Splash , especially for teens .

Best chinese food in the Gold Cnyn, AJct, Mesa Area! Luches are a Great Deal! Soup& a whole tray of appetizers, fried rice, and a generous list of Main courses to choose from for under $6 ? WOW ! Dinner prices are fair too, esp. with such generous portions.We love their Hot&sour Soup , panfried dumplings( we use the potsticker sauce on eggrolls & wontons too --- yum!)pork(or chicken or tofu) & greenbeans  is my healthy favorite. Hubby loves the curried Singapore Street noodles or Lo Mein or House ( everything in it) Fried Rice. They even have a nice beer and wine selection. The best part though,might be the great service! FAMILY run , same smiling people, always there--- they do all they can to keep you coming back for more....
