The food was B+.  If you get the ribs, you'll have a lot to eat for $15, but the thing that made me give them only 2 stars was their service.  I asked the girl at the food window where I could find some ranch.  She said, "Outside" and rolled her eyes like I should have already know that.  Later, after having the ribs, my wife asked the same girl if they had any toothpicks.  She answered "Outside" and rolled her eyes at my wife.  Some blonde girls aren't cut out to be friendly to customers.

The food is great, but DON'T rush from the drive through without checking your bag for all of your ordered items.  And also check your receipt for that matter.  I ordered one meal, one sandwich, and one small fries.  Did not get our fries and the receipt says we were charged extra for the drink that came with the meal (that was given to us WITHOUT a straw).  So frustrating!!!!

Great food.  We loved the rolls!  I got the Country Fried Chicken (which was amazing) and my wife got a HUGE steak!  The food was so awesome!

I've been there with my wife 3 times in the past 5 months. Every time we go, the food is amazing, however the service has been unsatisfactory all 3 times as well. They really need to improve their service. We went there tonight at 8pm and the service was acting as though it was 3am...like he was tired and just didn't care.

Besides getting attitude about how much mayo my wife wanted on her sandwich, the employee named Assi made sandwiches for his friends for free, sat down with them (and ate his own sandwich when there were no customers), and continued a conversation with them while helping other customers. This would explain why he was so distracted that he closed the register before giving me my change.  Poor customer service.

Again, more issues from the employee with an attitude, Assi.  This time tried to fool my wife into thinking that Subway had closed early.  The current time was 8:45pm and they close at 10pm.  No respect and continued to treat my wife in a belittling way.  Is there a number I can call to fix this poor customer service???
