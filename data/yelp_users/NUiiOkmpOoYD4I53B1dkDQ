I liked these guys a lot.  They were fast, friendly, and sympathetic to my limited budget.  They were honest, helpful, and gave me a great price on the services I needed.  I'll definitely be returning to them in the future.  Plus, their front office and bathroom were very clean which is always a good sign that they care about their customers!

I just picked up lunch for my coworkers and they cant stop raving about how good the food was!  Everyone is already talking about going back.  I had the "man" salad and it was amazing.  Packed with good protein and gluten free, not to mention so fresh and tasty!  I'll have plenty of energy for a good workout after work and no stomachache from lactose or gluten.  Plus, the employees were friendly and upbeat in spite of the lunch rush.  Yes, the drive thru line was a little long, but completely worth it.  Great job, D'lish!  I'm so happy to find a fast, healthy local restaurant.

We used to love going to Dukes on Wednesdays for trivia.  Then they changed their menu, increased their prices, and didn't change the level of service.  I've never been treated so rudely as I was tonight.  I will not be returning to Dukes.

I have only had their coffee but it's pretty good and the employees at the drive-thru window are always super friendly.  We go before visiting the dog park and they always have a delicious treat and a friendly word for my pup.  She looks forward to it as much as I do!  Honestly, the friendly service and convenient location are what keep me coming back.

Tonight was the second time we've been to this comedy club and I don't know why we don't go more often.  It's a casual place, smaller than the other clubs, so there isn't a bad seat in the house.  The staff is friendly and quick, the food and drinks are solid, it's just an all around good time.  We actually showed up a few minutes late, but everyone was still nice and Howard found seats for us quickly.  Rather than worry about getting all dressed up and spending a ton of money to stand around in a crowd in Old Town, just go get some laughs, have some drinks, and enjoy yourself at this place!  (You can always go out afterward).  Thanks for a great date night and keep It up, Standup Scottsdale!

I stopped in for a yummy steak gyro lunch.  It was loaded with meat and the tzatziki was fresh and tasty.  The fries were pretty good, too.  I will be coming back to try more of the menu!

We went in around lunchtime on a Saturday, it wasn't that busy, and everyone on the staff was super friendly.  Our server was funny and helpful.  My fianc√© and I both got the Carver burger and I got the stuffed poblano pepper as my side.  The burger was great but the poblano pepper was the star of the whole visit - delicious!  I could eat a whole plate of just those!  They have Golden Tee and Buck Hunter, as well as a couch area with some board games.  They do trivia on Monday nights, too. We are already planning on coming back just to hang out, play games, and try some drinks from their good variety of draft beers.  Yum!

My coworker and I love chocolate, so we decided to stop in and browse after lunch.  Everything looked so good!  It was difficult to narrow our choices down to two pieces each.  I tried the lavender infused chocolate and it was heavenly.  It looks like we have a new after-lunch tradition!
