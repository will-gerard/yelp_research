I've eaten a Pete's off and on over the years and always thought they had pretty good food.  If you're looking for traditional "fish and chips", they way they serve it back East, you might be disappointed; however, if you're open to trying something new, you might be pleasantly surprised.    The real action at Pete's is in the fish and shrimp.  I'm not a big fan of their fries because I like  more McDonald's like crispy fry.  The key to their success has got to be the sauce, which I think is the best in the business.  One last thing, if you go to Pete's understand that Pete likes cash and doesn't take credit cards.  Yes, it's a pain, but the non-greasy food is going to be worth the hassle.

When President Clinton visited town he made a stop at Poncho's Mexican Food.  It struck me as an odd choice at the time, but also made me curious about the food.  Was Clinton just making a political stop or did he actually have some inside intelligence from forward operatives?  After eating at Poncho's, it was obvious that Bill knew a thing or two about Mexican food.  They have wonderful combinations and the restaurant has become a habit for our family.    PLEASE don't confuse this wonderful independent restaurant with the Pancho's Buffet restaurant.

I have to admit that I have a love-hate relationship with Lo-Lo's.  The chicken is incredible, the waffles are okay, but the service always drives me nuts!  I'm okay with the sticky menus, the soggy mac and cheese can be overlooked as well, but don't disrespect me or make us wait 30 minutes for a plate of chicken.    If you're not in a hurry, you will probably love this place, but be prepared for some southern style mosy-like service.    Here are some tips worth the read:  the chicken is great, but if you really want to taste some soul food, you've got to get the dark meat and collard greens with waffles.  When you order your drink, you've got to try the Kool-aid.  Yes, I'm serious!  Lo-Lo's you've got me all worked up again.  If you could just have some friendly, fast service, I'd be regular and you'd be a bit richer.

Love Fuego Bistro - especially their Chile Rellenos.  Come at night for live music or during lunch for the best prices. Either way you're a winner!    Helpful note:  the Chile Rellenos at dinner are made with scallops, shrimp and Mahi Mahi and have a great cheese sauce. Lunch are chicken and spinach with jack cheese and a red mole sauce.   Great flavored without too much heat. Quickly becoming one of our favorite casual Phoenix restaurants.

One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and certainly worthy of the Iron Chef.  The decor is kool, without trying too hard - and the food is absolutely fabulous.   If you're looking for a full-flavored dish, try the spaghetti and meatballs - they are to die for good.  Made with organic tomatoes and hefty, beefy orbs...delicious.

Crazy delicious gelato, the best I've had outside of Italy.  Too many great flavors to say one is a favorite, but I tend to order the pistachio, spicy chocolate or stracciatella (the Italian gelato equivalent of chocolate chip ice cream). This place is heaven on a spoon.

Nestled in the corner of the JW Marriott is Tuscany, a delicious little piece of Italy full of authentic Italian flavors, affordable wines and attentive service.  Guests are share in a journey of Italian cuisine guided by an experienced staff through an array of mouth-watering small plates, generous sharing dishes and individual entrees.   At Tuscany, hand-crafted pizzas, delicious pastas and authentic cheeses rule the day.  A seasonal menu focuses on locally grown produce fresh from local farms, as well as their very own organic herb garden.   Here's what I found:  Antipasti Bar This appetizer is a fun and inventive way to create your own plate of Charcuterie.  Make your own cutting board plate full of cured meats, delicious spreads and flavorful cheese.  We recommend the Salami, Prosciutto San Daniele and hand pulled Mozzarella.  Be sure you don't overlook the "to die for" Maple Walnuts.  The EVOO drizzled bread served with this appetizer was simply unbelievable.  Veal Marsala  Tender Veal, ridiculously fresh wild mushrooms, spinach and the same Mozzarella we raved about in the appetizer all covered in a delicious Marsala Sauce. This was by far our taster's favorite entrée.    Wild Mushroom Pizza A delicious pizza full of shallots, truffle oil, chives and sweet onions, perfectly cooked in authentic wood-fired pizza ovens. This pie had wonderful flavors, a nice balance of toppings and a drizzle of truffle oil that tied it all together beautifully.  Salsiccia Pizza The flavors of sausage, garlic sauce, Peppadew peppers and spinach come together in this fantastic pizza dish.  A healthy kick of crushed red-pepper for heat and sweet spinach made this pizza a favorite.  Sweet Corn Gnocchi Of all the dishes our group tasted, the gnocchi was the least appreciated.  We felt the consistency was off and it was just too chewy.  The accompanying sauce was flavorless and we would not order this entrée again.  Veal Ravioli The taste of spinach pasta, zucchini, brown butter and oregano came together in this tender homemade pasta.  There was a hint of sweetness and a melt in your mouth goodness we just couldn't get enough of.  Risotto A signature dish of Tuscany made of English peas, pancetta and sunny-up eggs.   We love risotto and this dish was no exception with its rich, complex and hearty flavors. Next time, we may add the optional spicy prawns, or rotisserie chicken.   Black and White Half chocolate brownie and half chocolate chip cookie, this desert is served warm with housemade vanilla ice cream.  While we enjoyed the taste, it was your standard fare found at a number of other Desert Ridge restaurants.  Berries in Heaven The name says it ALL. Fresh berries floating in a light, airy custard made with Limon cello, cream and mascarpone. HEAVEN served in an old style canning jar.  Tiramisu An Italian classic, but this Tiramisu was a little too sweet and a bit on the dry side for our taste.

The restaurant was small and somewhat difficult to find.  Our initial impression was that it was almost an afterthought, tucked into an out-of-the-way corner of the hotel; however, after sitting down in the luxurious booth and receiving impeccable service our opinions quickly changed.  Steve, the manager, was personable, professional and knowledgeable.  His recommendations were delicious and prepared as he described them.  The food was served in large quantities at reasonable prices providing a good value.  The quality of the fish and other ingredients was among the best we have tasted.  Our dinner was a unique and memorable experience that we will share and recommend to our friends.  My guest and I will return again.  Shortly after sitting down, Steve, the manager visited our table and introduced himself.  He made eye contact, smiled and in a friendly voice said, "Good evening, I'm Steve one of the managers here."  He explained the concept of the restaurant, briefly reviewed the menu with us and then provided a few recommendations, including the blue fin tuna appetizer.  The manager's behavior was not only personable, but he was professional and knowledgeable.  He made several suggestions we enjoyed and described them to us accurately.  The tables were spaced with a generous amount of room and uniformly set with the silverware wrapped in cloth napkins.  We did not see any flowers in the restaurant. The service stations in the dining room appeared to be clean, organized and well maintained.  The linens, china, silverware, check presenter and glassware were clean and without defects. The booth and table were sturdy and comfortable.   Bluefin Tuna The bluefin tuna was a large serving presented cold with a sauce made from soy and onions.  It was artistically served surrounded by small pieces of pickled wasabi, seaweed, green onions and a small purple flower.  The tuna was fresh and tasted like a prime cut found in the belly portion of the fish.  The bluefin tuna exceeded our expectations.  Kobe Skewer Two medium size skewers of American Kobe beef served hot and grilled to a proper medium.  The meat was flavorful and was coated with a black pepper robata-yaki sauce.  We enjoyed this appetizer, but did not find it to be a memorable part of the meal.  Bass Dinner The Stripped Bass was artistically presented on four medium sized leaves with a ginger soy sauce, snap peas and baby bok choy. It was a light and delicate entree accented by a fresh and flavorful sauce.  The serving size was large and could serve one to two guests.  This entree exceeded our expectations.  Shima Roll The shima roll was a large serving of spicy tuna surrounded by cooked shrimp.  The fish was artistically combined with rice, cilantro and avocado.  The entree tasted fresh and flavorful and would serve one to two guests.  The shima roll exceeded our expectations.  Baked Crab Hand Roll The Baked crab roll was made from fresh crab in a light hand roll with a delicate soy based sauce.  It was served hot and cut into two large pieces.  It was a generous serving for two guests and exceeded our expectations.   Creme Brulee The creme brulee was a traditional custard recipe flavored with vanilla beans and topped with a torched burnt sugar crust and garnished with a boysenberries.  It was served cold and large enough for one guest.  The ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful.  The creme brulee exceeded our expectations.  Banana Spring Rolls The banana spring rolls offered four different dessert style spring rolls served hot with a syrupy banana sauce and home-made vanilla ice cream artistically dusted with chocolate sprinkles.  This was a large dessert that could serve from one to two guests.  It was a flavorful dessert that exceeded our expectations.

New favorite!  The spicy tuna and jalapeño roll. Spicy and amazing!    The Katana roll was also delicious. It had shrimp tempura with tuna and yellowtail on top.

Before going to NoRTH, I thought it would be just another chain formula "Fox-in-the-box" type restaurant. Wow, was I mistaken! As a big fan of independent, mom and pop businesses serving up local flavor restaurants, I don't say that very often.  New York Steak The NY steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and deliciously tender.  Not on par with anything from Donovan's or Ruth's Chris, but a solid choice for the money.   Scallops As an avid scuba diver, I love seafood and eat scallops every time I'm near the ocean. These were some of the best I've ever tasted.  Tiramisu I enjoyed the tiramisu, especially the unique way it was served, but I don't feel that it was memorable.  Good, but not great.  Service Our service was attentive without being overbearing.  I appreciated the time our waiter took to review each section of the menu and provide not only suggestions, but commentary on the entrees.

Worst service and sandwich I've ever had at a Subway.  Jared wouldn't come here!

The food at Caffe Daniel is consistently amazing and the menu has enough variety that everyone is going to find something they want.  The decor is almost as attractive as the artistically created dishes.  Check out the oven if you want to see something truly beautiful.  While I haven't been lucky enough to attend, friends have raved about the seafood and paella themed nights.  I plan to give them my email address next time I'm in so I'll be the on list and first to know about upcoming theme nights.

The restaurant has a large sign at the center top of the building, making the restaurant easy to find.  Because the door handles are in the shape of a round sign, we found the door difficult to locate.  Once we figured it out we were inside.  The inside of the restaurant is well lit and attractively decorated.  The restaurant was loud, but we could hear music playing in the background.  The temperature was comfortable.  DINING ROOM The spacing between the tables was tight, but provided adequate space.  Our table had one chair and the other seat was a bench attached to the wall.  Both seats were comfortable and looked new.  The menus were clean and in good repair with no typographical errors.  The napkins, plates, glasses and silverware were all clean and appeared to be nearly new.  Short Rib Pot Stickers The pot stickers were served hot, attractively garnished with sesame seeds, mizuna and a yuzu ponzu sauce.  The portion size was large and enough for two to four guests.  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious.  This appetizer exceeded our expectations and will be one reason we will return to the restaurant.  Roasted Turkey French Dip The turkey French dip sandwich was served hot with a delicious horseradish aioli sauce.  It was attractively arranged with a simple, but tasty salad.  The serving size was large and enough for one to two guests.  The natural au jus was enjoyable and complemented the turkey and havarti on the parmesan roll.  The sandwich exceeded our expectations.  Wood Grilled Burger The wood grilled hamburger was cooked to a proper medium rare and delicious.  I was an appropriate size for one person.  The French fries were also enjoyable, but many of them were overcooked and burned.  I set them aside as I ate and was surprised that about one-third of them had been ruined.  While the hamburger was made from quality ingredients, I thought that it was slightly overprice at $13 and did not represent a good value.  Chocolate Ice Cream The chocolate ice cream was a medium sized serving of rich, creamy ice cream and was a good size for one person.  It was served cold and had not melted in the dish.  The ingredients were of high quality and refreshing to consume on a hot day.  At only $3, we felt the ice cream was a good value for the price charged.

The corned beef and eggs were great and the service was terrific.  A Phoenix version of the Prescott restaurant that won't disappoint.  I'll admit that I'm hard to please for breakfast, but Lone Spur Cafe is a new favorite.  Two tips:  hash browns aren't served after 11:00 am, so get here early if your a fan and the toast comes already buttered - if you're like me you just need to ask for it dry with butter on the side.
