Cornbread!!! Complimentary cornbread after your order. I love their margarita flight, the best is the 6th Street. It's a good place for lunch and one of the best places for happy hour

Of all the Banners, Thunderbird is the best. The medical staff is on point with the latest in medical technology and the rest of the staff is extremely friendly, I even struck up a conversation with someone is housekeeping. If I have an option, Thunderbird is always it

AMAZING!!!! I love small diner/family type restaurants and this hit the spot. I went with a friend who was visiting from Atlanta and she can't wait to come back. She had the French toast combo and I had the pancake combo with an extra side of sausage patties...it was awesome! The pancakes were fluffy and my eggs were scrambled soft juuuust right. I wish I lived closer to go more often. You should definitely try them out. They are open for breakfast and lunch

I've lived here for 4 years and the only good thing is the cost of rent but to be honest I'd rather pay more for better living conditions. The office and maintenance staff are pleasant for the most part but there is a serious lack of communication when it comes to service requests. The office has a phone number but you must be gifted to get an answer and if you think you're doing the next best thing by leaving a message you're wrong because it won't get a response. The security gates NEVER all work at the same time. Once upon a time we had gate clickers to get in and out and were told they'd be updated with new codes and redistributed....still waiting on that new code...that was 2 years ago.

This Native is one of the best. The bar has good service and a great crowd, especially on game nights. I really like the service in the dining room. The drinks are on point and the food is good. I will definitely be nah

It was okay, but I'm pretty sure I won't be going back. They had a $29.99 special for a mani and pedi. I ended up paying $45; $55 including a tip (I used to work in the service field).  Mike said gel would only be $10 more but then said my mani itself was $25. The pedi was supposed to include a hot stone massage and that didn't happen either. I can see the brush strokes in my nails and they are cut VERY crooked. I had to come home and make my own adjustments to have straight nails and toes.  When I first asked in I wondered why they were so slow on a Friday...Now I know

This was my first time at Postino's East and I had s good experience. I went on a Tuesday and it was crowded so make sure to get there early   Once we were finally seated the servers were very attentive and friendly. The food was great and the wine selection was nice.

I love the Rev. It's quick, close, and full of healthy options. They are open for a good portion of the day and there are always affordable options

Not the best location which is sad because it's the closest. The guacamole is like water and the meat is bland. Pretty disappointed

I just left this smoke shop and I am SO SO satisfied. The ladies here are extremely knowledgeable and went above and beyond to help me and my friends. They both took the time to help us and really educate us about the different products and tools. They gave us great recommendations and sent us on our way with some great products at some REALLY GREAT prices. This was an amazing experience and I will definitely be back

I need them to relocate to Phoenix!! This was one of the BEST experiences I've had. This place is much MUCH more than just a foot massage...back, shoulders, temples, crown...literally from head to toe!! This will be my first and last stop the next time I go back to Vegas.

The Laveen Barro's is definitely one of my favorite pizza places. The staff and servers are friendly and greet me as soon as they see me. I usually go with my friend but there are always several other patrons; families, groups, couples. It's pretty chill. The food is great! My order on demand is the veggie special with a side of honey hot wings. The cheese ravioli with meatballs is also amazing!  No negative words for Barro's

I've been to a few dispensaries but Bloom is by far the best! This is my happiest place on earth. The front desk staff are amazing and the guys in the back are so knowledgeable. I definitely recommend Bloom. If you're on another side of town it's still worth the trip

I loved the mango-mandarin margarita. It was awesome. Definitely try the standard, crispy fish, and pork adobada tacos. The servers were friendly and attentive.  I'm looking forward to coming back

Awesome nail techs! I still can't stop looking at how good my nails look and it's been a couple weeks. I got a gel mani and a basic pedi and it was so worth it. I'll make the trip back to Reilly's

I'm really saddened to have to post this, but I am really disappointed in Smoakie's. Like, I just threw almost $26 worth of food away. I went with my friend. When we arrived there were only 2 other customers in line. I ordered first; a 2x2 platter with ribs,  "hot links", mac and cheese, and Smoakie beans, and half a chicken.  My friend also ordered a 2x2 with the brisket, ribs, mac and cheese, and collard greens.  After my friend and I ordered, two more customers came in. I received my order in a timely fashion but I began to question what my friend had ordered because the people who came in after us got their order before she did. After about 20 minutes we left. The staff was very friendly but kind of slow.  Disclaimer: I tasted everything before adding any sauce.  I really only got a smoked taste from the chicken. Everything else kind of tasted boiled and bland. The sauce was a sweet sauce,  a very sweet sauce. Maybe honey, but not very tasty  The hot link is pork and is very mushy on the inside with no flavor and no heat, so no bueno. The mac and cheese tasted like a mix between kraft and Velveeta with a hint of nacho cheese sauce.  The Smoakie beans have pork brisket, peppers, and onions. Now I normally don't judge food by its appearance because I've eaten a LOT different foods and some have not looked appealing but have been FANTASTIC. This was not the case with the beans. Again, very bland, the beans had no flavor. I had some of my friend's collard greens and they were salty and looked canned. They were not very good at all. The 2x2 platter is $14.99 and the half chicken was $9.99. I'm so sad because I was really excited when I saw this place open.  My 4 year old nephew wouldn't even eat it and he eats EVERYTHING.  I gave it 2 stars because the staff was really nice but I'm pretty sure I won't be going back.
