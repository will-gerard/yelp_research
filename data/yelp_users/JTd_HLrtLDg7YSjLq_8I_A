Well, I broke away from my norm which is the lunch lounge across the street in the 501 building to see if I could get a little change, don't get me wrong, the lunch lounge ROCKS! five stars!!! but I wanted to venture out & heard about this place from some co-workers. After waiting 15min to order???? another 15min for my food & Oh BTW having to repeat my order to the girl, I finally got my ham sandwich. The bread was stale & chewy, this was on a Monday and I'm assuming made with old bread left over from the Friday or week before, the ham tasted so processed, and cut a lot thicker than I'm use to? My chips were passed their best eaten by date and the staff just seemed real quite and not so upbeat? I'm going to save my money, walk back across the street and go back to the lunch lounge! their line may be longer for good reason, but I've never waited more than 3 or 4min to place my order, and never more than 10min to get my food. True it takes a couple more minutes to walk across the street, but the Food & service offsets the time, and the staff makes up for that with their fresh, friendly, upbeat attitude! So take it from a true professional foodie, save your money, take the trip across the street, and enjoy some real fresh, home made delights!

Been going there, since I was a kid! Still a great place to gather, large parties of 8 or more never seem to be a problem. The Irish Mexican pops out a mean cheese crisp! And they even have wheat tortilla's! Foods fresh, place is clean, service is great, & the tacos ROCK, but for a kick, my fav. is the green chili burros done enchie style!! Race on over.

Look, don't try and count any calories here, you'll simply just be wasting time that could better be spent savoring one of lifes best & most plesureable sins!!! Thank God it's right here in good'Ol Phx, Az. If you like and I mean LOVE, high fat rich & creamy ice cream churned to order? Then run don't walk, a speeding ticket may be worth it for one of those super malts w/the harder little scoup at the bottom of the cup!!! OR even one of those pints 2-GO!!! Be right back....time for an Ice cream break!

Well??? Let's see???? Where to start??? Had a reservation for 3, myself, my girl, and my mom (she was celebrating her birthday), So, Sat, 6:15 reservation, we show up prompt at 6:14. They seat us right away, and I'm excited, as is Kiri my girlfriend as we have already read the menu. The place is way tricked out cool, in d√©cor!!! but strike #1 very high celling's, making for an extremely loud dinning experience. However the booths are nice, the lightings very cool, but oh yeah strike #2, my eyes are pretty good as far as sight & I'm somber, but even w/readers & my led smart phone flashlight, it's still very hard to read the menu??? Now you must understand that I have an onion allergy and if you do??? listen UP!: Starting with the apps, everyone of them contains onions of some sort & can not... I repeat CAN NOT BE PREPARED WITH OUT? WTF??? On do second course salads: every dressing is made with onions and your ONLY options is oil & vinegar??? Oh yeah!!! YIPPIE!!! I'm having a blast! strike ###3, but it got better, now I digress, Assuming now that our sever knows the allergy exist, we attempt to move on to main course: first up chicken scaloppini I order, Kiri orders scallops, and my mom, like me, chicken scaloppini, 10 mins pass, server comes back, and states that my dish has onions in the sauce, I say ok....what can we do??? she shrugs... IDK???? I ask her to please go back and ask the Chef what they can do??? 5min later, she comes back and says: "the chef say's all the sauces, puree's/grays have onion", but still no word on what we can do??? I ask again, she say's IDK??? I'm like WTF??? please get me a menu so I can try and make another selection??? DuH! Now the table has been held up at least 30 mins??? Finally, she tells me I can have the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin on a bed of spaghetti squash!!!! YUM!!!! I ORDER! YES!!! 10mins later the manager walks up and says "hi I guess there was a problem??? I say, no we got it worked out. I'm allergic to onions, but the server got me on track with the pork tenderloin!!! He said "NO" It has onions in the squash???? WTF!!!! many mins go by, he gets it straight w/a potato puree instead, which I was told had onions, GEEZZZZ anyone still keeping up? Because only now does everything go down hill. Plates all come, my tenderloin that I ordered mid well (that slightly pink about 160deg internal temp inside, is all pink and bloody juice on plate....NO! Kiri's scallops are4 tiny scallops the size of a .50cent piece three seared only on one side and one not seared on either side and chilly cold in the middle???? WTF!!! we have to send our two plates back for do over.... "RE-FIRE" meanwhile, they leave my moms on the table for 15min and she waits for our food to return, only to have her's go cold....WTF! YOU THINK A PLACE LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE PULLED ALL THREE PLATES AND RETURNED THEM ALL HOT TOGETHER? I'm in the business and just call them as I see them???? SAVE YOUR MONEY!

We Stop in  Friday night because we saw a lot of traffic & cars in the parking lot. WoW! is all that I can say! Take a lesson struggling restruants, this place was packed to the gills, service was spot on! The food, (had the fried chicken, my Girl had BBQ Baby backs) was hot, fresh, and done perfect, now I have spent 25yrs in the south, & my girls from there and these two dishes made us feel right at home! Whoever is doing the hiring & tranning at this place knows whats up. GREAT JOB Corbins! Everyone get over and try it, I'll be back!

Out doing some shopping w/the Ms, Stopped in for a quick bit to eat & WoW was the place packed! She had never been & I had to see the Hostess for a table, when two seats at the bar opened up. Now my honey doesn't useually like sitting at the bar stools as she has a bad back but we were kind of in a hurry, as is everyone this time of year. I hadn't been in a Chompies since 1980...WoW what a mistake, I forgot how damn quick the service was & how GOOD the food was!!!! My girl even said the bar stools were comfrotable & that this was here new favorit place! I will be back soon!

Ok I own a Subaru and went to the Camelback Mazda/Subaru lot to pick up a part. As I was carefully backing into the parking space, this women comes flying into the dealership, talking on her phone, slings her car into the parking space next to me and almost takes out my 12hr old car that I just bought! She parked her car so crocked, I mean just past the white lines on my side, that its now a struggle for me to even get out of my car???WTF??? And without regard, respect or consideration, just starts walking away??? When I finally get out, and confront the big dumb bleached bottle, black root showing, 80's hairdo women. I let her know what a crappy park job she did, and how rude and disrespectful she was. Her reply..."Oh well she says" Yeah! that's how I roll she states LoL, At least I kept it between the lines... then she proceeds to check the side where my cars parked. And then says, "Oh well I guess I didn't keep it between the lines...LHFAO! and go's on to say its ok, I the Mazda Rep, so don't worry about it, tells me that she is sure that I will get over it. I told her that as a car guy, at a dealership, where I frequent, that she should try and show a bit more respect for the customers. She says... Do You Mind! I'm trying to talk to my Mother on the phone and I'm late for a meeting? Now here's when it gets good. I went into the Mazda show room to speak to the manager, and was directed to the Subaru show room, where the "GM" DAVE MONTOYA of both dealer ships resides. I tell the receptionist, she's applaud and now go's and gets the Subaru sales manager, who I never wanted to speak to, and told him so. he then proceeds to make me wait for what seems like eternity. Finally Dave Montoya appears, I tell him what happen and go as far as to say, even though I would never by a Mazda, Now I'm seriously considering if I even want to shop Soobies here! Oh He says... I'll get right on that...NOT! he walks away, sends the sales manager back to me to take my number and name???  like you don't already have that, I've bout several cars here? and then he goes on to say that he's going to convey all this to some women in customer relations named Misty??? and she would call me, What??? Total brush off. Terrible customer service! Not to mention I never got a call back from anyone. BOTTOM LINE, Its tuff enough buying a car, but then to be treated like sub-human crap! My advice..." IF THE COMPANY CAN'T KEEP IT'S REP'S AND MANAGERS, AND ASSOCIATES IN LINE, THE THEY JUST DON'T GIVE A SHIT! AND THEY DAMN SURE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU THE CUSTOMER" I did't buy what I set out to buy their. Now I did drive straight over to PEORIA SUBARU and spent $1000 bucks. I will never go there again! And I say to anyone even thinking about looking at a Subaru or mazda, TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT PLACE!!!!!! if YOU LIKE YOUR CARS, BECAUSE THEIR CAR GUYS AND GALS DONT GIVE A SQUAT ABOUT CARS....YOURS, MINE, THE ONE YOU MAY BUY, OR THE ONE YOU PARK ON THEIR LOT! Some one should have told the big dumb blond to mover her car and park it right!

This place is Forkin great! Extream Chil atmosphere. Very laid back cool vibe! You don't even realize that your in a store front/strip mall. Chef & owner operated, I believe by the same folks that own Stumpies. All fres!, All tasty!! basically.... It's All Good!!! Just a bit pricey, if your not use to real food made by real Chefs, but I don't think you'll be upset paying your bill. Shop smart, take a friend and remember to share, portions are generous. I had a prim rib beef sandwhich, w/some great aujus, got a side of garlic aioli....50cent more, came with lots of choices, nice big plate of food w/salad like $10BUCKS Great wine & beer selection and on the thirteenth of every month, by on galss of wine get the second for just .13CENTS!
