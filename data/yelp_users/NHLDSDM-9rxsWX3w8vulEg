I have eaten in, and done delivery now. So...eating in, pretty darn good. Passion bread is a perk, and the pizzas are great. Wings, not bad. Delivery...something bad happens on the way to the drop site. I think, well my boyfriend and I hypothesize, that since they bake their wings/boneless wings, they aren't as crispy. But maybe, during the drive over, they get even more soggy.  I predict there are better places to get delivery wings on a Sunday Funday football game dinner. But make up your own mind...

They re-upped our wedding cake for us for our first anniversary. Our actual wedding cake was made by the Biltmore, and it was so tragically awful that we threw it away. That's a diff review though...I digress.  The way I found this place was my mom called in a cake for my husbands bday last November, his favorite flavor is fun-fetti (why wouldn't it be?) So my mom ordered it and paid for it from MI and I picked it up. They worked with her over the phone, super polite and helpful. The only thing is, they don't put the actual sprinkles in to the batter. They just add them on top of the frosting. Which is fine. But I just don't get why they don't put them in the batter. I'm not a baker, but this would be the only objection. Otherwise it was absolutely delicious! For our anniversary I got the same fun-fetti version. 6" vanilla cake with buttercream frosting, and sprinkles. It was delightful. Their cupcakes are great too. I've stopped in once to try the champagne cupcake. Super yummy. Give this place a try!

Best burger place. Lived her for 5 yrs, and only Indulge burger comes even close...but still by a long shot. The turkey burger is amazing, and the caprese sandwich is even to die. The most quality ingredients around. The salads are delicious, the deserts are incredible, and if you don't mind the possibility of a wait, the staff is great too. Not to mention the beer selection is off the hook. Something for everyone. Don't have a take on the wine, not a big wine connoisseur. And also not a red meat eater, but I bring all of my out of town visitors (from the midwest...they know their beef) and they love it! MmmMMmmMMmmm!

Joe, Jason and Jesse (J power!) were great. They made a stressful and other wise gut wrenching move, bearable. I was even moving to a two story condo, they handled it like champs. I had some super heavy pieces, but they brought the proper gear and made it look so easy. I am so grateful for them, and their professionalism, they took great care of my stuff. I didn't get the extra insurance option. My move in total was $390. I think the price was well worth it. All together, they showed up at 8:30am as expected, and were finished unloading (so fast!) by about 12:30pm. Outstanding. I went from approx 2,100 sq ft to approx 1,000 (so only took half of the stuff, but still...) plus patio furniture. It all fit snugly in their truck (I think it was 52'). Thanks again guys!

SO I have eaten in here, as well as gotten delivery. When we dine in, the passion bread is a nice complimentary touch, pizza is pretty good, and wings are yummy too. However, something bad happens between the restaurant and delivery. My boyfriend and I hypothesize it has something to do with the fact that they bake their wings, but upon arrival (earlier than predicted even!) the wings/boneless wings are mushy and vinegary...bummer. We ordered delivery out of necessity since it was a Sunday night football kind of day (drinking), and we were a little disappointed. Oh well...make up your mind for yourself.

Great service, despite being the only ASU fans on an OU game night. They accommodated our growing party. Food was great, stuck to apps. Our server was fantastic, thanks Gaili! We will be back, since we don't get the PAC12 network at home. Thanks!

We live across Thunderbird, in a residential neighborhood behind the condos. We moved in in December, and were optimistic that there were pizza/burger joints in walking distance. Upon trying the pizza, by our third visit/take out, we figured out that they have a one size fits all attitude that leaves much to be desired....bigger is not always better. It's a flavorless crust with greasier than necessary toppings. Then, we tried Charr, for burgers, since that's all they do, we were again hopeful that our burgers would be terrific. Such a pitiful excuse for a restaurant. First off, the server argued with my fiance about putting mustard on her turkey burger, and then neglected to honor my wish of medium for my burger. It was cooked all the way through, and the garlic knot bun is not a suitable vessel for the patty because it is too firm and crushed the toppings and it all squirts out. The service was so slow even though the place was almost empty during "dinner rush." The fries are really small, and too salty, sweet potato were also a disappointment. To top it off, this evening, my fiance was at home and could hear loud band/bad karaoke sounding music (which we have been hearing Thurs-Sat. since memorial wknd it seems) come blaring through our back yard starting 8pm. She traced it's origin to Charr, and asked to speak to the mgr. Joe Aiello (owner) fielded the complaint. He was a page out of Kitchen Nightmares, first arguing with her that as a business he didn't have to honor her request. When she suggested he turn it down or reposition the speakers, so as to keep the other possible neighborhood customers happy and returning, he insisted that as a bar that having this band as entertainment was beneficial. He called her rude for asking, and started to pressure her and intimidate her toward the door, trying to kick her out, he just cant take the criticism. This is not the kind of customer service you would expect to be given to someone who could bring in a lot of repeat sales. He is extremely unprofessional and it shows throughout his establishments. The food, service and ambiance in general is all sub par and reflective of his attitude toward guests and the Moon Valley community. NEGLIGENT! We highly recommend skipping this place, just head to McDonalds. We will not be back!

I really just love this place...for take out.  We've dined in a few times, but the wait is usually very long (duh...because word is out that it is fantastic) so now we take out 90% of the time.  Our favorite collectively, is the Big Star pizza, my husbands favorite is the Pepperoni and mine is the At Last.  The flavor combination on At Last as a meatless pizza (and I'm a meat eater!) is so well thought out.  I feel like I'm a judge sampling a pizza on a cooking show or something.  Seriously.....try it.  And tonight, we got (our first here) dessert, the Lil Triple.  It was really good. The chocolate cream is more like just chocolate pudding.  But it was cute anyway. And the staff who takes and hands off our take out order are just the nicest and most attentive. We had Josh take care of our take out order tonight, and he was great. Just go...it's worth a bit of a wait.  Bring friends, have some drinks at the bar, the beer selection is great too! Brava!

I like what HMShost is trying to do here by bringing in more up to date attractions/restaurants to combat the negative review in 2012 stating SkyHarbor as one of the worst places to get a bite.  The hostess was sweet. We opted to sit at the bar, as it was very crowded. After being ignored by the bartender, my husband got up to ask the hostess if we could sit at a recently vacated table. She obliged, just in time too, because after her got up, one of the bartenders left the beer tap on directly in front of his seat and beer started to over flow on to the rail and on to my Husbands phone. I caught it in time.  At the table, and our server was Jake. He was pretty awkward. Husband ordered the chicken wrap, I ordered Testosterone salad and we split a mac and cheese. Jake turned around before I could tell him how I wanted my steak cooked. Husband ended up liking his wrap. Chips were good. The Mac and cheese was ok. But my steak was borderline still mooing. I sent it back and got the green side salad. Turns out I don't like blue cheese. Or maybe I don't like how much of it was in the salad. Either way, not impressed. My water glass went empty for he second half of the entire meal. And my husbands coke was only filled when the hostess (yes, not the server) asked me if I wanted to send back the salad, then she took my replacement order.  Go to McDonalds instead....I feel like I say that a lot. And I haven't been to McDs in yrs...so take that for what it's worth. Ha

I was a crossfit virgin before stumbling in to this gym one year ago. But I sure was lucky I found it. While it's kinda hard to find (tucked away by the deer valley airport) it's surely worth it. The coaches are all fantastic, practicing safety/form first, heavy weight second. They always encourage scaling to your ability level, which helps keep people coming back. The equipment is almost all brand new and is very well taken care of. Ropes, tractor tires for flipping, atlas balls, the whole deal.  I always thought I was in a great shape, settling for the reality that I would never do a pull-up with my own body weight. Nearly 6 months later, I had three strict pull ups and 6 kipping. Mission accomplished. Yet...I can't help but keep coming back!  The community at this gym is second to none. It's one of the best parts about it. If you like group work outs and love crossfit, don't miss out. Visit this gym!

Over all we are super satisfied with the front door and sliding door wall we received. The price was fair and the finished products are beautiful. Our doors were a train wreck to begin with, needless to say I was crying tears of joy when I was able to shut our front door and not see any light shining around the seams.   Jason and the team were quick, clean and respectful of our home during the installation. My only comment would be the install took several visits, and though he set up a tentative time to come back and complete the project (multiple times), often times that date/time would roll around without so much as a phone call or text from him to let me know they were on their way or had to reschedule (which is what happened twice.).That's unfortunate because I took work off to meet them, only to be disappointed when they no call no showed.  They seemed spread thin, it's good to be busy but without proper communication that could be a problem in the future for their business model.   Of course, eventually (2weeks from start of project to completion) it's all good and done, and we are super happy with the doors. The solar tinted sliding glass doors are a must!
