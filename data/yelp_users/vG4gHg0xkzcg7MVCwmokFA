The food is delish! But beware the salsa is hot hot hot just like the plates! Service was really good too! Prices seemed right on as well. I know we will be going back as it is a favorite foodery with the hubbies family!

Great Breakfast! And priced pretty reasonably almost cheap actually! The server was terrific! She took all three orders without writing a single thing down and delivered us our food exactly as we asked for it! And food was brought quickly and hot!!  Definitely going back!  add on - The boyfriend and his BFF go often and are always happy with the food and service!

Seriously good ice cream!! Mint mint chocolate chip!!! I really thought the young folks behind the counter were outgoing and seemed to enjoy their jobs. That always makes me happy to see, as I feel I am supporting a good employer!

Bought a DealChicken special for our anniversary...Super happy!!  This was a terrific dining experience! Ambiance is romantic and quiet. The staff was attentive and helpful to use first timers.   I have always wanted to do Fondue but hadn't until now. I wasn't disappointed! I read the Yelp reviews before hand, so I had an idea of what I was walking into. No surprise that dinner took 2 1/2 hours. But we were celebrating and I LOVE the company so no complaint! Celebrate we did! Our waiter was super in guiding us through the experience and helping us decide what flavors. Everything was really tasty! There is a seasoning that is called Garlic and Wine that they serve as a seasoning and we brought ourselves home a bottle and use it on all kinds of stuff, but mainly our salad. It was a good deal for only 7.98.  In conclusion, I don't really care to have my meat basically boiled so I wouldn't be a regular...But I will be back for the cheese dip and dessert portion of the meal. My honey on the other hand had no problem with the entire dinner and looks forward to returning.

Start your review...The price was right on and the quantity was fat! The food was tasty! Seems the husband and daughter have been going here for a while and they love it too!

I love this place! It's the best dive around and within walking distance from my house in case I need to walk home. But taxi's are lined up in case you aren't as lucky. It is a small place with the same employees FOREVER! So it is easy to get to know everyone. And I love getting a hug from the door guys whenever I get there! For me it is my own little CHEERS!  Be prepared for the scantly dressed beautiful women who dance on the bar and hula hoop from the rafters! If you are saddled up to the bar you just might get a boobie hug from your bartender as she spends some time greeting her guests! The music is GREAT! The crowd is always friendly and Jack's team believes that NO ONE should be thirsty!   The DOGG is a see it to believe it kind of place! So come on down and if you see me give a YELP!!!!

I was pretty apprehensive about going to this place after reading all the reviews. But boy did it make me feel prepared! I saw Jimmy eat World. Great concert!! Sucks to be short! LOL  Not a huge wait at the will call window, security was a breeze, but was NOT asked to remove our shoes. As I said I was prepared! Cash, ID and lip balm was all I took in. My daughter took a small purse but was not hassled in the least.  I cant review the bathroom as I never made it in there. The water was $3 bucks. Not bad... Place started out clean...Hate that tall people can never seem to care that the short folks can't see through them, forcing me to get pushy, as we had been standing in our spot for an hour before said tall peeps decided to push forward. Nothing too physical but no security swarmed us as i grabbed hair and elbow checked a few peeps. Nobody seemed to care when a very drunk girl just randomly fell into the crowd causing some concern for those around her... I am glad I read up on this place before hand because I was prepared for whatever came my way, but my experience was nothing like the other yelpers...

My boyfriend and I LOVE this place! The burgers are cooked right there in front of you so they are really fresh and hot! No worries about what you want on it except cheese. There is a condiment bar so make it your way! There fries were pretty good. And the burger maker guy was cool! The cash guy lacked personality but maybe he was having a off day! The only draw back is the cash only part...But 3 of us ate for 25 bucks!!

My bff Mike and I went here for dinner one week night a few months back, and we hit the doors pretty close to closing time. So close that we thought for sure we would be turned away. BUT the sweet young lady was more than happy to have us come in! I had never been there so I wasn't really sure what to do except shove all the stuff I liked into a bowl as high as I could make it! Then when I hit the sauce bar I got a glazed look over my eyes and some nice fella just popped up asking if he could be of service. He explained that he was a sauce specialist...we talked about every sauce and he made some recommendations off of the feedback I gave and started spooning stuff into a bowl. We took it to the cook guy and he stirred and sauted my goodies until they were properly cooked and put it back in a bowl. It was really yummy! And I can't wait to go back!!! Get a doggie dish because you will need it!!

I am originally from California (San Francisco) and we have 3 LUsh stores to choose from! I have been a Lush customer since 1994ish. I was sad when I moved because I loved going in and trying stuff out. I was glad though, I could order from the internet. Imagine my delight when I was at the mall and smelled the familiar scent of my favorite place! I was so happy I had tears in my eyes! (okay so maybe it made me a tad home sick...)   I love the bath bombs but I REALLY love the shampoo bars and the bar conditioner! They last a long time and I am always being complimented on how healthy and shiny my hair looks! I am hard on my hair too! But you would never know it! I also am a big fan of the body scrub and moisturizers!  Honestly, it is an addiction for me! But I have to agree it seems like the pricing is really jumping..  Check it out!!! You wont be disappointed!

I will never return to this place! The service was horrible the waitress was beyond rude and when I expressed to her the fact that I had never had such poor service and that I would not be returning she told me that that was fine... She NEVER refilled my ice tea and when she filled my husbands she had an attitude. We went for the Friday fish fry. The family has been going for years. The food was cold when we got it and we had to wait 15 minutes for a fresh plate of fish. I guess that is one way to keep the customers  from eating to much of the all you can eat fish! The place was not busy so I can't place blame on that. She just didn't care!!!

I loved this place and will become a regular! My main girl Amy and I walked in and was seated together right away. I went for the Pedi and a Fill, Benjamin did an amazing job fixing the mess the last place made of my nails. The pedi gal wasn't all that friendly, but benj made up for it. They didn't talk to each other, as other have experienced. The massage was rather soft, but I think my pedi gal had something on her mind, so I am hoping for an improvement the next go around. But overall she did a great job! I have had several compliments on both hands and feet already! The price was really reasonable. And they were fast and efficient!  I would say bring cash for the tip...It is just the polite thing to do. If you charge the tip there is no telling when the tech actually gets it...

Decided to give this place a try and was NOT disappointed!! I had read the reviews about the Italian sub but upon a certain someone's suggestion I tried "The Bomb" it was delicious!!! The chipotle mayo has a hint of kick to it! The sandwich was really flavorful!  The staff was friendly and the owner Doug, made my sandwich personally! When handing me my lunch he took a few minutes out to have a conversation with me. Great touch!!  Will I make the drive over there again? YES!!

I am a HUGE fan of Yogi Grill! Shianne is located at the scottsdale and Shea location and I have to admit I LOVE that she knows my name!! Not because I am there all the time but because she is just really good like that.  Food is priced perfectly!  I have tried several things on the menu - Egg rolls, Pot stickers, teriyaki chicken and beef as well as the tempera. I am not a sushi person and I don't like seaweed! They have a cucumber roll that I add Avocado too and instead of seaweed I get soy paper. It is a buck more I think. But SO WORTH IT!! Oh let's not forget the Avocado salad! YUMMMM  OK so I now go here at least once a week for lunch or dinner and I never tire of it!  Fresh made tasty food that is healthy!

I have a POS Car so I am a frequent visitor at this place. I have to shout out to Moe and to Shon as they have been super heroes in helping me get/keep my car running! They are forever having to run codes on my car because I like to do the work myself but I am not terribly knowledgeable. After reading the codes Shon will go in and research them and print me out the information. When I buy the parts they tell me how to do the work.  EVERYONE is always helpful! These 2 guys always seem to work the shift I shop, so I know them by name~  Sidebar-I had bought a part for a vehicle that I no longer have. I thought I had bought it  at O'Reilly's, turns out I didn't. Moe called the place he thought I may have gotten it at and checked to see what I was up against in making a return on a part I no longer had a receipt for. Then gave me directions to the closest store. That is excellent service in my book!!

This was the worst BK I have ever been too!  I was ignored and the food sat for a long while before the counter person put it on the tray and then had to pack it in a bag because I ordered it to go!  I was so disappointed!

I actually came here because I had purchased a Deal Chicken deal. So glad I did!! The burgers were to die for! The Banana Stand milkshake was tasty and perfect! Peach Lemonade was delish! And the fries...Well they were okay, the boyfriend didn't like that there were so many little pieces versus full fries. And I thought they were a touch to salty, but I would gladly order them again! Everyone was really happy to see us, and serve us! The place is sort of small, but it has a patio with a cooling unit on it. I highly recommend this place!!!

This place was phenomenal!!! The service was outstanding and the food to die for!! We picked it because I wanted a Bloody Mary! It was a great pick! David came to our table to check on us and when we expressed our delight with the food he promptly sent out the chef!  I had the grilled cheese and my man had the chorizo gravy and biscuits. I got not one but two fantastic bacon bloody Mary's and the skinny mojitos were yummy and refreshing!! Can't wait to do Sunday brunch here again!! If you haven't gone you gotta go!!

I don't know if it is because they just opened or what! But this place was a waste of my time and money! We were seated right away and broken chips and excellent salsa were brought out. Everything started out well enough...Drinks and orders taken, drinks brought out in a timely manner...That is where it ended really.  Refills on my soda were slow coming. The guys ordered Beer and we watched the beers hit the bar counter and waited for over 5 mins maybe even a few more before the girl brought them to us. At that point everyone complained they were hot. I thought the food was really good, pricing was okay. One remark was that the shrimp tostada should have avocado on it not an add't 1.50 as a side. The service was really poor. Our orders came out so sporadic we didn't eat as a table. And when asked for the avo, she cleared our table and did other things so that by the time she came back with the avo he was half done with his food making it almost pointless! Had to ask for salsa and chip refills every time.  We started out as a table of 4. Then 2 other peeps came as we were waiting for our tabs. Because we all knew each other they slid another table up to ours and made us a table of 6.  Boy wasn't that convenient for our server who then felt she had the right to add a 15% tip to our tabs. I was shocked when I saw our tab! appalled that she had the huevos to do that! Honestly she forced us to all to over tip her. I saw no excuse for the lousy service we received so I felt she didn't deserve the tip she gave herself! As we are STILL waiting to get the tabs, they brought in a band. All I can say is that they were to many members playing the stage! The music would have been pretty good at a different venue. In a small place like this it was nothing but loud and clangy. I gave two stars for the food and that was it! I do not recommend this place at this time!!

A co worker and fellow Foodie recommended this place when I was asking about wings friday night.   After being seated the waitress gave my son a game tablet that interacted with stuff going on in the restaurant. He was a happy camper while we waited for the food! Bonus because I didn't have to shell out quarters for what I think of as pointless games!   Our Waitress Kat was pretty cool! She was friendly with a little bit of attitude. She took well to the friendly teasing of my boyfriend. She answer our questions and gave her opinion on the flavors we asked about. (I am new to the "Wing" Craze, so I had a few) Kat was on top of her game getting us refills at just the right moment and keeping our table clutter free.   I for one LOVED my wings! I had the Asian Zing, sweet BBQ and Honey BBQ. All three  tasted terrific. I loved the sweet flavor of the chili on the Asian Zing and the BBQ flavors were right on the money! I couldn't finish all of my order so I took it home and I had them the next day. EVEN BETTER!!!!! The heat kicked up a notch sitting over night! But still in the reasonable range for my taste! I tasted my son's burger and it was okay. They have fried pickles which I had been hearing about but never tried...I didn't like them! Personal taste on that one! BUT what I really liked is that the place had a couple of girls walking around giving out samples of the sauces and of the pickles! So it was no big deal that I didn't like the pickles because it didn't cost me anything to try!! I think that is a smart move on BWW's part!  I have to be honest and say that the boyfriend wasn't as excited about his wings as I was mine. But my son devoured the parmesan Garlic wings the next day!  I will be looking to eat at BWW again real soon! Maybe next weekend!!
