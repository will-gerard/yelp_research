Your store employees are pathetic.  Especially that 60-year-old lady who THINKS she is such a snob.  She did a great job making us feel like we were not welcome despite coming to your store numerous times over the last few years.  Please remind that idiot that she works in retail and that guest service is paramount.  There are sooo many people shopping on line these days and she is going to act like that?

I don't get some of the negative reviews here.  I have been there quite a few times when I'm in town and I either order the Prime Rib or the Bone-in Ribeye.  Each and every time, it is out of this world good.  The Aujus with the Prime Rib is the absolute bomb.  The wait staff is really good as well.  I think Cain and Randal were the last 2 guys that served us.  You won't find a more personable wait staff then those guys and they are always on top of it.  Everyone else there is cool as well.  You are greeted by at least 3 passing-by staff member every time.  You just can't get a better happy hour either.  We sat in the bar a couple of times after conferences during the week and have never never been as entertained by any other bar staff.  It's cool laugh with restaurant staff after a week of getting mauled by clients.  And the Happy hour food and drinks are really good as well.    So whatever the problem is, I'm sure they'll fix it.  Don't worry Kincaids, I'll be RIBEYE-HIND-YA ;-)

Came back again for the prime rib and I think it was even better then before.  Hand-down, best prime rib in the valley.

I've lived in CA for over a year now, and let me tell you, I miss this place like no other place in Phoenix.  This place came a long way from it's inception.  This is my first stop when I come to to the PHX.   Nothing beats the Sheppard Pie (George and Dragon used to be my favorite).  The fresh shaved meet, along with the mash potatoes and sauce is the absolute bomb.  The fish and chips are crazy good too, yet I wish it came with a more traditional tartar sauce, eh, 5 STARS ANYWAY!!!  Everything else is pretty damn good too.    Always a great beer and scotch selection as well.  And everything from the company sponsored pub crawls and special event parties are an absolute blast.  I've also noticed that this place gets the hottest girls in town as well.  Always full of ASU or local working business women.  If you are out to seek or just to look at gorgeous women, then this is the place to be.    Unlike many downtown businesses of the like that have tried and went under, this place is still afloat and apparently improving every time.  So I'd really like to see this place continue to succeed.  Never a bad moment, always a great time full of laughter.  I bet they can't wait til the BB KING, comes to town for a little BB Action at the crown ;-)

After growing up in Phoenix with summer times spent in NY, it was refreshing that somebody finally brought real Italian to Central Phoenix.  Over the years, Central Phoenix has become a great place for true Italian food.  There are many great places to choose from with particular items, such as Tutti Santi and L'Amore for the home-made Raviolis, Aiello's for the Gnocci, Gieseppe's for the New York style mom and pop dishes, Spinatos, Cibo and Bianco for their Pizza.  The list goes on and on.  Then came Pizza a Metro.  The 1st time I ate there, I felt like I was back in Trevesio, Italy.  You will not find a better and more traditional, tasty meatball pizza anywhere.  All pastas are home-made daily.  The Lasagna is silky smooth and Canneloni is similar.  The sauces are very traditional in flavor and are perfectly seasoned.  Even the Spaghetti and Meatballs is out of this world good.  The and Puttanesca is completely mouth watering.  The Caesar dressing was not at all creamy, like a real Caesar Dressing.  The Calamari is very lightly breaded and not over-cooked, which is the way it's supposed to be.  You simply will not find any better Truly Authentic Italian Food in Phoenix.  In a nut-shell, This place does everything with perfection.  The only downside is the location and the size.  It would be nice if they were in a place that was at least triple the size (more then 6 tables) and had a decent parking area.  The store and video shop that shares the plaza brings in a lot of weirdos.  There is no where to hang out if you are waiting for a table.  So make sure you get there as early as possible or after lunch.  This place would make a killing if it were closer to light-rail.  I wonder how they would move the most insane Pizza oven in Arizona.

I'm giving you 5 stars because you are the only good restaurant to happen to the AZ Center since Lombardi's closed, which was a smart move by Alberto at the time given the terrible management of the AZ Center.  The movie theater played a big roll in killing the charm of the place as well.  By the way, I worked at Lombardi's as a Server and eventually Bar Manager from 1995 to 2000; therefore, AZ Center HELD a special place in my heart and I will never forget the good times that our staff had.   The AZ Center used to be the biggest downtown Hot Spot in the 1990's.  Whether you were going to a show, a Suns game or what have you, AZ Center used to be the happening spot.  There used to be an fun sports bars, both up and down stairs (Where 1130 and the Collections Agency are now located)  Fat Tuesdays used to be right across from the movie theater.  Gap was where the movie theater is now.  Moon Doggies brought in all the hotties.  Oyster bar used to be upstairs from Hooters.  The place was awesome.  Local Celebrities such as Alice Cooper used entertain us once a week and had his Zuppa Di Pesce.  Jerry Colangelo came in almost every day for lunch to enjoy his Rigatoni A Telefono.  John Hook every other day came in before the news to have his favorite Minestrone.  The list goes on.       So anyway, back to you.  The pizza at Brick are pretty good.  I would not go as far as Cibo or Bianco good, yet, but I really like the creativity of the Pizzas and the flavors of the ingredients.  I've been here 3 times and each time, split a pizza and salad with my girl.  Have not yet tried the pastas.  Salads are well put together and amazing.  There was some in-consistency each time, but never bad.  The ambiance is great and the patio is fun.      Just watching everyone work at the place and how there is actually a sense of professionalism and class with your staff, leads to me to believe that you are going in the right direction.  Don't ever forget that service with a smile, table touching and making sure that everyone passing by your guests are greeting them will take you far.  Eventually, the entire staff will have a swagger to them.  Everything will mesh and gel.       I have been in the shoes of this restaurant.  Initial start-up is not easy.  It really does take a good year for a place to become well established and consistent with EVERYTHING, so give this place a chance because if you want good food from a good Chef at the AZ Center, you will not find it anywhere else there.  With hard work and the support of guests, I can see this place becoming a hit.  We'll definitely be back.
