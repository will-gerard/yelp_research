Before taking your child to this school do some research!! Parents before making a decision please do your research and stay with your child or make surprise visits. I did a surprise visit and what I saw was not what I expected. I don't recommend this daycare at all!

love the lil doggies! I think it's refreshing to have that instead of the usual Hot dogs. Also the toaster is so much better than having a bun for your burgers. Not to mention all of their beverage choices are awesome, the hardest part is choosing a flavor. Love the servers coming out on roller skates, very 1950's lol.

The food is not even that good here, my favorite dish is galbi. For the same price, you can get way better food and service elsewhere.   Service: 2/5 Food: 3/5 Price/Value: 2/5 Ambience: 2/5

I didn't think I would ever review a fast food but this Wendy deserves it! It was the best customer service welcoming second I walked in. I have never been more impressed by a cashier before, and just made everyone she talked with leave in a better mood. The location is great and food was fantastic. Very impressive.

I don't know what Happened to Red Lobster, but it definitely is not the same as it was 20 years ago.   Nothing on the menu looked fresh.  I ordered a lobster soup, and it was way too salty.  Yes, it tasted like frozen salt water seafood.   Not sure why people like this place, I can only assume because it is a seafood restaurant that caters to low class people who do not know the quality seafood..  Will not return again.

The service was incredibly slow and it's for this that it lost a star. Eventually we got a wine list and then it took ages to order our wine and food. There was also a long gap between ordering and getting our food. The staff were very friendly and polite so I definitely wouldn't fault them on that, it was just very slow. The wine was very good. The steak was perfectly cooked for us (rare) and it was incredible. The best steak I've ever had. It was so succulent, tender and tasty. I love pepper sauce on steak but hardly had any on this as it seemed a shame to hide the taste of the actual steak.   This would have been 5 stars without a doubt if the service was quicker.

BIG MISTAKE. I don't know why everyone gives them 5 stars. I think the first time I went there, I thought they were great because of the great service. I thought I had found a great auto mechanic in Ahwatukee.  DEAD WRONG. The 2nd time I went, they cheated me out of $1300. They really do prey on auto inner novices.

I've been here several times and tried different items per visit and none of them were tasty. Seems dirty and staffs here are so rude to customers.  It looked good when it came out.  When I took a few bites of the rib, something tasted not right.  The inside where the rib near the bone area was black.   That night I got so sick, couldn't go to work for 2 days.  Lesson learned:  Never eat something that is not a popular dish at a restaurant or better yet, try not to dine out because you never know what kind of food these people are serving.

I wouldn't eat at this location again. It was majorly disappointing. Food was really not up to par.

This a great Park. One of the best places to take your dogs and they also have a nice kiddie section for the little ones. Plenty of parking, so you can just park right next to the Park. My 2 year old really had a blast in the kids section. There are plenty of swings, so you never have to wait and the slides are pretty awesome. He loved climbing in the slides area...It was hard to get him away from the Park at dusk.  Overall, this is one the nicer parks in the area. Clean and well maintained tracks for walking/jogging and a nice kids section makes it a hit for me. Although this park deserves a 5 stars, I got to give 4 stars because of their restrooms.

I REALLY wanted to like this Korean market since it's the ONLY one in the area... However, I am sadly disappointed. I think this place gets much business since it's the only Korean market in the area.   Unfriendly staff who aren't always there and they're also like robots with no emotions. So unenthusiastic! I wouldn't want these people to be my friends from first impressions. They don't smile or say thank you and I've bought expired food on the shelves and in the fridge section, very bad. One star for some of the good food there I bought in the past. Place is kind of dirty, too.

I'm not expecting quality food here. I mean they have to mass produce if it is 'all you can eat', right? That being said, this place is pretty decent for what it is.   The variety of foods was a pretty good mix of Japanese, Chinese, and American. I can see why people would take kids here that don't particularly have an affinity for Asian food: This place even has a decent selection of seafood.   Won't be a regular, but if I'm ever in the mood for a buffet. I might hit this up again.

I'm the pho specialist. I am so picky when it comes to eating pho at restaurants. In terms of good pho in Chandler, I cannot complain much about this place. I always get a rare beef pho, and it's not bad.. The price is reasonable, service is prompt, and the soup is great. Location is good. Best after hangover. I will definitely be coming back.

I'm not impressed. I came across this restaurant when looking for a restaurant close to my work. This place was not my type. The food was also not good. The only good part about the meal was the coffee. They give you a full pot. I wish we would have gone to the another restaurant. This was restaurant was a bad egg.

reopened a few weeks ago, decent place to go for a good steak dinner. Our server was very active and he exactly knows what he's describing in terms of what we ordered.   The ambience was amazing, drink list was perfect including the wines.

I Ordered the large chicken with a drink for lunch... $7 and some change. Yoshinoya is a totally different dish, so I won't compare... Flame broiler and Waba.... Yeah, those two have nothing on this place... Perfect rice and juicy yet a bit crispy chicken! Love it!

Service sucked. I've been to most chipotles, but this place doesn't put crap in your burrito bowl. I barely had any meat because they there wasn't any left some were being cooked I could've waited instead of giving me a less potion. I get like less of half of the spoon serving. She sprinkled like a pinch a cheese & lettuce. I paid $8 for like half a bowl. Other places I've been to fill up your bowl to the top so you get your money's worth.

Maybe I just need to try other items, but for now I've experienced better rib and briskets in the past..Your order is ready pretty fast since the meats have been barbecued and smoked for hours in advance.  I thought the rib tips were on the dry side and generally not anywhere as good as what I've had.

RUDE, RUDE, RUDE! Just went to the pet club in Ahwatukee and right in the middle of my question the petco staff woman said NO we don't do that and walk away... Yikes, why are you so angry working it a pet store?  Went to the Petco instead and had a wonderful experience.

The perfect scores and reviews don't lie. Absolutely great place both for kids and adults. Both my 7 and 10 yo sons do Tae Kwon Do here. Master Anthony and Master Johnny are absolutely amazing. I've never seen a pair of instructors that can manage children and have so much fun at the same time.  My kids LOVE it!  They have progressed very quickly and we see results not just in their athletic ability, but their manners as well.  They looked like they were having so much fun! It's a great do jang for all ages. Come try an adults class as well, you won't be disappointed.

Great place with great deals. I'v been coming here since it was opened couple years ago. You can find a nice range of stores, from coach, Neiman Marcus, Kate Spade, Tommy, and Polo and many many more. During the holidays you will find great deals.   The food courts are located in the far corner of the outlets, there aren't many. Food options are limited so don't expect too much.   The best time to come here are weekdays, it's difficult to find parking during the weekends. During the holidays it's pretty much busy at all times with a lot of tourists and locals trying to Christmas shop.

This is a hidden gem in Arizona. Things are off to a great start when we tried out the ban chan. The HyeJang Soup and Bibim Nengmyun are my favorites.   The soup is a vibrant, spicy red -- thickened by the long-stewed and bits of meat that have fallen off the bone. The meat have generous portions of tender that just slide off. The spices are accentuated by just the right amount of fat from the meat.
