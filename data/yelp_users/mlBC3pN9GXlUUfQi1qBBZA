I am pretty sure this is the best bakery in AZ. I am pleased to say that Barb's did my wedding cake almost 7 years ago and it was absolutely amazing. Still hear compliments to this day about that cake! We ordered two different flavors: The white cake with strawberry champaign filling and the red velvet, both with buttercream frosting. Both were off the hook! Not only that, the owner was a complete doll and very helpful in designing the wedding cake. Delivery and set up were also provided and in the end, the cake looked beautiful.  One additional tip: If you order a wedding cake from Barbs, they will give you a free small cake on your one year anniversary so you dont have to eat horrible freezer burned cake! I wasnt sure how easy it would be to take them up on this but all I did was call, choose a flavor, and they had my cake waiting for me the next day. The cherry on top was that rather than it being just a standard plain sheet cake, they decorated it as well!!! If you are looking for terrific customer service and good prices to go along with your cake, Barbs is your place!

Alright, here is the review that I have been vowing to do but kept putting off. I am bound to offend some of you "Chain restaurant" haters but here goes...  Olive Garden has become the brunt of many jokes over the years and even had a clever and hilarious skit done on Mad TV years ago. The main complaint I have heard time and time again is that the food is not "authentic." No comments about the food being bad or bland, just that its not "authentic." Ok I will agree that the food may not be "authentic" from my perspective of what Italian food should be. My grandfather was 100% Italian and I ate much of his Italian food growing up. That is what I consider "authentic" Italian food to be. Here's the thing though... I have never been to Italy and I am sure that most of the people complaining about OG's authenticity havn't been either. So who are we to know that its not authentic in some area of Italy? I am fairly sure its not and you can bet that when I do visit Italy inside and out (which will hopefully be in the next year), I will be yelping another review on the OG just to say if it is indeed "authentic." One thing I can vouch for with Olive Garden is that most of the items I have tried there are delicious and their bread-sticks are like crack! Sure sure, laugh and knock me as much as you want but I know that everyone that has had OG likes at least one thing. You can slam OG but you have either liked their bread-sticks, soup, salad, or some kind of entree. Anyways, to address the point I am trying to make: a good restaurant (chain or not) should have good food and I can say that Olive Garden does have good food. Their soups are delicious (try the chicken gnocchi or the zuppa Tuscana), the bread-sticks are light, airy and buttery with the right amount of garlic flavor, and although the salad is nothing special vegi wise, the dressing is one of the better Italian dressings out there and is very refreshing. For entrees, they make the one of the best eggplant Parmesans and fettuccine Alfredos I have ever had, the stuffed chicken Marsala is unique but delicious, and their seafood portifino is rich and creamy with a generous amount of perfectly cooked seafood. The desserts are equally as delicious, my favs being the apple crostada and the black tie mousse cake.  The service has always been decent although you may get an occasional slow waiter. However, I can say that most times I walk away satisfied with the overall experience. The price and value is terrific too. Come on, how many other "Italian" places you know of where you can get bread, salad/ soup, and big bowl of pasta for less then 15.00? Not very many, that's for sure! My only complaints: Too family friendly and sometimes there are screaming kids, however, with a few bowls of  delicious soup and pasta, I can sometimes manage to drown it out. Also, years ago, I ordered nothing but their cannelloni al forno (pasta tubes filled with meat and topped with cheese, Alfredo and marinara sauce). My precious dish was taken away from me and replaced with "three meat ravioli" which was close so I kept getting that. Then that was removed from the menu. I started getting "classics" after that that I was sure would not be removed from the menu like eggplant parm. But for dessert, I fell in love with their chocolate molten cake with vanilla cream and strawberries. Guess what happened? Yep, it was taken away from me  :(  I have also heard numerous complaints about how a special one month will be terrific but a month later, its no longer available and is never to be seen again. I wish the OG would stop replacing good meal items and also bring back some of the popular past specials so people can enjoy them again. I also wish that one of those specials will be the cannalloni al forno. If that was the case, I would go there for a month straight and order it. OG, stop changing out good menu items. After all, if it aint broke, don't fix it!

Ive been to Texass Roadhouse numerous times now and have really not been impressed. The rolls are good but I personally think that Logans Roadhouse has better ones (Logans are always soft and never overbaked, Texas's have been the last few times). Am I the only one that has noticed though that almost everything is wayyyy too salty? Every time I order fries here, they are doused in salt. The husband got the chicken fried sirloin last night with fries and both were super salty. The green beans have boatloads of salt too. Additionally, the ranch dressing tastes like crappy bottled Kraft dressing. One final thing that was a no go for me is that their fresh steamed vegis were terrible. Last night, their broccoli was not trimmed enough the ends of it were very hard and fibrous and the carrots were not cooked enough so they were still hard. Booooo. I am not a fan of vegis as it is but when eaten this way, I really despise them. Now what has been good is their chili although it is a bit rich. Its very meaty so if I ever have to go here (with a group of people, I wont come here on my own), I would just get a bowl of this and have some rolls. The husband also says that the ribs are great. They are always fall of the bone tender. Aside from that, we are unimpressed with everything else. One other thing is that their portions are fairly large. However, the food, as mentioned is kinda crappy so if you like eating lots of crappy uninspired food, this is your place. I have nothing against chain restaurants but this is one of those that I don't get what the hype is about (see my list of overhyped places). This place is always busy and the wait is at least an hour each time I have been to this location. They don't take reservations or call ahead. I would advise to try Logans instead. Not only do they have better rolls but their menu is better and has more selections. Logan's food is always better as well and they have sweet potato fries which is one of my weaknesses. Also, their wait is never bad. Sorry Texass but in my opinion, you kinda suck.  PS: If you hate kids, DO NOT COME HERE. They are everywhere! The staff also seems to have a hard time accommodating large groups and there is not enough space in the area where they pile the large groups. You literally cannot move and the waiters have a hard time getting around the tables.

First reviewer was correct about the pricing. A little overpriced. But by far the best bagels I have ever had. The plain, honey wheat, onion, asiago, and potato bagels are awesome and I love the Onion and chive cream cheese. I have never had a bagel so soft anywhere else. Their tasty turkey sammich is good too along with their potato salad.

Tried the 6 cheese bagel. My gawd it was cheesy! Also tried the BLTA on bagel thin and it was pretty good. I love the sauce on it. What I really wanted to update everyone on is that they have a good deal on soup. You can get a cup of soup that is pretty large for 3.95 and it comes with a bagel of your choice. I think thats a pretty good deal. Soups vary day to day... The cheesy broccoli was what I tried and although I wasn't a big fan of it, its still a a great value if you can find a good soup.

I was turned on to Neds when I was in High School and am a fan. Its a good value. I believe the last time I went, an 8: sub with side and drink was like 5.00. Wayyy better than subway. I like just the traditional turkey sammich with lettuce, tomato, onion and lots of mayo. The reason they are not rated "as good as it gets" is because every time I have gone there, there is not enough mayo on the sammich. Make sure you ask for extra unless you want a dry sub. Their potato salad is terrific and might be the best I have ever had. The service is quick and friendly and the facility is clean but a bit plain. Give it a try if your looking for a new sammich spot.   PS: Their catering is great too. They always include everything and instead of giving little packets of mayo, mustard, oil, vinigar, they give you actual bottles.   :O

Thanksgiving happens to be my favorite holiday! But here is the problem with that... its once a year. I crave turkey and all the fixins alot more then once a year but there is no way in hell I am going to cook all of that. So that is where Boston Market comes into play.  Boston Market has all the home cooked goodness of Thanksgiving but they serve individual meals so I can get that wonderful Thanksgiving comfort food experience at a fraction of the price. VICTORY!  Their turkey and chicken are delicious but just like Thanksgiving day, what really stand out for me are the sides. I don't think I have had one thing at Boston Market that I didnt like. Among my favorites are the creamed spinich, mac and cheese, veggie stuffing, sweet potato casserole, and corn bread.  Yes their prices are a bit higher then KFC but the quality and taste of their food is in on a whole other level. Also the service is always fast and friendly.  If you love Thanksgiving and want to taste it, go to Boston Market today!

Decided to try a new place one Friday night. Remembered Pesto's from my High School days at Chandler High when we went there for lunch. Back then, it was a little hole in the wall and had a counter you walked up to to order. I was surprised because now the restaurant is contemporary and a sit down restaurant. The decor inside is gorgeous yet, the place is still small giving it an intimate feel. I loved the wine wall and the beading separating the bar from the actual restaurant.  Anyhoo, my husband and I opted for the appetizer sampler plate which came with stuffed mushrooms, eggplant bruschetta, and fried ravioli. The mushrooms were ok (Ive had better, Haus Murphy's has the best!), the ravioli were great but I prefer mine with meat, and the eggplant bruschetta was pretty good though different from your standard bruschetta. I could have done without the kalamata olives which I think are a bit too salty. For our meals, I got the spaghetti and meatballs with extra meatball and my husband got the meat calzone with sausage and pepperoni. I loved the spaghetti and meatballs! The meatballs were flavorful, big and meaty, and soft the way a meatball should be. I probably didn't even need to get extra because they were huge but I am glad I did since they were so yummy. I never thought I would say this but they might be as good if not better than Rigatony's meatballs. The hub said his calzone was good but it didn't seem that fresh. The cheese was not oozing from it like it would with one that just came out of the oven.  I am a total canoli connoisseur so I felt that it was my duty to try one at Pesto's. Boy am I glad I did because this was one of the best canoli's I think i have ever had! It had chocolate chips in it but what really kicked it up a notch was that it had salted pistachio's on it which gave it the sweet and salty effect. It was lovely! I probably should have gotten the mini canoli but I am kinda glad I got the big one. GO BIG OR GO HOME! Anyways, Pesto's was pretty good although the service was a little slow. I was surprised that there was no wait on a Friday night at 6 and there were still tables open. I hope this place doesn't go under cause where will I go to get a canoli fix??? WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!

I have been eating at China Way since I was in high school (that was 10 years ago and it has been consistently good. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here. To look at the building, its not much but the family that runs it is super nice and the food is amazing. There is only one thing I order because it is so good that I can't bring myself to order anything else. The General Tsao's chicken combo with fried rice, egg roll, and crab puff. Everything included in this combo is excellent and they have probably the best sweet and sour sauce I have ever had. To me, Chinese food doesn't get any better than this!

I absolutely love Mimi's for breakfast! So lemme clarify with the star rating: breakfast/ brunch = 4 stars. Lunch and dinner = 3 stars. Their breakfast menu has so many lovely choices and pictures. K so here is what I have had:  Breakfast: Eggs benedict - Very good but a bit too much ham on it. Got to a point where ham was all I could taste Eggs florentine - AMAZING! One of the best benedicts I have ever had! Eggs are always cooked perfect, hollendaise is light and creamy, and I love the mixture of the tomato, bacon, and spinich. This is what I order most of the time. Used to get the eggs houssard which was the best but they did away with it which always happens to me! Crabcake benedict - Good but the crabcakes can get a bit overpowering and they turn this breakfast into a very heavy one. Mixed Berry Pain Perdu - Great for if you have a sweet tooth. They give you tons though and after awhile, its a bit too sweet at least for me. Still liked it alot though. Chipotle Breakfast Burrito - This is surprisingly very good considering its not from a mexican restaurant. Ciabatta Breakfast sammich - Very good but a bit too much meat for my liking. I think I will order it minus the ham next time. But the rest of it taste terrific. Quiche - Have had a couple different types (brocolli and cheese, crab and sweet corn) and I can say that Mimi's makes some of the best quiche I have ever had. Very light and flaky crust with fluffy eggs and great mixins Carrot Bread/ Blue Berry muffins - Some of the best bread and muffins I have ever had. Always warm and fresh Redskin Breakfast potatoes - Pretty good. I prefer greasy hashbrowns though  Lunch/ Dinner: French onion soup - Good soup. Better be good cause this is one of the things I think they are supposed to be known for. Chicken fettuccine - Was ok, not very memorable though. I liked that it had artichokes and sundried tomatoes but the sauce wasnt very thick and the chicken was kinda bland. Butternut Squash Ravioli with scallops - This was a special at one point and it was very good. The scallops didnt taste frozen like they do at most AZ restaurants and the ravioli were very light and flavorful. Unfortunately, I am not sure if or when this special will come back  So to sum it up, I am always excited to go to Mimi's for breakfast, however, I don't often consider going there for dinner. I feel that I should go and try more items for dinner/ lunch because the items I have had during those times were not bad. There is definately potential. The prices are reasonable and the service is good most of the time. Oh and I definately need to go back and try their bread pudding at some point to see if it makes the list of best bread puddings.   :)

World Market has been a huge blessing while shopping for Christmas. I forgot how much I loved this store. When shopping for a gift, you are a bound to find something for everyone at World Market. This store has so many cute and unique items that you can't find anywhere else (except for maybe online). Its the perfect place for the world traveler, home cook, wine enthusiast, and for many other hobbies. There are many other novelties that are available such as bath and body items, candles, specialty foods from around the world, candy, reading material, etc. A few of my favorite recent purchases:  Beer from around the world case (has 10 different beers each from other countries), a packing list tablet (checklist of items to pack when going on vacation), Moist towelette wipes that have pets dressed as certain celebrity's on the front (the Snoop Dog one is the best), Liquor filled chocolates, and mini hot sauces (you never know when you will need some hot sauce!). After shopping at World Market, I have so many ideas now for the holidays and for future gifts. Another great thing about shopping here is that the pricing is decent too. Nothing is overly expensive and all is within reason. Additionally, the cashiers are always super polite and friendly and the store is well organized and clean. Since Christmas is fast approaching, add World Market to your lists of places to shop if you are still questioning gifts for certain people.

Screaming kids and frozen seafood. That is about all this place had to offer. After years of not going to Red Lobster, I decided to try it again for their "crabfest" special. Unfortunately, I was reminded of why I quit going here. Upon arriving, we were greeted by a large party with mainly young kids that were screaming and being abnoxious. UNCLE RANDY!!!! God you would think they hadn't seen their uncle, well, ever! Anyways, we were finally seated, unfortunately, not nearly far enough away from the hoards of screaming kids and babies. My husband and I do not have kids nor do we want them. We love to be able to go out to dinner but its gotten to the point where most restaurants are "family friendly" which usually entails jerk kids and parents that have learned to tune them out. Quite irritating and inconsiderate actually.  In any event, I opted for the crab trio which came with king crab legs, snow crab legs, and crab stuffed shrimp. I ordered the creamy lobster mashed potatoes and a cup of the clam chowder. The hub ordered the shrimp trio which came with two types of shrimp (can't remember what they were but when i asked the hub, he stated "sh*t, mostly just sh*t.") and schrimp pasta. He officially hates Red Lobster if you couldnt tell. Both him and I agreed that most of our food tasted as if it was frozen and from a bag. The clam chowder tasted canned. The cheesy sauce on my potatoes along with my shrimp tasted fowl and almost had a chemical taste to it. And most importantly, the biscuits which we had looked forward so much to were overcooked and dry. These used to be the best part of the meal but they have really gone downhill. Actually the restaurant in general has gone downhill.  The service was ok but I have one complaint. Although they give you crab crackers, they don't give you the other little gadget that you use to tear the crab so its easier to open. This would have helped alot when I was eating my king crab legs considering that they are thorny and sharp. Not worth cutting up my petite cute little hands to get a little bit of crab meat. Haha. To wrap it up, we will never go back unless we have company and they want to go there. Then I guess we would have to find something to choke down. It sucks because we used to love Red Lobster when they first came out but the quality of, well, everything has gone down throughout the years. The price however, I am fairly certain has gone up. If I am going to pay nearly $40 for a meal, I expect it to be fresh and magnificent, and I expect to not see a misbehaved child in sight. I am not normally a fan of more upscale restaurants but I think i might be giving more of those types of places a try after eating at Red Lobster.

I will admit it! I have an unhealthy obsession with the Cheesecake Factory. Yes yes, this is a chain, I know. But honestly, I don't give a flying f*** if its a chain or an independent restaurant owned by some cute little family down the road. As long as the food is delicious and plentiful, the service fast and friendly, the cost is palatable,  and the atmosphere clean and pleasant, I will be a fan of any place. After all, isn't that what writing reviews and being a foodie is about? I come to Cheesecake Factory often and I can't think of a time when I had a non pleasant experience. Yes, there have been a couple of waiters that are a bit slower then others and some of the dishes were not as good as others, but I can always say that Cheesecake Fac is a safe bet if you want a nice meal that will fill you up along with decent service.  If you have ever been to the Cheesecake Factory, you know about their menu. It is literally a book! They pride themselves in having something for everyone so there are tons of items to choose from. Here are a few of my suggestions of what to order so you don't go wrong:   Appetizers: - Sweet corn tamale cakes - Fried chicken sliders - Avocado Eggrolls - Fried Zucinni small plate - Their small plates actually have alot. They are like the size of a normal appetizer that is not on steroids - Clam chowder or creamy chicken and artichoke soup - Believe it or not, their clam chowder is the best I have ever had  Entrees: - Chicken Costelleta - Chicken Chipotle Pasta - BBQ Ranch chicken salad - Salisbury chopped steak - Crispy spicy beef - Bang bang chicken and shrimp - Only order this if you like Indian spice flavors  Keep in mind that everything is massive in size so in my opinion, the prices are pretty decent for the amount of food you get. You could share one entree with another person and get an appetizer and be stuffed yet not spend alot. Now I will admit that there were some things I had at the CC Factory that were not that great. The crabcake burger is too greasy and overpowering, and their mac and cheese balls are nothing impressive. But the good far outweigh the bad and there definitely is something for everyone. Heck, if anything, there is always the cheesecake which they have in every flavor imaginable. Try the dutch apple or carrot, these are my favorites!

It's been far too long since I have been here which is sad because its probably one of my faves for chili rellenos. I always get the shredded beef rellenos with the cheese sauce and double papa's and it is lovely! Their chips are also nice and crispy and their salsa has a different roasted flavor to it which is really good. Unfortunately, the husband is not a fan because he says its not very authentic. Authentic or not, its awesome!!! The prices are good, portions huge, and the service had almost always been stellar. The only thing I would advise against though would be getting the taco's. The shells are literally the kind you would buy in a box at the store. Other than that, this place is great!

I have recently fallen in love with their spinach enchiladas with queso sauce. Seriously, the best spinach enchilada I have ever had. Because of this, I have determined I like Abuelos even more and upped their score to 5 stars. Also, I have never had bad service here and the atmosphere is beautiful.

Ok so I will be honest, I have never tried the pizza here. I know I know, how can I go to a pizza place and not get the pizza??? Three words: Barbecue chicken salad!!! I made the mistake of trying this salad the first time I came and have not been able to get away from it since. Its all I order! I get mine with avocado, you should do it too. You will not be sorry.  I know people who have tried their pizza and say its pretty good. I do like the fact that they have whole wheat crust so if my salad ever gets taken off the menu (which is known to happen to me), then I may try their pizza with the whole wheat crust. Oh we had them cater a lunch at work and they were pleasant to deal with and made sure we had everything we ordered and needed. Did get to try their chicken salad sammich on foccacia and that was very tasty as well. This is by far one of the better chains out there currently. You must go here and try their BBQ chicken salad, you will be a fan for life! Just don't expect it to help you lose weight   ;)

I have never had a bad meal at Z Tejas. Yes, its a little pricier then other mexican/ southwest places, but the quality of food makes it worth it. The free cornbread they start you out with is by far the best corn bread I have ever had. I love their Tejas Trio which is chips with salsa, handhacked guac, and queso. The amount you get of each dip is plentiful and this seems more worth it then just getting the tableside guac for the same price. For meals, my husband and I both love the chorizo stuffed pork tenderloin. It is amazing!!! Also delicious is the artichoke mushroom chicken stack. Their salads are very good and I can't get anough of the fry bread croutons they put on the salad. For dessert, I have only tried their seasonal cobbler and it was terrific. I have had it with apple and with peach. I havn't  been to Z Tejas in awhile and it makes me sad cause I really loves it. The service is always great, the atmosphere is beautiful and romantic and of course the food is unbelievable. Quick tip: Try coming here for dinner as there are more choices then what is on the lunch menu. I cant get the pork tenderloin during lunch and it makes me wanna cry   :(

Went here a few weeks ago for brunch. I will say that I am still a fan of Z Tejas but I think I just ordered the wrong thing. I had the potato hash and eggs which was ok but it seemed like it needed something more flavor wise. Maybe a little more sauce on top would have made it better. Also, since I was sick, I ordered the tortilla soup. It was a thick soup and I actually prefer brothier tortilla soups. Wasn't bad though. As always, the cornbread was phenomenal. I also had a red sangria and it was delicious and refreshing. My companion said that she loved her burger and fries. I still love Z Tejas but I will probably just go for dinner there from here on out since that is where they really shine.

Sooooo good!!!! Way better than Auntie Anns although Auntie Anns is not bad. I love the plain pretzel (butter but no salt) with cheese. Sooo much butter and cooked to perfection at Wetzels. I watched the girl making them too and she was a pro! The hubby and I can't help but to get one of these when we are wandering around the Chandler Mall which is usually after having dinner at a place in or around the mall and going to see the puppies at puppies of love. That tells you how much we love these pretzels. We are usually already full but we have to get one anyways!!! My new motto: "There is always room for a pretzel!"  The only thing I have noticed is that these are a bit slow. Not sure why when they have everything already made and all they have to do is grab it and give it to you.... hmmm

First time visiting BJs last night and I thoroughly enjoyed what I ordered: BBQ Ranch chicken salad with avocado added. The salad was fricken huge and I loved the crispy onions on top. It was cold and refreshing and divine! Hubby got the California burger and said it was ok. All in all, a decent place but was a bit pricey. 12.00 for my salad and 10.00 for his burger that wasn't very big. Strawberry lemonade was ok but Chili's has better. Pizookie was good but they are easy to make at home, not worth it to pay for one here. Service was good although my avocado was initially left off my salad. Would I go back? Yes I would but not often since its kinda pricey for what it is. Would get the salad again, maybe try their pizza, and some of their brews.

Came here on my birthday and was not impressed. The atmosphere was nice but my husband and I were not happy with the food at all. The bread they gave pre-meal was just ok but didn't seem very fresh. There were two types of butter that came along with the bread and both were actually pretty good. I ordered the lobster bisque to start and honestly, the flavor was a bit odd. I personally think the lobster bisque at Red Lobster is better not to mention cheaper. For dinner, I ordered the seared scallops that came on top of puff pastry and a measly portion of vegetables. The scallops were gritty and seemed like they had not been cleaned properly as I could taste granules of sand. My husband ordered the ribeye since Flemings is supposed to be known for their steak. He said that the steak was not seasoned at all. For sides, we ordered the Flemings potatoes which were really good and the baked potato which was fine, but honestly, how hard is it to mess up baked potato? When the check was presented they also gave me a box of chocolate truffles since it was my birthday. I wont lie, these were amazing!!! Unfortunately, the truffles, Flemings potatoes, and butter will not make me come back. I am all about giving places several tries before deciding to go back but not a place with a huge price tag such as Flemings. When I spend $100 on a dinner for two, I expect everything to be sensational and Flemings was very far from it.  PS: The husband said it was the worst steak ever and you would be better to light your money on fire rather then spending it here. :)

I love Pei Wei!!! The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is that I think I love China Way (see my other review) more and its more authentic I believe. Everytime I have been to Pei wei though, I have not be disapointed. I have several favs. The honey seared chicken is amazing, as are the Pei Wei spicy beef, lettuce wraps, and Dan Dan noodles. The orange beef , pad thai, and chicken lo mein are pretty good as well but I rarely order them because I love the other dishes more. I love that you can order noodles with your entrees in place of the rice but having the option of brown rice is nice as well when I am trying to watch what I eat. Another tip if you are watching calories: you can get any main dish with the chicken steamed instead of battered and fried. Pei Wei also makes the most amazing crab wontons with the best sauce evar!!! One of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to crab wontons is when there is no crab. Hello, crab is in the name so it should be present in the dish! At Pei Wei, you can actually taste and see the crab in their wontons. Mix that with the sweet chili sauce they serve the wontons on and these are great! Don't get me wrong though, I've tried some of their other dishes that I was not a big fan of. Their thai coconut chicken was a little bland, the sweet and sour chicken is not what I look for in sweet and sour chicken (the sauce wasnt very strong), and the mongollian chicken had a strange flavor that I didnt care for. But to each his own, people have different taste. Anyways, Pei Wei is one of my favorite places to go and the prices are relatively cheap. I agree with one reviewer in why would you go to PF Changs when Pei Wei has the same food pretty much at a fraction of the price not to mention the portions are bigger.

This place is definately a dive! Its small, run down, dated, and unclean. Ive been twice now, and both times were not by choice. Both times, my water glass had nasty stuff on the outside and inside. Very disgusting. Their tacos are puny, expensive and flavorless. Their guacamole just tasted weird almost like there was too much lime juice in it. Oh and those pictures that are posted on here are not accurate examples of what you get from LuLu's. Everything is tiny and doesnt have much color. This place does not impress me whatsoever and I about cry each time someone suggest that we go   :(

Have been here many times for lunch and everything I have had has been pretty good. Here is what I have tried:  Sammiches: Arizona Sky Pressed Sandwich - Really good Caprese - Love this sammich. The Balsamic makes it! Maiden Lane - Another fave next to the Caprese.  Picnic - Good but needed more apple and carmelized pecans. Gorganzola was a bit overpowering Farmer - Probably my least favorite. Was good but the sweet potatoes needed to be cooked more (they were hard). The goat cheese was awesome on this sammich though Liberty grilled cheese with tomato - By far the best grilled cheese I have ever had  Sides: Roasted Sweet Potato salad - Different but very tasty Grilled vegi medley (special) - Really flavorful for being just vegetables Creamy Potato Salad - I didn't care for it. Its more of a dill potato salad. I prefer potato salads that have sweet pickle in them.  Dessert Case: Bread Pudding - 2nd best bread pudding I have ever had. Charlestons has the best   :) Blueberry Scone - Not usually a fan of scones but this was really good and the home made whipped cream was wonderful Salt River bar - Was ok but I don't think I would get again. I thought it would be sweeter but it really wasn't. A little too salty in some area's  All in all, Liberty Market is pretty legit. I really like their sammiches and have never had anything like their roasted sweet potato salad. The atmosphere is really cute. The service can be a little slow at times but all the employees seem really friendly.

Have tried the chicken sandwich recently and absolutely loved it. It really is the best chicken sandwich. I love the vinegar sauce that is on it!!!

Tried the white pizza recently and it was very very tasty. Thin crust, white sauce, bacon, pine nuts, and arugula. The pine nuts could be left off as I didn't feel they did much for the flavor. All in all, very good pizza. One more thing to decide amongst when coming here...

Pretty much my favorite place for breakfast in AZ. I always get the #10 omelet (bacon, potato, green onion, sour cream, and cheese) with no potato add avocado. Sooooo gooooood. This is one of the few places I order omelets because they are really good. The omelets are always light and fluffy, their home fries are really good and different from any others I have had, and their toast is amazing. They toast a french wheat baquette which takes toast to a whole other level! The husband usually gets the green chili pork omelet which is a special on the weekends. He absolutely loves it and I will admit that it is pretty dam tasty! Other things we have tried: cinnamon roll was huge and lovely, chicken fried steak and eggs which is a special on the weekend, and biscuits and gravy which is huge and the gravy definately taste homeade. The prices are good and the service is always good with a really friendly staff. I never have to wait for my drink to be refilled and the food comes out pretty quick. The only thing you will be waiting for is a table. Unfortunately, this place has a huge following of people that love it but the restaurant itself is tiny. Ive seen master bedrooms larger than this place!!! Expect to wait at least a half hour if you come here during normal breakfast hours. Ive noticed if you sleep a little later though and come around 11:30 or 12, its not nearly as crowded. Also, this place does not have indoor waiting. You put your name on a list outside and you wait outside. There is shade but during the summer months, it obviously gets hot. So be prepared for that. If you can handle the wait, you will definately agree that this place is the best little diner for breakfast in AZ!

Chili verde birdie all the way!!! Make sure to add avocado. The bread is fresh and wonderful. Sweet potato fries are pretty good though not the best I have had. I have had the "we must meat, I aint lion" and it was ok. I think I am just not a big fan of steak sammiches (unless they are like phily cheesesteaks) and gorganzola cheese. The prices are good and the service has always been decent. The biggest problem is that when you come during lunch hours, the place is packed and they don't seem to know how to estimate wait times. We were told 15 min one time and were stuck waiting for over a half hour. Overall, a very good place to eat. Guy should pay a visit here.

Had their jalapeno cheese mashed potato pie. Tasty and spicy but very small. Pretty much like a small potato pancake. Get the sweet potato fries instead of your side. They are delectable!

Side salad is great. Love the addition of the garbonzo beans. They also have a terrific balsamic dressing. Their cobbler is pretty good, love the crunchy topping, however, was not a fan of the filling that day. I think it an apple rhubarb. Not much of a fan of rhubarb. Make sure you ask what flavor the cobbler is if you are planning on ordering it.

I love this place!!! A variety box of brownies was given to my company as a gift for Christmas. I tried the double chocolate and was immediately hooked. I managed to cut myself off though and bring half of the brownie home to my hubby. He absolutely loved it! That is saying a lot as he is very picky when it comes to his brownies. He didn't even like Fairytale brownies and I will admit, Fairytale has nothing on The Brownie Connection. I bought him 3 more a couple weeks later and he devoured them saying each time that he was pretty sure its the best brownie evar! I love how cute and small this place is and the mother daughter team that owns it are very sweet and friendly. A little pricey for a brownie as most of these bakery's are. However, I will splurge on occasion for my hubby since he loves them and I concur with him that they are great.  Update: OMG, just read on their website that the team that owns this place is retiring. There is no where to even shop on their website. I think they may no longer be in business. I am completely devastated! Just when I became a fan too!

I can't believe I never did a review on this place. I had such high hopes and my hopes were crushed after eating here for the first time. The restaurant looks really pretty from the outside. However, upon entering, the atmosphere is really old and dated. They definitely need to put in new carpet and make a few other updates. We were sat fairly close to a drink dispenser that had broke and was making a horrible noise as workers scrambled to get it under control. In any event, I opted to order the cannelloni (one of my favorite Italian dishes if made right, I will order it if its on the menu) and the hubby ordered the chicken marsala with a side of fettuccine alfredo. We both had a salad with their house Italian dressing. From what I can remember, the bread was simply ok, didn't taste fresh baked by any means. Oh we did order the bruschetta before dinner and it was actually very good, one of the better bruschetta's Ive had. Our meal was a different story. The salad was ok, a decent mix of greens with vegetables, however, I didn't care for the dressing. I am not a huge fan of Italian dressing and prefer ranch. I believe their salad came standard with the Italian dressing though. The hubbys marsala came and was very puny and the alfredo was not that great. In our opinion, it takes a serious talent to make good alfredo sauce that is the perfect consistency and thickness and this was too runny for his liking. My cannelloni was drowned a rose sauce and was nothing memorable. It also was not that big of a portion. Service was decent from what I remember though. All in all, I am not sure why this place gets so much praise. It was simply ok in my book although a little run down and old. Would I go here again? Maybe if someone else wanted to go. Otherwise, I will not waste my time and stick to truly good Italian food at Rigatonies. Now that is my kind of place!

My dad and I went and saw Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and it was amazing. This was actually my first time at the IMAX to see a movie and after seeing an action movie on that huge clear screen, I am thinking this is the only place I will see another action movie (with the exception of my home TV). Seeing a movie at the IMAX is a completely different experience and I feel it was worth the extra money for the better view, clearer picture and sound, and an overall cleanlier movie theater. The downsides: Only one movie is played at a time so there really aren't any choices, the food and popcorn are still expensive, the movie is expensive (15.00, I could wait and buy the fricken movie when it comes out on DVD/ Blue-ray), and student discounts are not accepted. However, for the occasional high octane action movie, this is worth the splurge.

I went to Bosa yesterday and to be honest, I am pretty dam torn. I believe I do like Krispy Kremes yeast doughnuts better though. Bosa's yeast doughnuts although fluffier and larger, are simply not as light and airy as Krispy Kremes yeast doughnuts. I feel like I can eat a ton of doughnuts at Krispy Kreme since they are so light. Bosa's were not bad though and reminded me of Dunkin Doughnuts. Its really just personal preference. However, Bosa does have absolutely amazing, moist cake doughtnuts. I tried the chocolate coconut one and was amazed at how good it was considering cake doughnuts usually are dry and not that great. Would I go back? If I was in the area and craving a doughnut, for sure!

Can you say awesome beans and rice, wonderful hot sauce, and lots of mormons?!?  Normally, I would never eat at a place that looks the way El Charro does on the outside and on the inside. But ever since trying to impress an ex boyfriends parents by eating there with them, I have been a fan and can now zone out the atmosphere.  They have really good bean burrito's and tacos, but what I really go there for is the rice and beans which are usually mediocre and are simply there in case you need a little somethin more at other restaurants. I can't describe what makes them so great at El Charro but they just are! The beans are the perfect consistency (not too runny, not too thick) and the rice has great flavor and big chunks of tomato and onion.  Also worth of a shoutout are the salsa (chunky with really good flavor) and the macaroni salad that you can get with certain meals (its home made I believe).  Downsides are that they charge you for more than one bowl of chips and salsa sometimes (I think if you are on their good side, they will not charge you), and their chili rellenos suck!!! Whatever you do, don't order them. I guess the inside and outside of the building could use some spucing up as well.  This place is an institution in AZ and in our family.

Just a little tip I had forgotten to mention: El Charro closes for several months during the summer. So if you are planning on going during the summer months, you might want to call and make sure they are open....

I went to this place once but I loved it!!! I love to eat and eating is what you do a lot of at this place! The entire meal was great: Ham, chicken and stuffing, ribs, coleslaw, green beans, baked beans, rolls and raisin bread, and cookies! The only thing I didn't care for was the prickly pear jelly they give you for the bread. My husband loves it though.  I love the theme of this place and eating off the metal dishes was pretty fun. The only thing that was odd is that they say you should make a reservation. I made a reservation for a Saturday night at 7. When my party and I showed up, we were surprised to find the dining room empty. Why did I need a reservation again???  Anyways, Mining camp is a great family restaurant and a great place to go if you are looking for something different and for all you can eat!

I noticed the big "closed" next to the name on this place. It is not closed permanently, they just close for certain seasons/ months. I believe they are currently open... Go to their website to confirm if this is a place you would like to visit...

I have been here twice now, both times sitting inside. I need to see what their patio looks like though since everyone has been going on about it. In any event, I have enjoyed the food very much both times. The first time, I had the ahi tuna tacos and they were very tasty and I actually felt like I was eating something good for me which is rare when eating Mexican food. The second time, I ordered the vegetarian torta. Never having a torta before, I wasnt sure what to expect but after having it at El Zocalo, I will be having it more often. The bread was delicious, soft and warm. Even though there was no meat, there was plenty of avocado which made it filling. Their black beans are pretty good and their rice has a unique flavor to it which I enjoyed. Chips and salsa are great as well. I love the flavor of their salsa with just the right amount of kick. Also, the chips are made fresh and you can tell they are tortilla that has been deep fried in house. The service was great both times. My only complaints are that the prices are a bit higher than most other Mexican places, they make their drinks pretty strong (I am a wimp when it comes to strong drinks), and their bean dip was simply ok. It was good when you mixed it with salsa but if you didnt have salsa, it would need something more. In any event, this is a place I would return to if I was looking for light Mexican food though not often because of the price.

Gosh, where do I start.... went for breakfast yesterday and was excited to try Brunchies as I had been hearing about it for years. I love Serrano's so I figured that this place was going to be good as well. Not even close to being like Serrano's. First off, you can definitely tell that Brunchies takes a back seat to Serrano's in the owners eyes. My first impression was not a good one based on the atmosphere and cleanliness of the restaurant and the service from the hostess. We came in the back entrance and walked to the front. The hostess was not very polite or friendly and seemed a bit slow. I know that sounds mean but she acted like she really was not excited to be there. I get it, a hostess job is not exactly exciting, however, she could have at least acted somewhat happy to seat us. In any event, the booth she sat us at was filthy. The table was clean but the seating had crap all over it and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in god knows how long. It especially grossed me out when I went to wipe the seat with my hand so I could scoot over and some of the gunk from the seat stuck to my hand. Eeeewwwwwweeeeeee. Not only that, the cups were dirty and old. In fact, I know for a fact that they are the old cups from Serrano's. How do I know? Because I have eaten at Serrano's for a long time and I actually commented on how Serrano's needed new cups on one of their comment cards. A week later, new cups at Serrano's which was great but now I know where the old ones went! Anyways, on to the menu. It was your typical greasy spoon diner breakfasts. Sometimes I don't mind that but I have really been trying to watch what I eat lately so was hoping to get something with egg whites in it. It didn't appear that was even an option on the menu. In fact, there wasn't a whole lot of anything healthy on their menu. I opted for the veggie omelet on their special menu with home fries and wheat toast. The hubby had their special of the day which was chicken fried steak with gravy, eggs, and a biscuit. The portions were definitely large which also warranted the prices (the prices were good too). So this was a definite value for breakfast, however, the food was very mediocre. Both my husbands and my eggs were not seasoned whatsoever. On the plus side, the hubby said that the biscuit definitely tasted home made. A few other notes, I was especially disgusted when I saw one of the waiters (not ours thank god) picking his nose as he walked into the kitchen. Yuck. Lastly, the big creepy statue of the old man with a tray of candy needs to go. Halloween is over and wont be happening for awhile. Needless to say, this place a big let down and I am not very thrilled to go back again. However, I most likely will have to go one more time because the hubby wants to try the hobo omelet.   :(

We are having Roberts cater our company Christmas Party so I have decided to do a review on the service I have received currently and will do an updated review after the party. So far, my boss, the company VP, as well as myself absolutely love Roberts!!! Robert himself has been helping us and I would like to say that this man is one of the friendliest, funniest people I have ever met. And man, can he cook!!!! We went for a tasting and he made almost the entire menu of what we will be having at our party. All of the food was amazing! The prime rib was so flavorful and the creamy horseradish that accompanied it was absolutely wonderful. The VP of the company said he is not normally a horseradish fan but he loved this stuff. Also served was the oriental glazed salmon and the ham with chutney glaze. Both were beyond amazing. For sides, Robert had talked us into the smashed potatoes with garlic and herbs rather than your usual mashed potatoes and boy am I glad he did! These were some of the greatest potatoes I have ever had and my boss and the VP said they were great. Also good were the green beans with Julienne carrots. Just when I thought I couldn't eat another bite, Robert came out with slices of cake to sample. Let me just say that cakes are definitely his strong point although his food is almost as equally delicious. We tried several types of cake: spice cake with apple filling and light butter cream frosting, Roberts Grandma's carrot cake, a Bavarian cream cake, a champagne raspberry cake (I believe), a banana's fosters cake (my fav) and a chocolate mousse cake. All were unbelievable! We all had our favs but the VP loved the spice cake and said it was the best he has ever had. Although we already had a different place chosen for dessert, Robert convinced us to have a few of his cakes as well at the party and stated that he isn't going to charge us, just wants people to try his cakes and have some great word of mouth. Whats really incredible about Roberts was the price! I looked at several caterers and most were trying to charge us double and did not include table, chair and linen rental, something we needed. These other caterers argued that their food was better quality but after tasting Roberts food, I know we got the best of both worlds. Also, Robert was extremely helpful in showing us how to utilize the space at our office for the party and was great at communicating with me. I also have to say that his Julia Child impression is hilarious! One last thing: My company sells blinds and other home decor goods and Robert decided to purchase from us. We sent out a couple of reps to take measurements and place orders for blinds for him. Robert treated them both to lunch! Obviously, our reps both stated that the food was amazing but I was just shocked that Robert would offer to feed them and he stated he will do so again when they come to install the blinds. I think that is a great gesture and just shows what a great guy Robert is. NICEST GUY EVER!

So our Christmas party took place on Friday, December 3rd, and here is my update. Robert's completely exceeded my expectations. He, and his staff, went above and beyond to ensure that our holiday party was a huge sucess. Everyone I spoke to throughout the night complimented the food with several people confessing to being addicted to the chipotle mac and cheese. I will confess that I am addicted as well to Roberts mac and cheese. At one point, I went up for seconds, got a mound of mac and cheese, and although being full, I just kept eating it. At one point, I told my husband that I think I have a serious problem but eating that mac makes me so happy. Anyways, ok, getting past the mac and cheese, the rest of the food tasted terrific as well but aside from the mac and cheese, the oriental glazed salmon was my favorite. My husband even admitted to liking it and he doesn't care for salmon. He says that he is considering having salmon more if it taste like that did. The prime rib and ham were cooked to perfection, the smashed potatoes with herbs were a big hit, and the green beens and jullienned carrots had great flavor for being vegetables. Oh and how could I forget the french onion tartlets and ruben tartlets that we had for appetizers. The hubby loved these and said he could have eaten an entire plate of them. I kept seeing him sneak off during the party and I am almost positive that he was eating more tartlets! Lastly for the food, the cake was unbelievable as it was previously during our tasting and many employees thought it was the best cake they had ever had.  As for the service, all of Robert's staff was professional, clean cut, and friendly. They were very helpful in setting tables up, placing decor, and keeping everything cleared and clean.  In the end, everything was terrific: The staff was great, the decor was beautiful, the price was reasonable and the food unbelievable. Would I choose Roberts again? Definately, without a doubt, for both work functions and personal functions. In fact, this will be the first place I think of!

This place is great if you are looking for something sweet and are in Scottsdale. I had the tin roof sundae and it was out of this world. I love sweet and salty together. Sugar Bowl is also open late so its a great place to go if you are hungry or drunk or have the muchies and need something good to eat. The service, however, is a little slow and I would never dream of going during normal hours (I have been late at night) with the amount of kids that are probably there!

After much anticipation, I finally got to try this place for my birthday. It was awesome! Sat in the bar on a Sunday and took advantage of happy hour. I love that they have the all day happy hour and they have some great items on the HH menu! Their green chili pork appetizer is to die for. I made a Roaring Fork fan out of my husband on that alone. The burger is massive and is just downright a good burger. Well worth the 10.00 on the HH menu. Heck well worth the 13.00 on the normal menu! Fries were good as well. I loved the little kettles they served everything in, miner style! Huckleberry margarita on the HH menu was different but great. Only 5.00 too! I also opted for the Dr Pepper braised short ribs with cheesy grits. Delicious! The grits were my favorite part actually but they went so well with the ribs. A bit pricey but would I order it again, hell to the yes! Green chili mac was simply ok. Although it did actually taste like green chili, it was a bit dry for my liking. I must admit, I haven't been this excited about a restaurant since I tried Taco bell for the first time at age 5! Haha. Service was spot on as well. The only thing I didn't like was that if you don't have a reservation, its hard to get in. We were fortunate though that there was a table in the bar open for the happy hour. Others were not so fortunate and had to wait around for an hour by the door behind us to make sure they snatched up a table when it became available. Seems like a poor system. There should at least be a waiting list so you are guaranteed to get the first open table if you have been waiting around. Otherwise, someone could just take the table right from under you if you are not close enough or paying attention. Other than that, this place definitely lives up to the hype!

Came here for a Bachelorette party I was hosting. It was quite a difference from Revolver and Shotgun Betty's down the street. I really loved the atmosphere at Martini Lounge and how there were different sections all with something to offer. Revolver was so packed that you couldn't move, the bouncers were jackasses but the guys handling the bathrooms even more so, there were no places to sit unless you had bottle service, and the music sounded terrible. However, Martini Ranch was the opposite. The room with the live music was awesome and the upstairs "loft" I guess you would call it had lots of seating so you could still watch the live bands. Outside had a cool vibe and was nice if you wanted to just sit on the patio drinking. But the Shaker Room was where it was all at!!! Yes, there were some strange people in there (a couple of swingers that tried to kiss the Bachelorette), some old old men watching my and my posse, and a woman that tipped my girlfriend that was on the stripper pole. Still, it was an eventful evening with lots to talk and laugh about the following day. Also, the DJ was great. He managed to play Metallica songs with a hiphop/ clubbin beat, so not like other DJ's I have heard. We all had a great time and stayed till the ranch closed. One other great thing is that either this bar or our hotel were in the perfect location because we were able to walk less than 1/2 a mile and our hotel was right there. Great for when you have had a few too many. If you are having a Bachelorette party in downtown Scottsdale, definitely venture to Martini Ranch!

Came here with the Bachelorette party for some appetizers to tide us over since dinner was not till 7:30. Managed to come right as happy hour was beginning (3pm to 7pm). Had a couple of drinks (mango margarita was amazing), calamari, Vegas roll, and rainbow roll which we split. Everything was terrific. The calamari was sooo tender and I loved the batter on it. SInce we came for happy hour, everything was cheap and it was a great start to our night out.

The husband and I came here for our anniversary and enjoyed it very much. The restaurant was cozy and romantic with an old nostalgic charm. Our waiter rocked and was very quick to refill our drinks and bring our appetizer and meals. He was very friendly and knowing that we were first timers, he explained the menu and was highly informative. We ordered the Shrimp San Remo for appetizer which we probably would not order again. The sauce was flavorful and tasty, however, the shrimp was overcooked. Also, both of us were not happy campers later in the evening and we believe it was because of this appetizer. However, everything else was terrific. For entrées, I opted for the baked stuffed lobster with baked potato and vegi, and the hubby ordered some kind of sauteed scallop special with mushrooms, baked potato, and vegi. Everything tasted fabulous and we were stuffed. One additional note: I love that the waiter offers to crack the lobster crab for you. At the end of our meal when we thought we couldn't eat another bite, our waiter brought us a complimentary slice of snickers cheesecake because it was our anniversary. It was such a nice gesture and I will not lie, the cheesecake was amazing and really did taste like a snickers bar. So in all, this place was very good and a great option for a special occasion. My only complaints were the appetizer (I don't enjoy overcooked shrimp or being in the bathroom for an hour) and I wished the bread they served was warm (seemed like store bought cold bread). One other little side-note: If you hate seafood, this is probably not the place for you. I am not saying this because the menu has a majority of seafood, as you can still find steaks and other non seafood items, but because upon entering the restaurant, you are instantly greeted with the aroma of fish and other seafood. This could be a bit offputting for some. After a few minutes though, you get used to it if you don't mind the smell of seafood. Some people might not be able to get over it and it could be somewhat unpleasant. Additionally, they do sit you fairly close to other parties so if you don't like other people, you may not be happy with the seating arrangements. Lastly, make sure to make reservations as this place gets packed!

I am starting to conclude that this might just be my most favorite place in the world right now!!! So if I ever am missing and you are wondering where to find me, try this place first! I have been to the Improv so many times and have never really been let down. Almost all the comedians I have seen are extremely talented and hilarious. Let me see if I can name all the ones I have seen: Greg Berehnt (hes just not that into you), Michael Winslow (guy from Police acadamy movies), Gabriel Iglesius, Al Madrigal, Flip Orly (hypnotist), Michael McDonald (MAD Tv, not the singer), Jamie Kennedy, Johnny Sanchez (MAD Tv), and Bob Marley (no not the dead reggae singer). I would have to say the only one that didn't make me laugh as hard was Michael Winslow, there were some slow parts during his show. The rest were terrific though. My favorite is probably a tie between Al Madrigal and Johnny Sanchez. Yes, the no names seem to be the funnier ones. May its cause you go in not expecting much and they turn out to be awesome. Anyways, if you love to laugh and have a good time, this is the place for you.  Besides the entertainment, the food and drink is also decent. The hubby and I are a fan of their buffalo wings, zucchini chips, nachos, and cookie dessert. And of course, what goes better together than comedy and booze? Their electric lemonade is very tasty along with the simple oldie but goodie pineapple juice and malibu.Keep in mind when ordering tickets that besides the 20 or so $ for the tickets, you will also have to buy 2 items per person which is usually another $40-$50 for a night of fun and laughs. Not a cheap outing, but a really good one for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.Oh and a final tip, if its just you and one other person going, the high top tables in the back are the best to try to request one. Otherwise, you will be sat with complete strangers at some tiny table and are literally arm and arm most of the time....Its up to you but either way, you get the same amount of puny table space when you think about it. Oh and make sure you order your tickets online as they do sell out most of the time...

I can't believe all the negative reviews on this place!!! I have never had an issue with this place. Then again, I am not very picky when it comes to my steak. I rarely eat it and when I do, I smother it in steak sauce. So I really could care less about whether it's seasoned properly or cooked to my liking. I look at it as the steak being the vehicle to get the steak sauce into my mouf! Haha, yes I know its rediculous but I am not one of those people that is a diva when it comes to my steak, only when it comes to all other aspects of my meal. Anyways, I really like Monti's. Its the only place where I can get a side of spaghetti with my steak!!!!! And I have to say that their spaghetti is very good, so good in fact that I have ordered it as my meal a few times. Normally when I go, I order the filet with spaghetti, add a meatball, and green beans if they have them. There is something about this combination that is just soooo comforting and good. Maybe its just the italian in me. I will admit there were a couple of times when I asked for my steak medium and it came out medium well and once it was almost charred. However, I still walked away satisfied because of the steak sauce, spaghetti, green beans, salad (which has a great ranch dressing) and the bread. Oh yes, the bread is amazing. We call it grass bread because the rosemary on top looks like little pieces of grass. Haha.  Its always hot, soft, and buttery. Anyways, I would say that if you are big on your steaks, this place is kind of inconsistent so its possible that you might not have a good experience. But since I am not picky when it comes to steaks, I am almost always satisfied with my meal from Monti's. The service has never been bad and the prices are very reasonable for a steakhouse.  A couple of final tips, their garlic bread that comes with their spaghetti is very very good as well. Also, make sure you keep track of where you are sitting as you will most likely get lost in this maze if you have to excuse yourself from the table. Oh yes and their onion rings are great as well!

One of the best Mexican Restaurants in AZ. BEST BEAN DIP EVAR!!!! I don't know how they do it but I have seriously considered bribing someone to give me the dam recipe! The texture is nice, cheesy, and I love that they put tons of onions in it. I am a huge onion fan. The more onion, the better! Their salsa is great too. Very chunky, flavorful, and of course, lots of onions. Chips are crispy and they give you plenty. I only order one thing when I go to Serrano's.... Its the crunchy pork taco's. Shredded pork with spices, nice and greasy with lots of lettuce, tomatoes and their great salsa. Their rice and beans are good too but I always just get two pork taco's ala carte. The service is always speedy, yet friendly. Oh and did I mention that they have terrific fried ice cream??? One of my all time favorite desserts. Go here if you want cheap, tasty, quick Mexican food goodness!

Went here again last night and it was amazing as always. One thing I forgot to mention in my previous review is that this is one of the few places that actually pays attention to their comment cards. So if you see one with your bill, I would recommend filling it out if you have any suggestions. The husband really wanted pollo fundido on their menu so he kept writing that on their cards and low and behold, a few months later, there it was on the menu. He likes to take credit for that one and say he is the reason they have it. Haha. I also wrote on their card that they needed new cups cause the old ones they had were looking pretty grimy and not very good. A week after writting that, I go there and there are new cups being used. Its great that they really pay attention to what their customers have to say. On a sad note: We found out last night that they like to charge 1.75 for side of jalapenos. That kinda sucks! Maybe we will mention this in the comment card and suggest that they be free or 5 cents!

Sometimes, you just want a fat, juicy, really good burger. For those times, I usually hit up Fuddruckers. At Fuddys, I always know what I am gonna get. For those of you not familiar with Fuddys, its a walk up to order deal where you choose the size, style, and doneness of your burger, all sides are separate, and you get to choose your toppings from a buffet of everything you could imagine to go on a burger. NOW THAT'S A BURGER! I always get the smallest burger, no cheese (you will hear why in a second) with a large side of fries for me and the hubby to share.  Now I am gonna let ya in on a little secret... They have free unlimited nacho cheese sauce!!!!!!!!!     :O    Now this is gonna probably sound a bit crazy and gross but I love nacho cheese sauce! I love it so much that I think a nacho cheese fountain would be incredible and I would buy one to have at every single event I throw. I literally could drink the stuff! So there you go, and insiders secret: save yourself some money and do not order cheese on your burger and just lode it with nacho cheese sauce. Unless of course you are some crazy uptight weirdo that doesn't like cheese sauce... In that case, I would say you probably don't belong at Fuddys. Oh yeah, I like to also drench my fries in that exquisite sauce. Soooo yummy.  K so before wrapping up this review, I am going to be kind and let you all in on my secret burger recipe that I make every time I am at Fuddruckers. Get ready for a total foodgasm! I like to call it a "Jenn's Nacho Burger." I get a plain burger and put tons of nacho cheese (the regular kind but you can get the spicy cheese if you like more spice, oh yeah forgot to mention there are two kinds, what what!), salsa/ pico de gallo (yes they have it and its perfectly square chunks of tomato, onion, jalapenos, and some cilantro), extra diced onions (what can I say, I am an onion lover), and some jalapenos. YUM!!! You can send me a message to thank me later   :O  So moving on from the foodporn, I would say the service here is ok. Its nice that you don't have someone waiting on you so you do not have to tip. Nevertheless, the people you encounter for a whole 2 minutes to order your food from have always been friendly. As for the atmosphere,  this location, like most of their locations, are a bit dark and dreary with dated decor. This is also a total family spot so there are kids running around everywhere. Unfortunately, Fuddy's would have gotten five stars if it were not for this and the fact that once or twice, my burger was overcooked. Oh well, nothing unlimited nacho cheese can't fix!

Finally got around to trying the Arizona staple known as Los Dos Molinos. Yes, it is not traditional Mexican food, its actually New Mexican style. However, if you live in AZ, eating at Los Dos is a must!  Went with my husband to this location on our first visit. Normally, this is not the type of place that I would eat at. This particular location appears to be in an old car windshield repair building. However, the inside is clean and cozy. My only complaint really is that the some of the tables (such as the one we sat at) are really large and if you are sitting across from people, it feels like they are miles away! The second time visiting Los Dos was at their new Ahwatukee location. I enjoyed this location very much. We went on a weeknight and there was live music. Not only that but the location is new and really nice inside.  Now on to the food. I think it says something about the food when I say we went there a second time. The first time we went, I had the tamale and taco combo. Although spicy, the food was absolutely delicious. Yes its hot but its not super hot to where you can't taste the flavors. Both the salsa's were hot although I think the green is a little milder because there is more lime in it to tame it down. The sauce on the green corn tamale I had was very spicy but tasty. The tamale itself was good although I prefer mine a bit on the sweeter side. It really is preference though. Some people don't like sweet green corn tamales and if that is the case, the one at Los Dog is probably perfect for ya. The taco was delicious and not super spicy although you can tell that there is some spice in the meat. The husband has had the chimichanga with the adovada twice now and has really enjoyed it although he said that he was crying the first time he ate it due to the spice. The beans and rice are decent although they are really just there for the "cool down" period. The beans are whole pintos and although they taste good, I prefer refried. I especially would have preferred refried on my second visit when I ordered the tostada )it comes with the whole pintos). But to each his own, it really depends on preference.  I think Los Dos is a very good place with terrific New Mexican food. However, if you are not into spicy foods, its probably best for you to steer clear. They manage to put spice in everything it seems...  A tip: The Ahwatukee location has a special I believe on Wednesday that is a bucket of beers for 10.00. It actually seems like a good deal.

I am not one to usually do a review on a mall but I really wanted to put this place on a list and what can I say, this mall has everything! This place is fricken huge which is a good thing considering the amount of people that flock to it each day. At Fashion Square you can find a variety of people (rich housewives looking to spend the hubs money AKA Scottsdale snobs, hardworking business women, trendy guys, some couples. and normal every day people) and also a variety of stores that will cater to pretty much any type of person. There are highend stores (Nordstrom, Barneys, Neiman Marcus) but also more affordable trendy stores (the usual young women stores, macys, etc). Granted, I am more of a simple girl but I also like options and I like them all to be in one place. This is that one place. The only things I don't like is some of the people in the stores can be rude and snobby along with some customers, the mall is so large that it can be confusing to find your way around, and its so far away from me. If I was closer, then this would be my go to mall.

By far one of my favorite BBQ joints in AZ! I love me some BBQ but am also all about the sides. If I go to a BBQ place that has terrible sides, no matter how good the meat is, I most likely will not return. The meat and sides both need to be phenomenal for me to be satisfied! Famous Dave's gets it right with both! Ive gotten several meats from here (I go here a lot) and all have been great. These include the Georgia Chopped Pork, the brisket, the country roasted chicken (I think this is actually my favorite), and I definitely cannot forget about the sweet water catfish with remoulade and sweet chili sauce (Comes in second). Ive also tried a number of the sides and they are all awesome: mac and cheese is by far my favorite cause its creamy and has sweet corn and jalapenos in it. So different but some of the best mac I have ever had! Their potato salad also rocks. Its not sweet potato salad but its flavor is out of this world! Also great are the Wilbur beans and the firecracker green beans with bacon! YES BACON!. About the only side I am not fond of is their fries. I find these little steak fries to be mediocre at best. Additionally, most of the meals are served with a corn muffin which is sooooo good. Make sure you ask for honey with this. So yeah, this place makes me pretty happy each time I go here. One of the best things about it is the price. You can get a 2 meat combo with two sides, corn muffin, and corn on the cob for 13.99! That's AWESOME! Now on to a couple of things that could be better. They are not always consistent with their meat. The hub has stated that their Brisket is very inconsistent and sometimes is out of this world and other times a little dry. Same with the chopped pork. Also, sometimes the service is extremely slow and not very friendly. Lastly, the desserts could be better. Being a total bread pudding connoisseur, I order it wherever I go that they have it if I have room. Got it here once and was not impressed. It tasted more like cake and the maple sauce on it just wasn't my thing. If you want great bread pudding, hit up Charlestons. Also, I think Famous Daves uses the same cake in all their non chocolate desserts. Last night when I ordered the mini strawberry shortcake, it looked the same as the bread pudding but with a strawberry sauce instead of the maple sauce. Bread pudding is not cake so it should not be made with cake! Also, strawberry shortcake should have several strawberries in it rather then just a little slice with a thin runny strawberry sauce. But to each his own, this is just my opinion and some people might love their desserts. I will admit that their chocolate brownie sundae is pretty dam tasty. Anyways, if you are looking for great BBQ and sides at a great price, this is your place!

I agree with Robin C's review. Completely dead on. The wait was long but seemed to be moving till the point they put us in the multiple pay lines. My friend and I had a coupon so we were put in the last line which is apparently where all the couponers and Rio guest were sent as well. Lets just call this the "no body cares line" so you will basically be standing there not moving forever while all the other lines continuously flow. You will see people that were a half hour wait behind you be seated before you while you stand there hungry and upset without any Rio hostesses even looking in your direction. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore so I asked the Cashier what was up and he basically told me there was nothing he could do. I asked for his manager and he acted like he was going to talk to him. He came back, continued to ignore everyone including me without giving me an answer about where his manager was. It was absolutely ridiculous. Finally, I asked again and when the manager came, I let him have it. At that point, he spoke with the hostesses who then began seating people in our line. My friend and I were next in line when we noticed that other lines were then being sat first again! I called the hostess over, she asked how many (2) and then asked everyone else in back of us. She then proceeded to seat all the larger groups in back of us! I asked her what the F was going on and she told me that she had 4 top tables and we were a 2 top. So after another minute or so of waiting I called her back over, pointed out multiple two tops that were open and she yelled at me stating that we were supposed to go with the other larger groups because 4 top tables can seat 2 people. I told her that I am not a fricken idiot, I know what was said! At that point, it wasn't worth it. I just went to our table and took full advantage of that damn buffet.  You name it, I tried it, didn't care how much food I wasted. The food wasn't even that great. I had been to the Rio multiple times before and the food was much better and I remember genuenly thinking that it was the best buffet I had been to. However this time, I realized that no buffet is good. Buffets are just full of crap that is not fresh and they charge an arm and a leg for it. If I want good fresh Chinese food, I can pay 7.00 and get full, not 40.00 for crap! Anyways, the other times I had been to the Rio carnival buffet, the seating didn't seem nearly as disorganized. Perhaps it was because we paid full price those other times. Seems like they give those people priority when they should be just going off the time on the receipt and seating the people that have been there the longest first. Gee what a concept?!?  So to conclude, although this buffet has the reputation of being "The best Buffet" in Vegas, I would never return. Go here at your own risk if you like as much as you can eat crap food and like to wait in line for over an hour and a half. Just make sure to eat before coming or come with a stocked purse of snacks for when you are waiting. Also, make sure you have no set in stone plans for after your dinner. The family in back of us had booked a show for a few hours after they decided to come to this buffet. Needless to say, once they finally got in, the mom had to rush to the box office and see if she could change their show times. Apparently, that was not possible because that family was only able to spend about 30 minutes there to eat and had to run. They couldn't even get their moneys worth and try everything that the buffet had to offer. I thought it was pretty sad. Did I also mention that they were guest of the hotel? You would think that being guest, the box office would have been willing to work with them since their Buffet is full of incompetent jerk employees.  The one upside is that our waiter was very nice and very attentive, something I didn't expect after the service we had received while in line.

I just went here for lunch today after reading lots of good reviews. I have to say that I cannot argue with the great reviews. The atmosphere is fun and the prices were decent. I ordered the brisket with mac and cheese, BBQ beans, and pecan coleslaw. The hubby ordered the brisket, pulled pork, shoestring fries and roasted veggies. The meats was amazing, so tender and moist. The BBQ sauce had the perfect flavor, not too tangy but not too sweet, and also not too thick. And the sides, OMG sooooo good. The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy, the beans were sweet and meaty, and the coleslaw was creamy, refreshing, and the pecans were a nice contrast. The hub let me try his fries and although they were very small and thin, they had a good flavor and I loved that some were soggy (I love soggy, greasy fries). Oh and how could I forget, they give you cornbread cakes before your dinner arrives. They were very tasty. They also give you mini hot doughnuts with cinnamon and sugar at the end of your meal. They were good, however, a little dry. I think they could have used more flavoring in the dough or maybe some sort of icing to dip them in. My only other complaint is that our waitress was a bit slowing in refilling our water and bringing a box along with our check. I would say that this place definately lives up to the hype and positive reviews. However, living in Maricopa, it takes close to an hour to get to Bobby Q's. So I probably wont be driving out there just to eat at Bobby Qs but if I was in the neighborhood, I would definately make sure to stop  :)

If you are a carnivore, this is the place for you! For about 30.00, you can have unlimited salad bar, cheesy rolls, rice, beans, fried bananas, crab legs, pineapple and best of all MEAT. In case you have never been to a a Brazilian Steakhouse, here is what you can expect: You start with their wonderful salad bar that has a wide array of salads and side dishes, then you turn over this tri colored stick which sends the message to start bringing the meat along with all the fixins. They will bring you the best hot cheesy rolls ever, rice and beans, and some terrific fried bananas. Then comes the meat on skewers. They come to your table with multiple types of meat and you tell them if you want it. If so, they will cut off a piece for you. Before you know it, you have an entire plate filled with various meats and the best sweetest grilled pineapple. To wrap it up, this place is awesome! The price is reasonable and the service is always spot on. Try this place if you like lots of meat. You will not be sorry!

I was very excited to try this place after reading all the positive reviews and also seeing their extensive menu. Upon arriving, we were surprised to see just how small this place was (the pictures make it look bigger) and also surprised to see several leaks from the ceiling. Many tables were not available to be used because there were giant buckets at or near them catching water that fell from the ceiling (we had a storm a day before). Kind of off putting but we decided to stay and give it a try anyway. The husband decided to have a gyro since his logic told him that a euro cafe should have the best gyros. The waitress assured him that it would be the best gyro he has ever had. I opted for the pork molise which was pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon with roasted garlic, caramelized onions, apricot and cherry glaze with horseradish mashed potatoes.  We were informed by the waitress that there are no changes to any items on their menu which was fine with us. However, I think its ridiculous that they are completely unwilling to compromise in the case of food allergies. As a restaurant, I feel they have an obligation to do that. Anyways, the salad that came before my meal was good thanks to the feta dressing. It was very good dressing and my husband was disappointed when he got his gyro and it didn't have that feta dressing much less any feta for that matter. Feta is a key component of a gyro I always thought. he also said that the yogurt sauce didn't have any flavor.  Correct me if I am wrong but isn't tiziki sauce supposed to be present on gyros? Needless to say, this was not the best gyro the hub had ever had and he informed me that we make better ones at home using roast beef and ranch dressing. Haha. As for my meal, it was ok. But honestly, it tasted like something I have made at home out of the crock pot. I'm sorry but when I go to a restaurant, I expect to be wowed and to have a meal that I don't feel like I could replicate at home. Anyways, I am all about second chances so if someone wanted to go here, I would go but I don't know if it had enough potential for me to go back on my own.

So far, I have tried all three of Joe's restaurants: Joe's real BBQ, Joe's Farm Grill, and Liberty Market. I love them all but I think this is probably my favorite. I order the same meal here every time I go because it is just that good. Its the chopped BBQ Brisket sandwich with a side of mac and cheese and sometimes sweet corn if I am super hungry. The sandwich is huge, the meat has a great flavor, and the mac and cheese is some of the best I have ever had. I mean, come on, they crush up cheeze it's or goldfish and put them on top to make a crust. If that isn't love, I don't know what is! The corn is good but corn is corn, how bad can you screw it up? I've also had their beans before and they are really good except I am not a fan of lima beans so I kinda wish they were left out. Oh and Joe's has this great onion relish to put on your sandwich that is unlike anything I have ever tasted!!! If you are a fan of onions and you go to Joe's, you must try this stuff.  I have also tried both types of cake, lemon and rootbeer and although they were both good, I would have to say that the lemon is the clear winner.  The only thing I would say that I don't like about Joe's is where the drink dispensers are. Its a real pain to get a refill if there is a line. Also, you better make sure you pick up everything you will need when your going through the line unless you want to have to push past people later on to get what your missing.  Joe's is definitely one of the best BBQ joints in the Phoenix area. Keep it up Joe!!!

I was soooo excited to hear about a German Restaurant in Arizona. After visiting Berlin and Franfurt for a week, I absolutely fell in love with German food.  While the service was great and prices were decent, the food was not as exciting as I thought it would be. For an appetizer, we ordered the stuffed mushrooms. This was a great start to the meal because they were great. Possibly the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever had. Cream Sauce was amazing and the shredded sweet potato on top was a nice touch. That, along with my beer, were the best parts of the meal I would say. For dinner I chose the bratwurst with sour kraut and German potato salad, and my husband chose the paprika schnitzel with wersing and German fried potato's. Both of us had the soup of the day as well which was cream of mushroom. The soup was decent although it could have used a bit more salt. My meal was ok but comparing this to similar meals in Germany, I felt it was kinda boring and lacking. Also, the curry ketchup I ordered was not what I expected. Curry Ketchup in Germany is a lot like BBQ sauce in taste. The stuff I got at Haus Murphy's just didn't taste right to me. It tasted like ketchup with a curry aftertaste. Anyways, my husband did not like his paprika schnitzel at all. The flavor also seemed a bit odd. If you don't like curry, do not order this dish! The fried potato's were mediocre (kinda boring). The wursing, on the other hand, was very good. I think its because it had the same cream sauce as what was in the mushrooms. After dinner, we decided on bread pudding for dessert. This dessert definitely needed some work. There was not enough spice in it so it tasty like nothing more than bread soaked in eggs most of the time eating it. In any event, Haus Murphy's wasn't bad. I am rating it based on whether I would continue to go there and since I am in Maricopa and its in Glendale, the food would have to be spectacular to make me want to come back. Unfortunately, only a couple of small portions were close to being spectacular which I am not sure make it worth the time, effort, and money to return again.

K so its totally unlike me to do a review on anything other than restaurants but I felt I needed to spread the word about this fabulous hotel. I hosted a bachelorette party and booked this hotel for me and a few of the party people to stay at. I was worried that there would be some speed bumps when trying to check in, the quality of the room, etc. But no, everything was amazing!!! Check in was easy, I was able to get do early check in with no problem, late 2:00 checkout for free, and get a room on the bottom floor since I had alot to carry in and set up in the room. The room was fairly large and nicely decorated. There was a huge sectional couch, a wet bar with fridge, two queen beds, large LCD TV, granite counter tops, free wifi, free parking, and free continental breakfast for a little over 100.00 a night. The beds were very comfortable and I loved that the sink and mirrors were outside of the bathroom so the space was large enough for a bunch of girls getting ready. The staff was very friendly and accomodating giving us complimentary bottles of water and helping to accomodate my guests parking. Did I mention that it was within walking distance to the clubs (Across the parking lot from Revolver, Martini Ranch) and also dining? PERFECT LOCATION if you are partying in Old Town Scottsdale. The only negative was the breakfast (usual continental breakfast of breads, danishes, juice, cereal and fruit) but with everything else, I can't complain about something that is not even offered at some hotels during the economic crisis we are experiencing now.

Decided to try this place yesterday after having pizza from Gilbert Pizza next door. The hubby is a big fan of gyros and figured that since he is never in that area, he might as well try a gyro. After realizing they had crepes (I fricken love crepes and thought back to the wonderful ones I had in Germany) I was sold on going for dessert. The service was very friendly, the owner was so funny and warm. Our waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating as well. They treated us like we were family even though they didn't even know our names. Hubby ordered the gyro, I ordered the nutella crepes with strawberry and banana. The gyro is large for what you pay and has tons of meat in it, no lettuce which made the hubby very happy. The only thing was that there was no feta on it which we feel is a key component of a gyro. He said the gyro was good and a good value but he would prefer the sauce to have more flavor and for some feta to be added. My crepes came with just banana, no strawberry, however, I decided not to mention it because the crepe was out of this world. I loved the crispy edges. The owner noticed though that there were no berries and quickly brought some over. They made it even better! Definitely get the crepe with berries! You wont be sorry. They also have a lunch buffet on Friday - Sunday which looked sooo tempting if we hadn't just eaten a half a pizza next door. Haha. We will have to go there and try the buffet as everything looked really delicious.

Keep in mind that I am not one of those people that goes crazy for pizza. I rarely crave it I think because I rarely have a pizza that is worth praise and worth craving. That was the case until I tried Gilbert Pizza yesterday (see my review). I had Oregano's last week and it sucks for them that I am writing this review right now because I am comparing them up against what a pizza and garlic bread should be. Granted, these places don't quite compare at this point because I have yet to order a traditional normal pizza from Oregano's. However, I can say that everything I have ordered during the two times I have gone to Oregano's has been subpar. The first time, I believe I ordered the tuna sammich with sweet potato fries. The bread was crazy crusty and not hot and fresh which was a big downfall for the sammich. I am a huge sweet potato fries fan and Oregano's does not make the cut for that. The other night when me and a few girlfriends came here, we ordered the garlic bread and the picazzo pizza. I had the Dirty monkey cocktail and it was ok. The garlic bread was ok but a little too cheesy tasting for me. I love cheese, don't get me wrong, but there was something not so great about the cheese on this. The marinara served alongside was good though, I will give them that. The pizza was not very good. It was kinda a southwest pizza with chicken, cheese, white sauce I think, tortilla strips, peppers, and I don't know what else. I thought it was meh and then I tried it with the southwest ranch my friend was hiding from us. It still didn't taste like anything special. I don't get it, every time I have passed by this place, there is always a huge wait. So far everything I have had there has been mediocre at best. Ive heard time and time again that the pizookie is to die for but why would I go there and wait for 2 hours for something that could easily be made at home? I will say this though, after tasting their marinara, I still feel that I need to try a normal pizza here to give it a final rating and determine whether this place is a no go in my book. Also tempted to try a pasta... After all, with the hype this place gets, maybe there is something I am missing....

Alright, this is the last time I am gonna give this place a chance. I have attempted to try every type of food they have here to see exactly what the hype is all about and why Oregano's is always at least a 30 min wait to be seated. This last time I went, I vowed to order one of the salads and their traditional pepperoni pizza because these are the items I have heard so much about from other people. I tasted some of the Picasso salad and a regular garden salad. Yes both were large, but all that came to mind while eating them was "meh." The ranch dressing that came with my garden salad tasted straight out of the bottle and the Picasso salad was nothing impressive. I swear there was more tortilla strips in that salad then lettuce. Don't get me wrong, I love tortilla strips, but they are supposed to accent the salad, not act as the entire salad! Now on to the pizza... I had tried their Picasso pizza before and was not impressed. I figured I ordered wrong so I decided to get a simple slice of pepperoni pizza this time around. Nothing impressive to be honest. Too much cheese that was melted but not gooey almost like it had been sitting, the marinara sauce was nothing special and it really didn't have any flavor, and the thin crust was almost non existent. It tasted like I was eating just a big blob of cheese! Plus, there was a small hair on it. Oh and I didn't even mention that for 2 salads, and 2 lunch special pizza slices, we waited about 45 minutes? I just don't get what the hype is about with this place. Maybe people in AZ don't know good pizza? If ya want good pizza, head to Nello's or Sal's Gilbert Pizza. Skip Oregano's. Unless your taste-buds are severely lacking, you are in for a letdown.

I am reminded of how much I hate Walmart every time I go into this particular location. There are always creepy people, it smells bad, their carts are rickety, their produce dept bad, bakery items spoiled before expiration, and they never have exactly what your looking for in the electronics department. Have been there twice looking for Dance Central and they don't have it. Would give it one star but the other star is for easy to navigate store, location (down the street from my work), and cheap and good selection in the food department. Other than that, I hate this place

I wouldn't say that overall, this is the best BBQ place in the valley but for what I get there, its the best. I have tried their pulled pork sammich and was not overly impressed. However, what I am impressed with is their hot link sammich, BBQ beans, and their corn on the cob. The hot links are juicy and spicy, the beans are thick and have lots of meat in them, and the corn is actually a large ear of corn that doesn't taste like the frozen kind. The sauce is very good as well. When I want a simple BBQ sammich and a few sides, this is one of the places I think of.

Los Favoritos makes the best breakfast burritos that I have tasted so far!!! I get the egg, potato, and cheese burrito. The eggs are fluffy, the cheese plentiful, and the potatoes are FRENCH FRIES! If thats not love, I dont know what is. Haha. I love mixing their green and red sauces on my burrito to make a christmas sauce. Their burritos are not huge but a pretty good size and a pretty cheap breakfast when you compare to how much you would pay to get full at McDonalds or Wendy's. The only issue I have is that they don't speak much english there. Other than that, the breakfast burro with no meat is great and the atmosphere, although a little plain, is clean which is one of my biggest fears in little taco shops like this. I have been to some Filibertos that I felt were not very clean and honestly was a little skeptical to even try Los Fav's. Now that I have, I will have to give more of these little taco's shops a try and start listening to the hub a little more!

Short review on this one as I have been twice now and have had the same thing both times... sausage and caramelized onion pizza with extra caramelized onion. Sooooooo good. I love thin crust pizza and this one is fabulous due in large part to the pizza sauce and the divine toppings. Who doesn't love caramelized onion and sausage??? Have also tried a bite of the mac and cheese which was pretty good as well but the portion size was pretty small. The pizza sizes are great for one person (or two people with small appetites) but the price is a little high. The service wasn't bad from what I remember also and was fairly quick.

Had ridden the Light Rail one other time before when it had first opened. Maybe its because we only took it from one area of ASU to Mill that it seemed like a pleasant experience and it could have also been because it was new.  My friend and I decided to take the light rail again to go to the Yelp Ultimate Science fare at the AZ Science Center. We boarded the train at Main St. and Dobson and got off the train at Washington and 3rd. For some reason, it took 25 minutes for us to just get moving from the Main Street station. Then of course the train had multiple stops. Keep in mind that we got on the train at Main St at 5:45. We didn't arrive at the AZ Science Center till 6:45. Therefore, it took an entire hour to get to the Science Center when it would have taken about 30 minutes to just drive there from Main Street and Dobson. Slllllooooowwwwww. Not only that, some of the people on the train were weird and we ended up sitting in front of a bum on the way back. I probably wont ride the train again. Not worth it and I dont' care about the environment. Haha

Chick Fil A is one of my favorite fast food places. Their regular chicken sammiches are off the hook, their slaw is perfect with the right amount of creaminess, and their waffle fries are different but delicious. Plus their sauces are out of this world! I love the polynesian or chick fil a sauce to dip my fries in. Also terrific is their chargrilled chicken sammich which is also one of the healthiest fast food entrees around. Make sure you get the honey BBQ sauce to go with it. Whenever I need a healthy lunch, I always go here. I also love that you can get other sides besides the fries like fruit (the fruit cup has good fruits in it too like apple, strawberries, grapes, oranges), salads, etc. And how could I forget their oreo shake. Out of this world. This is the only place I get shakes from.  About the only thing I have not cared for is their chicken salad sammich. It has egg in it which is a bit odd and just doesnt taste very fresh. Other than that, this place is great.  I have never had any issues with service at any of the locations. The food is a bit overpriced but its better quality and tastes a lot fresher and lighter than other fast food chains. I do want to add one more thing: I am pretty sure that someone that worked for KFC early on before they become big formed Chick Fil a because their chicken breading tastes almost the same and the slaw is almost identical. Coincidence? I think not!

I am a simple kinda girl, simple taste, and I like simply cheap prices. I went here with some girlfriends expecting a fun shopping experience and I just about had a heart attack when I saw the prices. I swear, whoever priced the items in this store really loved the number 78 because almost everything here was 78.00!!! Didn't matter if it was pants, shirt, purse. Saw a white t shirt with a few sparkles, surprise! 78.00! Also, the dresses were 180.00 average. What bothered me the most was that none of the items stood out to me as anything I couldn't find at the Kohls down the street. I don't mind spending a little extra for quality and more flare/ style but definitely couldn't justify it at this place! What was supposed to be enjoyable for me turned into me wandering around the store hyperventilating as I attempted to find an item for less than 20.00. When I finally did come across said item, it was a lingerie like top that was snagged and had a few small stains. WTF? I will say that the staff was friendly, and the dressing rooms were nice. Oh and the cookies they served were delicious hence the additional star. However, I walked out of here empty handed and honestly, I was happy I did since I would have to sell my car (notice how I did not say house) in order to afford anything in the place!

I don't normally do reviews on places other than restaurants, however, Maricopa Wells is an exception to my rule simply because of how great this vets office is. In fact, I have been meaning to do this review for awhile now. We used to take our dogs to a vet in Mesa but needed something closer since we live in Maricopa. I must say that Maricopa Wells is perfect for us not only in terms of location but in terms of price, hours, and the staff is fabulous with our animals. Every time we have gone, the staff has treated our little doggies so great and they always manage to fit us in even when we have no appointment. They are open from 7:30 AM to 8:00 PM on most weekdays and they are open on both Saturdays and Sundays. Its great for working pet owners because you can drop off your pets before work and pick them up after! Also, they allow you to kennel your pet for a daily fee (which was pretty reasonable) and they will accommodate any requests you have for the animals while they are staying there. Our little chihuahua had parvo and needed to be medicated several times a day for several days. Our pug Winston had an eye condition and needed to be medicated several times a day as well. We work so taking them to Maricopa Wells and having this handled was very convenient. Yes, their prices may be slightly higher than other vets (our other vet was a little cheaper) but if you live in Maricopa, its a great place to take your pet and their hours kinda make up for the little extra you pay for their services. My husband and I love Maricopa Wells and so do our furry little friends  :)

I only come here for breakfast, coming for dinner freaks me out a bit. Even if I come during dinner hours, its for breakfast. Haha. K so here is whats good: pancakes (or wonderful little pancakes as the hubby calls them), eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, french toast, hash browns and believe it or not, their strawberry crepes. I loves these crepes! I am soooo happy they have a meal (incredible VIB) now where you can pick pretty much anything you want for breakfast and can mix and match. The only thing that sucks about this that you cant order double of an item unless you add on a 5th item. Kinda dumb but I have been told that this is the way their system works. So our friend met us there one time and wanted to get 3 servings of french toast and then a serving of bacon. The waiter told him he would need to add 3 more differing items to his order in order to triple the french toast like he wanted. WTF? Anyways, this is a simple place to go for your basic breakfast at a cheap price. They also have great apple pie. Make sure to come for free pie Wednesdays!!!

This is one of my most favorite restaurants. Each time I have gone, the food and service has been great. Their bread is probably one of the best bread loaves I have ever had and I can make a meal out of that and that alone. Freshly baked and slightly doughy still, its magnificent. When I first started going to Firebirds, I would order the pork tenderloin with a sweet and sour glaze and the southwest au gratin potatoes. Sooooo good. Now its no longer on the menu   :(   Anyways, I have found a replacement in the grilled salmon with veggies and Parmesan mashed potatoes.I always ask for peach salsa on the side too to put on the fish. It is honestly one of the best salmon meals I have ever had at any restaurant and surprisingly, one of the healthiest items at Firebirds. I love that they list their nutrition facts on their website. Anyways, my husband loves the prime rib and loaded baked potato. He says that the prime rib is consistently good and flavored really well. Also, Firebirds has some awesome wings for appetizers and their tortilla slaw with coconut shrimp appetizer is to die for. The slaw is so different but very tasty. Oh and for dessert, their key lime pie and brownie sundae are pretty legit. There are only a couple of things that I have tried that I was not overly impressed with: Tortilla soup (creamier than I like and not much flavor), pecan crusted trout was kinda dry.  The service at Firebirds has always been great. There was one time when my salmon was raw in the middle. The waitress took it away and continuously apologized. A manager came over and offered to give me any appetizer and as much bread as I wanted at no charge while I waited for my meal to be recooked. They also gave me dessert on the house. The managers as well as their staff genuinely care about the customers it seems which is something I haven't seen in a long time at other restaurants. Their prices are also decent. I personally thought the prices, service, and quality of food at Firebirds far surpassed The Keg. My husband and I will definitely continue to come to this restaurant over places like the Keg and more upscale steakhouses!

I used to go here for lunch all the time when I worked out there. The food was spectacular and the service was always friendly and quick. I always got the stuffed tomatoes with chicken salad which came on a bed of greens with their non fat raspberry dressing. It was amazing! The prices are a little higher than your typical sammich shop but definitely not as high as some (yes I am talkin to you Paradise Bakery). Make sure you try this place if you are in the neighborhood!!! You wont be sorry.

I am happy to report that I love Costco. They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O

Pretty damn good pizza... I really liked the veggie one. Crust taste hot and fresh, even the outer portion that no one eats is really good. Service was friendly but pizza coming out was pretty slow. There are always coupons for this place so the price is pretty good. All in all, I am pretty happy I finally tried this place and I will return.    :)

Costa Vida has become one of my favorite lunch spots and I will tell ya why... The food is amazing, cheap, and filling. Here are my recommends: Get the salad with shredded beef, pinto beans, everything else, and ranch. If you get the large, its huge so you might not be able to finish it. If you get the small, make sure you get the large tortilla with it as that is the best part of the meal. The tortilla's are made fresh and they are great! If your not a salad person, get the chicken or shredded beef enchilada (1 is enough for me) with medium sauce and double rice. I also get a small side of ranch to go on my salad garnish along with a large side of the medium enchilada sauce. Ranch and the enchilada sauce make for a goupy rice but it taste awesome! A couple things I dont recommend to get: Anything with the sweet pork, this is just personal preference for me because I think its a bit too sweet and overpowering but if you like sweet meat, you will probably like it. Also, the shrimp taco's with mango salsa are nothing impressive and the nachos are nothing great either. They don't seem to put enough cheese and meat on the nachos.  Even though this place can get really crowded, the staff here is very quick and friendly. A little tip: They have whole wheat tortilla's if you are following a special diet.  FInal word: If you can manage to tune out all the kids and mormon women that come here, you will definately love the concept and the food. This place is the best when compared to Chipotle, Q Doba, Moes, Taco Del Mar, and Cafe Rio. However, I don't know if I can say they are better than Bajio, that place was amazing and I am soooo sad that its no longer in AZ   :(

I don't usually shop at AJ's unless I am looking for something very specific that I cannot find anywhere else. The item in the past has been canoli shells. I like to make home made canolis occassionally but I am never daring enough to make the shells. I can never find them anywhere other than AJ's. I would say that if you are looking for something special that the average grocery store doesnt have, try AJ's. They are a bit expensive though so I would go here as a last resort. Now normally, I would give this place only 3 stars, however, yesterday, I discovered their dessert counter. OMG, I was in heaven! I knew they had cakes and fruit tarts (which btw are outstanding although 30.00 apiece), however, they also have a vast array of mini gourmet desserts for when you have a major sweet craving and want something special to satisfy it. Im talking mini carrot cakes, mini fruit tarts (yes!!! I dont have to pay 30.00 whenever I want a tart from them), mini tiramisu's rounds, brownies, canoli's (WTF?) and even mini creme brulees! Additionally, they have home made chocolates which looked equally delicious. I opted for the tiramisu which was not only tantalizing but light, creamy, and honestly, one of the best Tiramisu's Ive had in awhile probably since the wine train in Napa. My best friend said that her praline chocolates were very good as well. I got a brownie for the hubby which is enormous and I will post an update once he tries it. What's even better is that the mini desserts are really reasonably priced so if you are looking for a dessert for someone to celebrate a birthday, anniversary, whatever, this is a great place to go.

This is one of our favorite places for lunch! I'm gonna clue you all into the best things on their menu: The Broccoli cheese soup is creamy and delicious, great for a cold winters day, probably the best that you can get since Chilis no longer has theirs. Their chicken salad sandwich on a croissant (do the build your own) with lettuce and tomato is amazing, chicken salad probably the best I have ever had with bits of pineapple in it (how original is that?). I also love their SW chicken chili which is pretty healthy with only around 250 calories per serving if I remember right. The roasted tomato tuna wrap is very tasty for being on their "healthy menu." (see next paragraph for what I really think of their healthy menu). Their ceasar side salad is fricken huge and the dressing is terrific, very light which is surprising for ceasar. Their salad bar has alot of great stuff to choose from and I love that you can get pasta and potato salad up there as well. Their pasta salad and tuna pasta salad are to die for. Lets see, what else. their fruit cup is always full of fresh fruit and my favorite kinds too (strawberries, cantelope, and grapes), and the dip that comes with it is sooooo good and different. Its a creamy yogurt dip but it is an amazing accompaniment with fruit. Lastly, I am going to clue you all into a little secret: Their desserts are scrumptious! Well at least the two I have had. Believe it or not, they probably have the best baklava and strawberry shortcake I have ever tried!!! For not being a Greek place, they do a mean baklava! It is light but so sweet and nutty the way that baklava should be in my opinion. The shortcake is great too and is very large with lots of berries. A little tip: when ordering a sammich, they automatically come with chips. I don't think they are very good, taste like ruffles, so for a little extra I always order a different side like pasta salad or fruit and you should too! Ok so now that you know what to order. Here are some other things you probably would need to know. Its a walk up restaurant and you have to get your own drinks. They bring your food out to you but there is no tipping involved which is always nice in my opinion. They may be a little pricier than some sammich shops like say Subway, but I wouldn't say they are overly expensive like Paradise Bakery. The service is always quick and friendly. Their catering is terrific and everything is always fresh and delicious. Very quick too. I can call an hour before I need the trays ready and they will have them ready for me when I need them. Here is the only downside I see with this place: their "healthy items" on the menu. If you actually look up the calorie counts on these, you will be shocked, they are no different from most of the other items on their menu. I was hugely disappointed when I was on a mission to lose weight and found out that the turkey wrap I had been ordering that was supposed to be healthy was most likely the thing holding me back from my 125 pound aspirations. In any event, the wrap was delicious so I should have known better. Haha. Can't ding them too bad for one little glitch on their menu. Lastly, most important part! What you can get for free: crackers, mini cornbread and gingerbread muffins, toast points, and frozen yogurt! I LOVE FREE STUFF so I take full advantage! Need some crackers at work for soup, look in my desk drawer, piles of them thanks to Jason's! Need my sweet fix, go to Jason's, pay tree fitty for a bowl of soup and then get a free yogurt cone! Woot Woot, I love you Jason's

Came here for my birthday which was on a Wednesday in March. The weather was beautiful and breezy. There were some people but there were many open tables so we got right in. We also brought our little dog since we planned to go hiking after and wanted to bring her. It was nice to find a place to bring your four legged friend! Anyways, the first thing we noticed was the self serve coffee, water and lemonade. We actually liked this idea! The only thing that I had an issue with is that they don't mention that there is a charge for the lemonade. They really should have a sign or something that mentions this. While looking over the menu, we noticed that the trees above us kept shedding leaves which we really were not excited about getting into our meals when they arrived. The waitress was really nice and moved an umbrella over to shield us a little from the greenage dropping into our food.  I decided on the monti cristo (over easy eggs, ham, and swiss cheese sandwiched between french toast with maple syrup) and my husband chose the cheese omelet with home fries. The monti cristo was soooo good. The only issue was that I noticed pieces of paper packaging still on my ham. It wasn't very much but it was a bit irritating having to peel little pieces of paper off of my ham! My husband was not impressed with his meal at all. He said the cheese on the omelet was nothing more than velveeta, the biscuit served with his meal was grainy and tough, and the home fries were not very flavorful.  The prices were pretty high for breakfast and my husband said his breakfast didn't even fill him up.  After breakfast, we walked around the farm a bit which was cool. The only thing we noticed was that there were no signs up next to each crop stating what they were. I would have liked to know what each was.  To sum it up, it was a nice, peaceful atmosphere and I was happy that I could bring my little doggie. However, I didn't feel it was worth the price and being the fattie that I am, I really don't like to have distractions from eating my meals (leaves falling in my food, packaging on my ham...). I don't think we would go back unless our dogs wanted to go our for breakfast. Haha

Went here yesterday for the first time after hearing the hubby go on about this place for months. He is not even a big fan of pizza but he loves this place. After trying it, I can definitely see why. Honestly, I have to say this is the best pizza I have ever had! I have been thinking and thinking digging back to my childhood but can't think of a better place for pizza than this. We ordered a large pizza with sausage and onion and an order of garlic knots. The knots were buttery cheesy little pillows of goodness and the marinara that was served with them was one of the best marinaras I have had (they tie with Rigatonies). I could have settled on just 4 orders of these bad boys and at 1.60 for an order of 6, that is what I think I might do for a cheap lunch one day! I have heard that sometimes they just give these out, however, you will want to order some just to be safe cause if you don't get them, you will be very sad. Cmon, they are a 1.60 now! Now for the pizza... the crust was the perfect thickness, not too thin, not too thick, and I loved how every bite was nice an crispy. The cheese on it was melty, gooey, greasy, and had almost a creamy consistency. Unlike any cheese I have ever had and out of this world! The sausage was very different as well. Its thin slices of meat almost resembling gyro meat but its sausage. I don't know where they get their cheese and sausage but I will tell ya that these are not your average run of the mill cheese and sausage. Whats nice is that you can tell that almost everything is made from scratch and with love. The marinara I am positive is home made, heck maybe even the cheese and sausage are home made. Haha. Since I work so close, I am going to have a problem especially in the weight department because I think I am going to go here a lot now! Anyways, if you are looking for the most awesome pizza you will ever have in your life at a reasonable price, you will get it here for sure! A few tips: Sal, the owner, is a bit standoffish but I think he is very serious about his pizza that he doesn't have time to talk to customers. Don't take it personally. Haha. Also, after 4, this place turns into an actual restaurant so if you want cheaper, you will wanna go for lunch or really really early dinner so you don't have to tip.

It had been such a long time since I ate at the Elephant Bar. I am not sure why I quit going though because after eating there a week ago, I realize that this place is the best for salads. Hence the 5 stars, my favorite place for a good healthy salad. Oh maybe not healthy, but great nonetheless. Honestly, I have only tried one entree on their menu, the honey mustard chicken salad. Its so good though that I cannot bring myself to try anything else. The dressing on it is creamy yet sweet, yet not overpowering like some honey mustard can be. I also love that they finish the dish with a thick balsamic syrup which honestly MAKES IT! The chicken is always tender and the panko crust is always crispy. Its just an AMAZING salad! When I went there last, my party opted for the sweet potato fries as an appetizer. They were very tasty and the Asian spicy ketchup they served with the fries had a unique but definitely great flavor. A couple of dishes worthy of mention: The Thai High Chicken salad (my dad let me try a bite of his and it was delicious though not as delicious as the honey mustard salad in my opinion) and the shrimp skewers appetizer. And lastly, dessert cannot be forgotten. My dad, step mom and myself opted to share the brownie tower dessert which came with... you guessed it, brownies! It also had mint chip ice cream (my fav) and home made whipped cream. It was fricken huge! The brownies were some of the best brownies I have ever had. I loved that they had giant dark chocolate chocolate chips inside of them. Ummmmm, I am salivating just thinking about it. Anyways, for some reason, this place gets forgotten and I am not sure why because every time I have gone here, it has been absolutely delightful. I will definitely keep Elephant Bar on my brain from now on!  PS: They have a killer strawberry, banana smoothie (non alcoholic but fun) and their mai tai is absolutely divine!

I love Joe! He is a sweet little man with a great vision. All of his restaurants are terrific and this one is no exception. Granted, I have only been here once (Its kinda far out there and I live in the Copa) but the one time I went was a great experience. I had some kind of chicken pesto sammich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was very tasty I think mainly because of the flavorful pesto that was on it. The sweet potato fries were good, however, since I am a sweet potato fries connoisseur, they were not the best I have had. However, they give you a mango salsa that does with them and that was pretty legit. Also got to try their BBQ chicken pizza. It was good but I think I am starting to lean toward not being a fan of BBQ pizza, the sauce it just too much for me on a pizza. Anyways. service was good and I loved the atmosphere outside. The inside could use a little sprucing up and I can see why people dont usually eat in there. But I love the outside and feeling like I am having a picnic in the woods with gourmet food. Way to go Joe on another successful venture, YOU ROCK!

I was pleasantly surprised with this place. All the people that mentioned it to me were LDS and I am not so I wasn't sure what to expect from "good clean comedy." My husband and I actually went with an LDS couple on a double date (see, we don't hate!) and they chose this place. Otherwise, we most likely would not have come here on our own. Anyways, I was stunned with some of the ingenious things the Improv group came up with. Honestly was cracking up almost the entire time with the exception of when the one and only girl was up. She was not funny at all. However, there was a guy with blonde hair and glasses that was hilarious! Anyways, I loved this place and would definitely go again. Whats also nice is that its only 12.00 which is quite a difference from the Improv where you pay 20.00 usually for the tickets and have to buy 2 items each as well. Don't get me wrong, I do love the Improv but if you are looking for cheaper and cleaner comedy, then this is your place.

I love Claim Jumper and I don't care who knows. Yes, its a chain but who the hell cares. The food is always good, heaping portions, the atmosphere is fun, service has always been dead on, and the prices are decent. A lot of people are saying that claim jumper is expensive but I don't think it is at all. Most of the dishes are 15.00 or under and are massive though over 1500 calories each. You could definitely share a dish with another person and walk away for less than 20.00 with a nice down home comfort meal in both of your bellies. I think overpriced is when places charge more than 20.00 a meal which lets face it, is pretty typical now a days at a restaurant serving the type of food Claim Jumper does. Now that I have proven my point, I will list what I have tried, all of which are amazing:  - Turkey supper - Make sure you get extra gravy though. Their mashed potatoes are very good though chunkier than some people would like. The stuffing is pretty legit as well but what I like most about this meal is the roasted veggies (I'm not really a veggie fan but these are unbelievable, I could eat a whole plate of them by themselves), and the cranberry jelly. Ummmm thanksgiving!!! - Cashew chicken salad sammich or BBQ chicken sammich - Both are delicious & huge. I always order with a side salad with ranch. Pretty big & cornbread croutons so good. The baked tomato herb bread is what makes these!!! - Ponzu glazed salmon with coconut rice, papaya salsa, and grilled bok choy - This was one of their summer specials and I really hope it comes back next summer because it was honestly one of the best salmon dishes Ive ever had from a restaurant. If you are a salmon person and they have this again, you must try it! - Goldrush chicken - OMG, this is sooooooo good. Do not order if you are trying to watch your weight though. Haha. The hubby gets every time he comes here and is absolutely in love with it more than I think hes in love with me. I will agree, its divine! - Chicken fried steak - This is probably my least favorite thing here and I will tell you why. Although the taste is great, its too fricken big!!! So you sit and eat and eat and eat this bohemith fried chicken/ steak and you make yourself miserable in the process. Yes you do that with almost all their meals, but this one always makes me feel the most horrible after the fact. This is definitely one that you either need to order the lighter portion or share with someone. Otherwise, you will seriously be burnt out on anything fried for months. - Giant stuffed baker - These potatoes are seriously the size of my husbands foot and that is pretty massive. Yes, he is known as fricken big foot in our house! Anyways, I made the mistake one time of thinking I would try to "eat light" at Claim Jumper. Let me just tell you, there is no such thing. I ordered a half a sammich with a salad off the lunch menu and was told that it came with a baked potato. This turned out to be a meal fit for the entire town of Guadalupe!!! OMG, fricken huge!!!! The potato was great though, it came with all the fix-ens at that time: cheese sauce, bacon, sour cream, butter, you name it! - French onion soup - Just tried this last night and the husband and I agreed that it was extremely flavorful and rich. Definitely one of the better french onion soups I have had. Lots of oozy cheese!  And lastly, yes I have miraculously managed to try a few of their desserts although I am not sure how. This was definitely when I was at my fattest!  - I declare it eclair cake - So I was here one night for just dessert with my hub and the in laws. I was going to get the chocolate chip calzone but they said it would take awhile. So I decided on the "I Declare it" thinking it probably wouldn't be very big because lets face it, how fricken big can an eclair be? The hub and his dad went to use the rest room and on the way back, got a glimpse of my cake. It was the second to the largest right next to the motherlode chocolate cake. I was beyond scared when they told me this! Then it arrived and they were not lying. It was massive! The thing that I noticed though was that although it appears huge, its really just the 12 scoops of ice cream under the eclair that make it gargantuan. So I basically just ate the eclair with whipped cream, hot fudge and maybe one scoop of ice cream. I would advise anyone else who gets this to do the same! - Jumpers mud pie with Oreo ice cream - We split this between 3 of us and it was still way too much sweet for one night. This is mainly all ice cream. I am sensing a theme with the Claim Jumper Desserts? Anyways, I was not overly impressed because I like a little more substance then just ice cream. - Brownie Finale - Just like every other brownie sundae out there but beyond better! The brownie is of course on steroids but its moist, chocolaty and just downright delicious. Best brownie I have had! Split this between 3 people as well and I felt like a fricken heffer when I was done   :(   Very good

See my other review under the other Claim Jumper link. I went to the 5001 word mark with that one so I couldn't add a couple of helpful tips, haha. Everything is great here pretty much but I will admit that I am not a fan of their biscuits and don't  understand why they get so much praise. To me, they are dry, lacking in flavor, and hard. The guy that posted the pic of the spoon sticking out of one is my idol and I completely agree. Also, if you are trying to watch what you eat and you happen to end up here obviously because of someone else suggestion, you can determine what is healthy by looking at the back of their drinks/ desserts booklets that are on the tables. There are nutrition facts on everything on the menu in this book! Although kinda depressing, this will help you determine the healthiest items. Good luck finding something under 500 calories though!

Finally got to try the bread pudding  here and it was unbelievable. Not as unbelievable as Charlestons but is definitely making the list for "Best Bread puddings" (see list).   Also tried the tuna sammich with avocado as I wanted something simple. That tomato herb bread that they use is extraordinary! The sammich was great just like everything else I have had here.

I absolutely loved Binions. My friend was having a major jonsing for a good steak and we were looking for a place that was a little more reasonable then some of the Ruth Chris type places that are located all over the strip. Decided to try Fremont since we planned on hanging there later that night. I thought back to "The Hungry Detective" on the Food Network and remembered him going here. Binions was a place I was also wanting to try for a long time. We arrived and there was no wait. We were seated right by a window with a fabulous view of the strip and Fremont. You can't get that view at too many places. The atmosphere was kinda cool, like an old school steak house where Frank SInatra and all the old schoolers would have hanged back in the day. Our waiter was terrific also, very attentive and friendly. Now on to the food, the only complaint is that there were no appetizers that didn't have seafood in them it seemed. My friend is not a fan of seafood and so she was kinda bummed. We both ordered the petite filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Since the menu said you could choose sauces, we figured why not and I chose the Bearnaise and she chose the peppercorn. I was actually very pleased that I could add on a sauce because I honestly don't like to have a steak without some kinda sauce. I love Bearnaise on steak but when I really don't feel like making it, I will just use BBQ sauce. Weird I know, but I have been eating it this way since I was a little girl. I guess when it boils down to it, I am not a huge steak person. I do like a good cut of meat but I never get super excited about it. Anyways, the filet was actually significantly larger than I expected. Honestly, it was the best steak I have ever had in my life! Like I said, not usually a huge steak person so I normally will only eat about half of a filet. However, I ate the entire steak presented to me along with the potatoes which were silky smooth and very flavorful/ well seasoned and the entire bunch of perfectly cooked green beans. My friend hates veggies but she continued to eat the green beans saying that she liked them alot. Did I mention that I ordered my steak medium and this was the first place I have ever been too that cooked it exactly medium? Every other place I have been doesn't know how to cook a steak but this is the exception. The Bernaise was delicious and my friend loved the peppercorn sauce, but honestly, the steaks didn't need the sauces. The meat could hold up on its own (Gosh, never thought I would be saying that!).  Everything from the bread to the meal to the bottle of white zin we ordered was so fabulous that we felt that dessert needed to be ordered, no option, it had to be done! So we ordered the tiramisu to split. Its hard to find a good tiramisu where you can really taste the coffee. This was not only a good tiramisu, it was a great tiramisu. Perfectly moist and had very much the coffee flavor you expect.  Needless to say, we walked away not only feeling satisfied but extremely giddy about the meal we had just devoured.  Binions is terrific in every aspect of the word: Great value for Vegas (how many other upscale steakhouses in Vegas give you fresh hot bread, bottled water, steak, potato and veggie for an affordable price?), great ambiance, and absolutely amazing food! The next trip to Vegas will definitely include a dinner at Binions!  PS: When looking for parking, there is a parking garage where Binions will Validate for up to 3 hours I believe and it is under the hotel if I remember right. When entering the hotel, I would recommend going onto Fremont Street and entering from there. Otherwise, you will walk into a nearly empty poker room that is just depressing and pathetic. That happened to us. It was literally one of those moments where you open the door and everyone stairs at you. Kinda Freaky. I remember thinking that Binions must have really lost its appeal and had hardly any clientele, however, I realized that the other side closest to Fremont street is actually the jumpin part.    ;) One final thing, someone was celebrating a birfday in the next room, and a group was singing Happy Birthday to them. It was the most depressing Happy Birthday I have ever heard. Everyone singing sounded like they wanted to die. Now I am not sure if that was the waitstaff or just the group at the table but it was the most pathetic rendition of Happy Birthday I have ever heard. if that was the waitstaff, they should be ashamed of themselves and step up their games. It was so bad that all the other tables around us including us were all making wisecracks about it. Haha

Yes this is a chain but after traveling in Maui for a week and then coming back home to Kahlua Pork from Rumbi, I can honestly say that the Kahlua pork here is better than any of the places I ate it at in Hawaii. Crazy huh? The Kahlua pork at Rumbi is so moist and tender and when its paired with some of their magnificent teriyaki sauce and Rumbi rice (rice cooked with coconut milk and beans), it is out of this world. The Kahlua pork plate at Rumbi has lately been the first meal that comes to mind when I want comfort food. This is a bit of a problem cause that is normally on a work day during lunch and after eating a meal of pork, rice, mac salad, and coleslaw, I am just down right exhausted and in dire need of a nap.  I used to come here quite frequently but forgot about this place and I am not sure why. Besides the Kahlua pork and Rumbi rice, I can say that their mac salad, sweet potato fries, and their beach burger are really good as well. If you are looking for something different, yet tasty and satisfying, try Rumbi. I think you will enjoy it.

If I could give YC's 3 1/2 stars, that would be what I would rate them. I am torn on them being just ok or me being a fan. On one hand, they are a great value because you get alot for what you pay. The small bowl is a ton of food since you put as much meat, noodles, and veggies in it as you want (a tip, keep adding and smashing it down cause it does shrink when they cook it up). The food taste good most of the time if you order the right sauce. They have so many different kinds of sauces that you can concoct, however, I feel like most taste the same. There are really two flavors: good and not so good. The not so good are the ones that are supposed to have a sweet and sour flavor and the good ones have more of a teriyaki flavor. You can get as much rice, fried wontons, and soup as you want. So your meal plus all this for about 8.00 and you can get a box for an extra 25 cents I believe. With all the food you get, its more than enough to last you for 2 meals. This is a decent place if you like good value and ok food.

Used to come here all the time for dinner when I attended school at UOFP right across the parking lot. A little overpriced but a good little place for soup and panini's. My favorites were the Adobe panini, roma panini, Corn and green chili bisque (especially good with the Adobe panini to dip), and the broccolli cheese soup. Their potato salad is pretty good as well. Another negative besides the prices is that service is slow. However, I can say that the food it very tasty, the atmosphere is cute and quaint, and the pickles are indeed spicy   :O

Cantina Laredo was not very good. I did feel that it was a little pricey as well. I went here with my boss to check out their banquet room and try some of their food for an upcoming vendor conference our company is having. The atmosphere is very nice and modern. The service was great. We ordered the botanas platter to share which came with tacos al pastor, chicken fajita quesadillas, chili con queso, Guacamole, stuffed jalapenos, and beef, shrimp and vegetable skewers. Nothing really wowed me though. The best thing on the platter was probably the stuffed jalapenos but you only got two and they were pretty small. The tacos were kinda dry and bland as were the quesadillas, and the skewers had only one shrimp and one tough piece of beef on them. I thought it was kinda a rip off. The queso was ok but tasted like your typical Velveeta cheese dip. In addition, we ordered a cup each of the sopa de tortilla. Trying to be fancy, the waiter arrived with two bowls of tortilla strips, chicken, and onions. Then he poured the thick soups table-side. Yippy. I really wasn't impressed. Table-side anything is just stupid and useless in my opinion. The soup really was not very good. Was a bit too pungent in flavor and smell. Almost tasted like a bowl of enchilada sauce. Needless to say, my boss and I didn't eat very much of it. Even the complimentary chips and salsa were not that great. The warm roasted poblano salsa was terrible I thought and the other salsa was mediocre. I had very high hopes for this restaurant and was disappointed immensely. On a positive note, they do have a great banquet room that can hold up to 50 people and it has LCD TVs and surround sound so its great for presentations and corporate events. Would I try it again? I am all about giving places second chances so I would go again and try ordering an actual meal. If it sucks again, I will conclude that this place is overpriced, crappy, and not worth anymore of my time.

I had never been to an H&M before but I was so mesmerized by this particular one in Caesars as I ate my brunch at Max Brenner. I told my friend during brunch that I would like to see what that store had to offer. Can I just say that this particular location had 3 stories of wonderfulness to offer! The place was fricken huge! Although I didn't buy anything, I still had a blast looking at all the clothes, funky shoes, and accessories. Also crazy was that there was a live DJ on his own little balcony on the 2nd floor spinning music!!! This was by far one of the biggest stores I had ever been to and the prices were really cheap! There were a couple of negatives though: their sizes are European so be prepared to have to try stuff on if you don't know what your European size is, the lines for the cashiers were also a bit long. These two issues actually were blessings for me because I did see some things I wanted to buy but decided against it since I didn't want to try anything on or wait in long lines. I would still say though that if you are having a shopping spree and have money to burn in Vegas, the forum shops at Vegas is your place and the H&M shop there is a must!

I don't get why there are so many haters of Benihana! If you are looking for good teppanyaki japanese cooking, this is a very good place for it. I have tried many things here but you know what they don't get enough credit for? Their sushi! The Vegas roll at Benihana is the best vegas roll I have ever had and might actually be my favorite sushi roll ever! Now, onto their regular food, I have tried many menu items and all have been good. That includes: teriyaki steak, hibachi chicken, hibachi shrimp, spicy hibachi chicken, and colossal mango shrimp. However, the best dishes I ordered here in addition to their Vegas Roll are the yakisoba and the hibachi scallops. These are both delicious and some of the better values on the menu I felt. The fried rice is 1.25 more to add on and although tasty, I don't feel that its worth it to pay extra. It is fun to watch them make it though. Here's the weird thing: my favorite part of the meal (next to the Vegas roll) is their vegi's. The zucchini and onions taste sooo good with all the butter in them!!! Of course, everything is better with butter! Another good thing about the meals is you get soup and salad so you feel like the price is a little more reasonable. The soup is very brothy but has a great onion flavor to it. The salad on the other hand has a ginger dressing that I am not a fan of. All in all, benihana, although a little overpriced, has some terrific food and its a great place to take a date. The show the chefs put on it very fun, however, it doesnt change much from chef to chef if you have been more than once. Oh one other understated item: their tempura banana's for dessert. Delectable! Everyone should try Benihana and their dam Vegas Roll at least once in their lives. A final tip: If you expect great service, do not sit in the bar to have dinner. We made the mistake of doing that once and had to wait forever for everything! Sit at the tables if you are planning to have more than drinks. WORD!

I give this place 5 stars because I don't know of any other places with good Philly cheese steak sammiches. Their cheese steak with whiz is great as is the chicken Reuben cheese steak. There is also a good amount of meat in their sandwiches and the bread is soft and fresh. I personally think the regular size is enough for me. I love their fry sauce and their sweet potato fries. Their regular fries are not anything to get excited about though. Prices are decent and the service is quick as well

Overcrowded and not even last years styles, more like styles from 2-3 years ago. Every purse here was really basic and not appealing. For me that is. I guess if you like simple and plain coach bags, this might be the place for you. Yes the prices are lower than the actual coach stores, however, they are still 100.00 to 200.00 per purse depending on what you choose. To me, that is not a big enough discount to warrant buying such boring purses. I guess you can call me cheap but I would rather pay less and have a stylish purse that might fall apart within a year or pay about a hundred dollars more (300.00) and go to a normal coach store and get a purse I love that apparently also is of a better quality. Not only that, this outlet store doesnt have nearly enough employees for the amount of people that visit here. If I had even had a question, there is no way I would have had it answered. It was weird because at the Coach store at Ceasars, the sales girl was a little too attentive and came off as fake. Yet, at the outlet store, the sale people could have cared less and seemed almost rude probably from being overworked and stressed out. Honestly, I was initially excited to visit here but walked out disappointed. This outlet store was not only an unpleasant shopping experience but it also didnt seem like a real great deal price wise to me. Yes, I cringe thinking about spending 300.00 at a real Coach store, however, it seems a little more worth it then still paying alot and buying something that I am really not that happy with at the Outlet all for the sake of having a Coach purse.

Charlestons has got to be by far one of my favorite restaurants. First of all, its not very expesive but gives the illusion of a high class nicer restaurant. The service is impeccable and the staff really does care about the customer. They will comp a meal if they can tell someone is not happy with it. They also work as a team so your drink glasses never go empty. I also love the fact that I have never had to experience screaming kids. For some reason, I think people don't consider this a kid friendly restaurant which is fine with me!  But my favorite thing about Charlestons is definately the food!!! I am absolutely in love with the Walt's Champaign chicken salad and their croissants with honey drizzle are incredible! I have tried several other dishes here so here are my other recommendations:    Chicken salad sandwich - huge and just a downright good sammich, Chicken club salad - This is the hubs fav salad. Totally a man's salad with fried chicken, bacon, avocado, cheese, and make sure to order with lots of ranch dressing to clog your arteries even further Rigatony Bolognese - For not being an italian restaurant, this dish was still amazing. Creamy and a little spicy. Huge portion also Over Roasted Chicken - One of the best chicken dishes Ive ever had! Order with the mashed potatoes (very good consistency and flavor) and the baked beans (dip the chicken in the beans... crazy but sooooo good) Prime Rib with mashed potatoes - Ive have never had their prime rib but the hub says its one of the best he has had and is consistently well trimmed and has had good flavor each time he's ordered it.   A few other things worthy of mention:  Maryland crab cakes (full of crab and the apple relish served with it is fresh and a really good accompanyment), and the creamy chicken noodle soup (only served one day a week but this is the best chicken noodle soup Ive ever had and I really dont like chicken noodle soup! I would eat this shit even when I am not sick!)  And the last, most important thing to remember if you go to Charlestons: YOU MUST ORDER THE BREAD PUDDING!!! Yes yes, I saved the best for last. This bread pudding is the best bread pudding you will ever have. I have converted many a bread pudding hater (myself included) with this bread pudding. Haha. Take my advise and you will be glad you did. I expect a thank you!!!!  So to sum it up, Charlestons may be a chain restaurant but I believe its one of the best chains out there. Every time I eat there, I am content with the overall experience. Try this restaurant and their bread pudding and you will not be sorry!

My husband and I went here on a recommendation from someone who is more into the fine dining type places. Her other recommendations have not been that great but since someone else told me this place was good as well, we decided to try it. I have to admit, I didn't have high hopes though. Boy was I wrong!!! I really enjoyed Maria Maria. My husband seemed to enjoy it as well although he felt it was a little more pricey than other mexican influenced places.  The atmosphere was really nice and the service was great. Our waiter was attentive and did a great job of recommending certain dishes and describing what was in them.  We opted for the street taco sampler for our appetizer (street taco's with steak, chicken, and carnitas). The carnitas were the best!!! My husband was amazed by them. For dinner, I chose the carnitas chili relleno and boy am I glad I did. It was amazing and the beans and rice it was served with were great as well. So much flavor. The sauce that was around the relleno was awesome as well and I was surprised it could taste that good having carrot and cinnamon in it! My husband decided on the beef chivichanga (same as a chimichanga, I was told they used to bake them, hence the name change but that didn't work out well so they started frying them). He said it was ok but I know he wished he had ordered what I got. Luckily, the portion was so large for me that he got to eat half of mine :)   We also ordered a side of the fried plantains, something I had never had. They were wonderful and the cheese on them put them over the top! The chips and salsa served pre meal were good as well. We loved the green and the regular salsa the most. The orange smoky one was ok but not my kinda salsa. I would say that their regular salsa was some of the best I have ever had! All in all, the food exceeded our expectations and the portions were bigger than we thought as well. Also the prices were not unreasonable. Yes, 17.00 for a relleno is a little high, but it was worth it considering it is one of the best rellenos I have ever had! The hubs chivichanga was only 12.00 which wasn't bad.  Another nice thing was the music. Even before the live music started, classic rock hits were played which is our type of music. The live music was really nice as well. The hub loves Latin acoustic music.  All in all, the meal was almost outstanding. About the only thing I wasn't a fan of was the red sangria. Most people will probably think I am crazy but I felt it was too strong. I thought sangria was supposed to be a little sweet and mine was not that way at all. Other than that, the overall experience was great. We will definitely go back!

I recently became a huge sushi fan with this place and Ra being my favorites. Blue Wasabi is so different from other sushi joints including Ra in that their rolls are very untraditional but very yummy. I go here quite often and always try to get something new. Here are my personal favs:  Rolls: Get Clucked (or the clucker as my friends and I like to call it) - Fried chicken and avocado with a sweet chili sauce, does it get any better? Non sushi people will love this roll Surf and Turf - Fried shrimp with pineapple salsa. Soooo good. Another non sushi persons roll Dam Jumper - Wrapped in salmon, no rice at all in this roll. Kinda spicy. Different but very good. You might not likie if you are not into raw fish though. Marco Rolo - Kinda has an italian flavor to it but it is a really nice combo in a roll. Another sushi haters roll Rainbow roll California Roll - How could you go wrong?  Side note: Although the PITA roll taste good, it is a difficult roll to pick up with chopstix without it falling apart. So if you are not good with stix, you might not wanna get this one.  Martini's: Lemon Raspberry Ice - The best Martini I have had here Grape Escape - Taste like Grape Coolaid with a kick! Key West Martini - A good dessert drink. Creamy and taste like key lime pie. I love the graham cracker crumbs around the rim  Other food: Fried Pizza rolls - These are surprisingly good. A good choice for kids (even though I really dont think you should bring kids to any restaurant).  Pork Pot stickers Buddha Burgers - The meat in these tastes like quality beef, almost as good as Kobe beef. Not sure what kind of meat it was. The sweet potato fries are awesome!  To sum it up, this place has alot of options for everyone. If you are not a sushi lover, you can still have sushi rolls that you will probably like. A little tip: if you hate seaweed which is in most rolls, you can substitute it with rice paper. The service has always been good every time I have gone here. The price is a little high though not any higher than I have seen at other sushi places included Ra. Try this place, you will love it!

RA is definately one of my favorite Sushi restaurants in AZ. They have great sushi rolls, drinks, and appetizers for non sushi lovers. My favorite rolls are: beef tataki roll (No fish for the non sushi person), lobster mango roll, shrimp tempura roll, and the rainbow roll. Make sure you get the creamy wasabi sauce (comes with the beef tataki roll) or the creamy ponzu sauce (make sure you tell them it comes with the tunacado roll so they get the right sauce) to go with your sushi. These two sauces are amazing! For appetizers, their lobster spring rolls are pretty legit as are their gyoza and calamari. The calamari is always cooked perfect and the mango dipping sauce for the spring rolls is awesome! Ive also tried their pineapple cream cheese wontons and their crab cakes and they were ok though nothing special. For drinks, they have many flavored saki's and specialty drinks that are very good. My fav drinks at RA are the mango margarita, blushing geisha, and the cosmopolitan that are all on their regular happy hour menu and the "sheso naughty" which is on  their Wednesday night hump day happy hour menu. Yes on Wednesday, if you go after 8, there are certain appetizers, drinks and sushi rolls that are half off as well. So if you go for regular happy hour, then hold off on ordering anything from 7-8, then you get double happy hour! Regular happy hour is during 3-7 pm every day (including weekends) and its half off certain appetizers, rolls, and drinks. Its a great value! Ive walked away after having 3 drinks, appetizer, and roll for less than 30.00! If you have room, try the tempura ice cream. It is cinnamon ice cream with tempura batter and deep fried, with raspberry sauce drizzled over it. AMAZING!

For the person that said this location was closed, I am positive it's still open. I think you are thinking of the one on Ray and McClintock. Anyways, I know this isnt exactly fancy dining but I saw another person review it and I couldn't stand by and not have a word on this place. EPL is cheap and delicious, two things I love in a meal!!! Ive tried numerous items on the menu and almost all have been delightful. My favs are the pollo bowl with flour tortillas, the chicken tostada salad, and the chicken with a couple of sides. Their tortillas are really good, soft and warm. If you are going to get their sides, get either the pinto beans, mac and cheese, rice, or corn. I had the coleslaw a long time and remember it being dry and flavorless. Their churros are really good as well if you are looking for something cheap and sweet. Additionally, they have a salsa bar and all of the salsa's are very tasty. I especially love their house salsa and the verde avocado salsa. Other entree items that are good are the chicken taco's (though pretty greasy) and the green chili quesadilla. An item not worth getting: the classic chicken burrito. Kinda dry and sad. Haha. Anyways, if you have not tried EPL, you must!!! Its not at all like KFC and the food is fresh and delicious.

Since I just did my not so great review of Texass Roadhouse and mentioned Logan's a lot, I felt it only fitting to do a review on Logans. First things first, I love that Logan's has a health nuts menu that tells you lighter items to order. This is great for the unlikely instances that I am trying to eat healthy. So when you go to Logan's, they give you a basket of rolls with regular butter. Call me crazy but these are way better than Texas's and I personally like regular butter over cinnamon butter. I have never had anything bad at Logan's as far as entrées. The porkies are one of my favorites. They are little pulled pork sliders served on their delicious rolls. When its on the rolls, how can you go wrong?!? The pork is always very tender and flavorful and I love the slaw that they put on top. If you are more into regular sliders, their roadies are good but the meat has been a bit overcooked a few times when Ive had them. You will never have that issue though with the porkies. Their dressings on their salads don't taste bottled and the salads are a good abundance of lettuce, vegis, and egg, cheese, bacon. For entrées, their southwest BBQ chicken is good but my personal favorite here is actually the Santa Fe Tilapia. When I have had this, the fish was cooked perfectly and the chipotle sauce mixed with the corn relish was phenominal. You wont find entrées like this at Texas. That is why I love Logans, they have simple items but also kick it up a notch which is something that Texass does not do. I have had many of their sides and all have been good: Loaded sweet potato, sweet potato fries (Yes!), rockin onion petals, coleslaw, and mac and cheese (Score! creamy and satisfying). See what I mean about adding a little shizzzzam to their menu, you wont find sides like this at Texass Roadhouse.  Each time I have come here, have gotten right in or hardly had to wait at all. The service is always good. Oh and make sure before you leave to ask for a few rolls in to go. I asked for some for my husband and was shocked when they gave me a huge box full of rolls with butter. it was great.  Logans, you are the best roadhouse!

Discovered that their Caesar salad is pretty dang good and the Logans Tea's are a great value for if you wanna get knocked on your ass. Made with Everclear and several other liquors, I was told that they can only serve you two before you are cut off. I had the blue one and it was really good although i did order it sans the Everclear.

Came here late on a Saturday night with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. Was so packed that most of our party had to stand, could barely move, and couldn't hear each other. The waitress was not very friendly and the drinks were not that great. My friend paid for me so I am not sure what the drink prices were like. Hubby also said he saw a few people actually smoking inside. Isn't there an ordinance for that? Needless to say, not my kind of place so we had 1 drink, paid, and went next door to San Tan Brewery. If you like loud, overly crowded bars with bad service, then maybe this is your place.

I was afraid that maybe this place wouldnt be that great but I actually really liked it. I booked a table for a bachelorette party I was hosting. Never having gone here, I was not sure what to expect and if this would be a great place to have some drinks, good times, and get a little rowdy. It turned out to be the perfect place. Our waiter was cute and fun, the atmosphere was really nice yet casual. Next time, we will have to sit on their beautiful patio. And the food and drinks, unbelievable! Sure, its not traditional mexican food that you would find at some of the smaller joints in town and was a little higher in price, but it still tasted very good and the portions were still big enough that most of us didnt finish. In addition to chips and salsa (which were complimentary), we ordered some guacamole. I would say this was some of the best guac I have had and my friends loved it too. The salsa and chips were great as well with the salsa having excellent flavor and the chips being thick and crunchy. My friends ordered the pork taco's and ceviche while I opted for the beef short rib enchiladas. The girls loved the tacos and ceviche! Having tasted the ceviche, I concur that it was amazing. My enchilada's were very good as well with the enchilada sauce being very tasty and the meat was really tender and had a great flavor. The rice and beans that accompanied the entrees were ok though nothing really special. The rice was basically buttered rice which of course I like but we all felt it didnt belong with such a magnificent meal. What they should have served was more of the carrot cilantro salad that was on the plate as a garnish. Now this stuff was beyond amazing even though I have no idea what it was! For drinks, we all had different drinks. My friends loved their traditional margaritas, pomegranite grapefruit margarita, and cucumber fresca. I decided on the white peach and hibiscus margarita and although sweet, I couldnt stop drinking them! Cap the night off with some of their flan (which the waiter brought complimentary) and shots of patron tequila and we were happy campers. Im not usually a flan fan but this flan was really good and almost had the consistency of a cheesecake. and patron, well you know patron. All in all, my friends were extremely happy with the restaurant and it was a great start to a really fun and crazy evening.

I think I became a bigger fan of this place after trying their shrimp and crab ceviche. Simply amazing!!!! I could order bowls of this stuff (something I think I do during their happy hour since its half off) and be content with that. Their shortrib cheese crisp with avocados was equally as delish. Great flavor to the short ribs. Had their guacamole and it was wonderful again, seems to be pretty consistent. Same thing with their white peach hibiscus margarita. I could literally drink 10 of these things which will get me into trouble at some point I am sure. Blanco has great food and fun atmosphere with a hip and trendy vibe. Even the hubby enjoyed the food even though this is not his type of place. Try it, you will be a fan too   :)

There really arn't any other teriyaki places around that can compete with Yogis plus the food is pretty dang good. Hence the 5 stars. My favorite thing to get is the regular Arizona bowl. It has crabmeat, cucumber, avocado, teriyaki sauce, and rice so its pretty light but filling. Ive also tried their chicken teriyaki (large) and it was good but the large is fricken HUGE! Their yakisoba is pretty good and so are their pork gyoza. Though I have never tried it, I have heard that the spicy teriyaki sauce is great. I like the fact that when you eat there, you can get as much teriyaki sauce from the dispenser as you want. The prices are not bad for the amount of food you get.

I have been to Gordon Biersch 3 times now. I have had their sliders, garlic fries, south western eggs rolls, lobster bisque, and tapas. I will say the only thing I was not a fan of was the lobster bisque. I am very particular when it comes to soups and I like soups that are chunky, not ones that are just broth or soups that have been pureed. The lobster bisque had no chunks of lobster and no lobster flavor. So tell me why they call it lobster bisque? I dunno. Anyways, this is kinda like an Applebees or Chilis but a little more upscale and trendier. Same kinda food though, american bar food. So I wouldn't come here and order some kind of fancy pasta, seafood and probably wouldn't order a steak. But the apps, sammiches, and drinks are pretty tasty. Oh yeah, drinks. I have had a beer flight and it was ok. I'm not a big beer drinker. If you are though, the beer flight is a fantastic option to figure out what their best brew is. One drink I am a fan of from Gordon Biersch is the pomegranite mojito. I could drink 10 of these things and not think twice till after I am hugging the porcelain goddess. Haha. They are really fruity and smooth. Great girly drink! Go here is you are looking for a good happy hour or after work location to have a few drinks and bites with friends   :)

Scramble = awesome in my book. Met a friend for brunch one day and ordered the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict. I am a huge Benedict fan and am always in search of the newest most original best eggs Benedict and for right now, Scramble serves it. The Santa Fe eggs Benedict features jalapeno cornbread, ham, poached eggs and chipotle hollendaise. Whoever thought to use jalapeno cornbread (they are more like sweet corn cakes) is a fricken genius! The sweetness of the cornbread/ cake cuts through the saltiness of the ham and then there is a slight spiciness from the hollendaise. So many flavors going around in your mouth!!! Absolutely spectacular. It came with country potatoes which were decent but I liked eating them with the Benedict, together, as one   :)    Scramble is now one of my breakfast spots due to this one eggs Benedict which is the only thing I have tried there. I like the walk up order concept and the modern simple atmosphere works perfectly fine for me. They also allow dogs on the patio which gets me kinda excited to bring one of my little ones (dogs) here! The one bummer is that it is pretty far away from me. The drive from Maricopa out to Squaw Peak which is kinda the general area is about an hour. However, that wont stop me from coming back!

By far the best tuna sammich I have ever had! I don't know what they do to make a simple tuna sammich so addicting but its a problem for my waistline. I tell myself though that tuna is healthy so it cancels out all the mayo. Whatever makes me feel better, right? Their turkey cranberry sammich is very good as well and can be somewhat decent for you if you get it with no mayo. Paradise makes great pasta salads and soups as well. I am in love with their Paradise pasta salad. The Greek pasta salad is also delicious as is the seafood pasta salad. Make sure you get a small bowl of the seafood pasta salad because it has alot of mayo in it and can be a bit overpowering unless you like to eat mayo as a meal. For soups, I love the low fat tortilla soup. Its brothy but has an excellent flavor and I can feel good about eating it. Make sure you get the roll that is supposed to come with it. Its soft and a good accompaniment. I have also tried their roasted tomato soup which is very tasty as well. As for their salads, I'm a fan of their BBQ chicken salad. Lastly, the one reason you much try Paradise bakery is their cookies, particularly the chocolate chip. These come with all sammiches which makes me very happy. The lemon zester cookies are amazing as well and not too lemony/ tart. If you are looking for a bakery to get cookies or sweets from, this is actually one of the lower priced places to go. I got a dozen to have in the hotel room for a bachelorette party and they were only 8.00 whereas other bakery's wanted to charge like 15.00. Not a bad price in my book for cookies. However, I did mark a star off because all their other food (sammiches, salads, and soups) are a bit overpriced. To get a whole sammich with a cup of soup (no drink), its 12.00!!! That's a bit steep to me considering that their sammiches are not that big. I still come here though because their tuna is just that good!

Tried their chicken and wild rice soup and it was delicious! If they have it, you must try it! Their tuna was a little off this time, but I am thinking they had a new person preparing it or something. If its that way all the time, I will have to grade them down   :(

I don't  know if I would be as big a fan if I didnt live in the Copa but since this is one of the few restaurants out here, its a good choice if you don't wanna drive and want good ole American fatty food. I can honestly say though that they have the best sweet potato fries I have ever had. I would go here for these and these alone. Make sure to use the spicy ranch dressing that comes with them. Out of this world. In addition to the fries, I either order the turkey sueben with a side of thousand island or the chipotle mac mac. Most macs from restaurants are not good but this one is killer. Bacon in my mac? Yes please! And the soft pretzal they give you with it is great too. One thing Im a little upset about is that they had these honey mustard wings on special one night that were incredible. Now, you can't order them. Some of the best wings me and the hub have ever had so we are pissed. In any event, prices are cheap and the atmosphere is ok if you can get past most of the crazy, fat, one toothed maricopan ghouls that will be dining next to you.

This is definitely one of the better restaurants in the Copa. I have only been here for breakfast but I would recommend their breakfast to anyone. Not only is the menu large and sure to have something to please everyone, the food is actually tasty hearty. I have only had one bad instance at Sunrise and that was due to my eggs being a bit under-cooked for my liking. I realize that is bound to happen though when you order eggs over easy or sunny side up. ALWAYS ORDER SCRAMBLED OR OVER MEDIUM AT A RESTAURANT. Anyways, the service is always fast and friendly and the prices are awesome for the amount of food you get. Just make sure you get here before you get too hungry. The place is tiny so you may be waiting for a bit before sitting down to eat

Meh, thats really the first word that jumps into my mind when I think about my experiences at Toby Keiths. I went to the one in Vegas at the Harrahs Casino and it was ok, nothing special though. Very loud and crazy bar, at least that location is. Mesa location is a bit tamer but still kinda crazy. Food was typical bar food (burgers, fried food, etc) on both occasions (Vegas and this location), drinks were ok, service was fine both times. I can't really complain but this is not one of those places I would not choose to go to. Typical sports bar in my opinion. A couple of positives I can say is that they do make a hella good fried twinkie dessert and the waiters at the Mesa location are hilarious and a blast. Bottom line, this is one of those places you go to party, be loud and obnoxious. If you are looking for a quiet place with tasty terrific food, you will most likely not find it here.

There seem to be alot of people that swear by this place mainly because of the "no haggle" policy. However, I find that to be their biggest issue. I was looking to trade in an 09 Toyota Tacoma Pre-runner TRD and get into another car with a lower payment. I had done my research and found out the amount I could get for trade in which was $2,000.00 more than what I owed still on it. I decided to try CarMax for the fact that it seemed like a one stop shop and that it would be a fairly simple process. The salesman helping me was terrific, however, after the appraisal, I was informed they were going to give me $2,000 less than what I owed. Additionally, they wanted to sell me a used car, year '07, for way more than what it was worth and were going to give me a terrible interest rate (even though my credit is in the 800s). In my eyes, CarMax turned out to be a bad deal and there was no way of negotiating.  I was able to go to the Toyota dealership and get what I wanted on my trade in and also picked up a cute Nissan Cube for a really reasonable price and with an awesome interest rate. My advice: Only go to CarMax if you need to get rid of a car quick or if you have bad credit (I have several friends that were able to get a car from CM even though their credit is in the crapper). Otherwise, you can find a better deal elsewhere, haggle or not.

Finally went here to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate so I could compare it to Serendipities (see their review). Was only about 2.00 and tasted pretty much the same as the one at Serendipity. Don't waste your money at Serendipity. I also figured out the difference between a Chocolate milkshake and a frozen hot chocolate: The milk shake is made with milk, the frozen hot chocolate is not, its just ice and chocolate mix kinda like a chocolate slush. That's why you get more chocolate flavor in the Frozen Hot Chocolate.  Anyways, now about this Dunkin.... the service was not very friendly. Additionally, we came here around 1:00 on a Sunday and ordered some doughnuts along with the Frozen Hot Chocolate. Needless to say, the doughnuts were not fresh in the slightest. The hubby said they tasted like they had been sitting around since the day before. Needless to say, I was not very impressed and would rather go to Krispy Kreme for doughnuts and if I ever want coffee, I already know that Dutch Brothers is the best with really friendly service as well.

I have been here 3 times now trying to figure out if Penasco's should go in our restaurant rotation considering it is right down the street from where we live. The first time we came, I ordered an enchilada and shredded beef taco, beans, and papas. Having had Abuelos Papas, I was super excited and envisioned creamy potatoes with tons of cheesy goodness. The papas at Penascos are terrible I can honestly say. They didn't seem like they had any milk, cream or butter in them so they had a pasty texture and they were just bland. Very disappointing. The enchilada was forgettable. However, the rice was decent and at the time, the taco tasted very good. The chips and salsa were good as well and tasted different from other places salsa. The hub liked it too. My husband, however, was not impressed though when he got a chili relleno and it tasted fishy. He is not a big fan of fish and can tell when something has been contaminated by fish. So we waited awhile before trying it a second time. When we went back the second time, the salsa had changed although it was still really good. I got the two shredded beef tacos with rice and beans and was very satisfied with the meal. The hub got a chimichanga with ground beef and red sauce and he said it was very good. So at that time, we were happy with Penasco's. Cut to a week ago when we decided to go there for dinner. The chips and salsa were decent but not as good as I thought they would be based on other visits. I felt like the salsa was lacking something like spice and cilantro and the chips seemed like they had been sitting around all day. Then we ordered the same meals we ordered during the second visit. My taco's were soggy, not crispy, and the meat in them had no flavor at all. The hubs chimi just tasted off mainly because of the red sauce on top. In any event, everything was just mediocre. We decided that this place is too inconsistent and seems to be ok at best. I have stated this in one of my other reviews: there are other Mexican places we like much more so we will stick to those places instead. Mexican food is supposed to wow the senses and at Penasco's, there was much to be desired. Also, this place never seems to be busy so I wonder how much longer they will be open... I think people wanna like it because its really the only Mexican restaurant in the Copa, however, its just not that good.

Freddys has jumped into our weekly lunch rotation!!! I came here with a co-worker for the first time last week. Had the chili dog with fries. The dog was very good and their chili was amazing. Just the way I like it, no beans, but still chunky and the right amount of spice. I think I will definitely be getting a cup of chili the next time I come here. The fries were pretty good though very different. They were very very thin. I think these fries definitely live up to being shoestring potatoes. My co-worker has been looking for good Chicago dog but hasn't have much luck till now. Being from Chicago, she knows what a Chicago dog should be like. She said the one from Freddys was great! The only issue is that their dogs are a bit on the small side so I feel like I would have to order several to get full. I also gave Freddys four stars because I have not been able to try their namesake items (custard and steakburgers) to determine if they are really as good as it gets. Haha. But I will definitely be returning soon!

I finally tried their steak burger California style and it was very good. Tasted very fresh kinda like In and Out. I think I still might like In and Outs burgers better, however, Freddys still makes a mean chili dog! I can't quite give this place 5 stars though because I figured out last time that I really am not a fan of their fries. Everyone has their preferences of what fries should be and these are just not for me. Still have to try their custard. Service is great though and restaurant clean. Freddy's is still a winner in my book!

If you work in an office and have to dress business casual, NY & Co is your place to shop. Some of their stuff can be a bit plain but more often then not, they have modest, cute, stylish, business casual clothes at an affordable price. I don't think I have ever been bugged by a salesperson when coming to this store which is actually kinda nice. I can't stand salespeople following me around chiming in about how cute something is (see my review on Coach in LV). Lastly, they have a great display of accent jewelry which is my weakness. Everything is always really different and fun so I can't resist and usually walk out with several pieces. The next time you are trying to find a place to shop, try NY & Co. There is something for everybody   :)

One of the better burgers I have had from a fast food place. The veggies are always fresh and I love the "special sauce" aka thousand island. Just an all around good burger. Their fries are also great too. Made fresh and perfectly seasoned. The only thing I wish is that their burger patties were a little thicker...

YES!!!! THIS IS THE PLACE FOR BOOZEHOUNDS! I FRICKEN LOVE THIS PLACE! Seriously, if you are looking for a liquor store that has it all and has been "classified" so it doesn't look like your average on the corner hobo filled booze store, then you will love this place! Honestly, if you can't find something you like here, you are a horrible person that no one likes because you are too dang high maintenance. Haha. Every time I have come here, I have been able to find exactly what I needed (well not necessarily needed but I felt that I needed it at the time). The store is organized nicely so you can find everything easily and the clerks really seem to know their alcohol cause every time I have asked about something, they know what they are talking about. Even if what you want (you high maintenance people) is not sold in this 800+ meca of wines and beers, the clerks still seem like they would know what it is and why they don't have it. For instance, my step-mom wanted some wine she had sampled at Olive Garden a few weeks prior to us going there. She didn't know the name but the guy we spoke with there knew exactly what we were talking about and informed us that the supplier for OG was not yet selling that wine to total wine and more but they were working on getting it. He quickly suggested another wine they did have that was very close in taste. Wow, this guy's brain was like a vast empire of wine knowledge! Anyways, another great thing about this place is they are way cheaper than Bevho and they also have a bigger selection of mini liquors. This came in handy for the gift bags I made for a bachelorette party I was hosting which then came in handy for when the bars were closing down and we still wanted to get our drink on. So to wrap this up, if you are a boozer, alcoholic, boozehound, or just the average everyday citizen that likes to have a drink here or there from a flask (yes they have many of them!), this is the place for you! This place is like Disneyland for drunkards! Oh and they have wine tastings for the rich classy folks! Haha

A nice little shoe store. Not as overwhelming as DSW and not boring and ghetto like Famous Footwear. Nice layout with good organization: Wedges in one area, flats in another, tennys in another, etc. Affordable prices unlike DSW where shoes are still expensive simply because they are name brand even though they are marked down. I havnt purchased anything from the Carnival yet but its only a matter of time since they do have some really cute shoes. Overall, a very pleasant shopping experience at Shoe Carnival.   :)  A suggestion: To stick to the carnival theme, I think all the employees should have to dress as clowns!!! Haha JK

Cant remember exactly which location I went to but they are all over the fricken place it seems so I am sure they are about the same no matter the location. As one person put it, a PTs is a PTs is a PTs. Anyways, went to Vegas 4th of July weekend 2011 to visit a friend. We were going to see Ralphie May the night I got there so my friend took me to PT's for a bite to eat before the show since this place was close to the casino and it was supposed to be "fast." Although the waitress was nice, I am pretty sure she forgot about us after she dropped off our food cause we waited around forever for her to refill drinks and just to get our check. PTs is a smoking bar also so if you hate the smell of cigarette smoke, you should not come here. Also, because of this, children (under 18 that is) are not allowed in this bar/ restaurant.  No for the food, my friend ordered a chicken sammich which she said was really dry and the chicken was overcooked. I ordered the BLTA which was ok but the bread was toasted to the point of being difficult to bite into and it cut up the roof of my mouth. I was not impressed PT's is one of those places that is on every corner in LV it seems and I am not sure why. Maybe they have awesome drinks and drink specials or something because I can't honestly see how there would be such a demand to warrant having so many locations when judging by my experience, this place was crap. The extra star is simply because the atmosphere was clean, our waitress friendly (although still kinda sucky), big water cups so we didnt have to wait for as many refills, and I remember the fries being decent. Other than that, I don't think I will ever understand the appeal of PT's from investors willing to open so many freakin locations!

A good place if you want a decent burger. Wouldn't say it is the best burger I have ever had, however, it is tasty and hearty and the veggies (lettuce, tomato, etc) always taste fresh. I like that large amount of toppings to choose from. Prices are decent for what you get. A tip: I have heard that their regular burgers are huge so I always order the Jr burger and its more than enough. Also, the smalls fries are basically like a large at most other places so i don't even wanna picture what the large looks like. Atmosphere is clean and service is pretty quick. Like I said, a decent place for a burger in this neck of the woods.

I am all about trying new mexican restaurants since it is pretty much my favorite type of food. So I decided to try this new place that I had seen while shopping in Chandler. When we walked in on a Saturday afternoon, the restaurant was surprisingly close to empty. Not a very good sign considering that several other places that were in this building before had gone out of business. In any event, I was still excited after reading that they actually served you bean dip with your chips and salsa. Not too many other places do that. My excitement went down the drain when the bean dip came. It was greasy and resembled chili. The taste was not what I had expected. Needless to say, I didn't like it much. If you want great bean dip, go to Serranos! Theirs is amazing. However, the mild salsa was pretty good. For my meal, I decided to order the pork enchilada with ranchera sauce (the waiter said the ranchera sauce was great) with a pork tamale and rice and beans. The enchilada was ok but didnt have enough ranchero sauce. I like my mexican food to be smothered in sauce. GO BIG OR GO HOME! The tamale was nothing memorable. What also bothered me is the beans that were on the plate were exactly the same beans as the bean dip that I disliked. WTF? There is a difference between regular good ole refried beans and bean dip!!! The worst part about my meal is that there was a hair on the plate! The husband ordered a chimichanga with shredded beef. He said it was decent but was not happy with the tiny amount of sour cream and guac they gave him. They also pretty much piled lettuce on the plate. I understand most mexican places use lettuce as a garnish but this one had way too much. It looked like a salad topped with a chimichanga. To end our meal, the waiter brought us 2 complementary fruititas which were wonton wrappers filled with a mixture of fruit, deep fried and topped with sugar and cinnamon and accompanied by whipped cream to dip. These were the best part of the meal I would say. They were amazing. If I had to come back, I would just order these and these only!!!  So to wrap it up, El Palacio was ok, not good, not bad. The service was fine and the prices were decent. My issue is that there are sooo many other mexican places in the area that are great in my opinion. Therefore, I dont think I would return here unless someone else wanted to try it. I will just stick to Serrano's, Abuelos, El Charro or even McCayos.

Let me start by saying that I am usually a pretty forgiving person when it comes to restaurants. I really try to see the goods when there are bads and I will usually give a place a second chance since I understand that the wrong item is sometimes ordered. Yes, in a perfect world, every item on a restaurant menu should be amazing, but that simply is not the case. Anyways, I digress. This review is going to be pretty harsh because I honestly found nothing good about this place. Thank god I only came here because I had a gift card that needed to be used. I would have been pretty pissed if I actually had to pay for what we got. When entering CD, I was somewhat impressed with the décor. However, even though the seats look big and cozy, I did not find them to be that way at all. Also, the hostess was not overly friendly. She wasn't mean or anything but not friendly either. The hubby and I decided to order the pretzels and fondue that everyone else raves about. It was ok. The pretzels were soft but most were not hot, and the fondue was simply ok in my opinion. For entrees, I decided on the sweet corn cannelloni while the hubby chose the fried chicken. I would also like to add that hubby was going to order the 36 hour ribs believing they would be fall off the bone, what with cooking for that long. The waitress was actually considerate and thoughtful enough to let him know that since they were not babybacks, these ribs were not going to be fall off the bone and most past customers actually felt they were a bit tough. After that information, he decided to retreat and order the chicken instead.  The entrée portions were actually larger than we had expected. However, neither entrée was impressive. My "cannelloni" turned out to actually be ravioli. Also, I was surprised by the intense flavor of bacon on my dish, which don't get me wrong was ok since I eat meat. For someone who is vegetarian on the other hand, this really should have been mentioned on the menu. The flavor was ok, but really nothing impressive. The husband easily allowed me to try his chicken, which I knew was not a good sign. Usually when something is really good, he will be a pain in the ass about letting me try it and usually will tell me order my own. The chicken itself was cooked ok, but the batter had no flavor to it and the honey drizzle was only in certain places. The hubby was disappointed in the entire entrée stating that the biscuit didn't have enough honey and no butter provided, the mashed potato portion was puny and they were nothing impressive, and the 2 bites of coleslaw were bland.  Because we had a 50.00 gift card, we needed to order something else so we decided on the apple money bread dessert. We were told that it would take an extra 12 minutes, which we were fine with because we thought it would be something amazing. Not even close. What came out was a small dish of "monkey bread" (which resembled bread pudding) and a small bowl of vanilla ice cream atop cut out pieces of menu which we presumed to be pre-used due to the large grease stain on the one underneath the bowl of ice cream. The monkey bread was very disappointing as it was mostly apples, and the cinnamon/ sugar mixture appeared to be sprinkled atop after the dish was done baking. Additionally, there was a spice used in it (I think it was ginger) that was wayyyyy too prominent. It left a disgusting aftertaste in my mouth. The ice cream was fine but we were pretty sure it was Dreyers.  After finishing dessert, we waited and waited... and waited... only to wait some more. We had already let it slide that our waters were empty while eating dessert to which the waitress said she had several other tables seated so she was scrambling back and forth between them all. I found it interesting that she said this because the restaurant was practically empty. Anyways, as we sat waiting for the check, the hubby informed me that the delay was because she was sitting at a table with some obvious friends who had come in and basically just shooting the sh**. This really annoyed me. Normally, I am a patient person, but after having a crappy meal, I really just wanted to get home. I believe we waited for about 20 minutes just to get the check without her attempting to check on us during that time.  So to conclude, Culinary dropout was highly disappointing. Food was not great, service was crappy... This is one of the few instances where nothing impressed me and I see absolutely no reason to return to Culinary Dropout. I gave it 1 extra star because the food was not horrible, portion sizes were decent, and the décor was aesthetically pleasing. One last thought though: Maybe the chef should go back to culinary school to learn how to season chicken properly and perhaps learn the difference in pasta's?

I love balls!!! Meat that is!!! So I was excited to try Meatballz. My husband and I went on a Friday night around 7:30 and the place was empty. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs so I would have the opportunity to try their namesake item and what they are supposed to be so famous for. The husband got an Italian sammich of some sort.  When I got my pasta, I was surprised. The menu said "spaghetti and meatballs (plural) and in the middle of my pasta sat one little lonely old meatball. There was a lot of pasta, but there was one puny little meatball! WTF? To top it off, the meatball wasn't even very good. Nothing impressive in my book, no flavor, and to be honest, I have had frozen meatballs that were better. The husband was not a fan of his sammich either. The bread was way too crusty and hard and it was pretty small for the price. This place is a total loser and I am almost positive they will go under. They are not welcome in our community!

FIRST! K so sometimes, you just gotta have something familiar, simple, cheap! This is that place for the hubby and I. When we don't know what else to eat, we automatically drive to Taco Bell. If we had a programmable location on our car, this would be at the top of the list. Yes, I know TB is not exactly healthy, gourmet, or even real meat, but you know its delicious! Everyone deep down loves some TB but doesn't wanna admit it. This particular location is our favorite mainly because we have watched them go from struggling and retarded to getting our order nailed down to a fine art. Everyone here is always friendly especially the night manager who has been there since the memorable day 3 years ago that we moved to this wonderful town I call The Copa. I am assuming she is a manager because this girl does whatever it takes to make the customers happy and really seems to love her job. I can't see your average TB clerk being that way and sticking around for 3 years! Anyways, when you are sitting around trying to decide what to eat, I recommend going here and getting a few tacos, chalupas, and cheesy bean and rice burritos. Trust me, you wont be sorry... while eating them that is, might be sorry later though!  PS: Try their new verde salsa and the fire roasted salsa (on cheesy items). They are terrific!

I havn't been able to find a place with tastier wings than this! The mango habenero wings are the best. Its really the sauce that makes them so if you order anything else from the menu that gives you a choice of wing sauce, get the mango habenero if you love spicy. Its sweet but very spicy (2nd to last in line for spiciness of the sauces) but the flavor is beyond amazing! Another flavor that is good is the asian zing if you are not that into spice. The hub loves the garlic parmesan wings. Kind of a different flavor and might not be for some people.  If you are not a wing lover, there are other items on their menu that are good choices. I love their buffalo chicken flatbread pizza as well as their buffalitos. For sides and appetizers, their buffalo chips, crispy southwest dippers, roasted garlic mushrooms with southwest ranch, and slammers with hamburger and pepperjack cheese and pretty legit. For wing lovers, remember that Tuesday is their cheap wing night and Thursday is cheap boneless wings. Also, while you are waiting on your food, make sure to request a trivia/ poker device so you can play games as you wait.  Lastly, if you are on a strict diet, do not go here. I don't think there is one healthy thing on their menu. Even their salad is loaded with cheese.

My new favorite sammich spot!!! The bread is fresh and great!!! I always get the turkey tom with extra mayo (make sure you get extra mayo or you will have a dry sub on your hands). The hub loves the gargantuan. The only other advise I would give is to not get the chocolate chip cookies (they are pretty dense and not very good) and read the signs while you sit and eat. They are pretty funny. The service really is fast and I have freaked a few times. Be sure to take advantage of the free smell as well

By far one of my favorite Italian restaurants! The best thing to get here: Good old Spaghetti and meatballs! The sauce is sweet but robust, chunky, and just plain good! But the star of the show is the meatballs. They are soft, have great flavor but are somehow very light. Best meatballs I have ever had! Some other great entrees are the lasagna which is meaty and rich and the rigatoni with what else, the meatballs! Baked rigatoni with marinara and Alfredo and lots of meat of your choice. The best comfort food out there! Their Alfredo is pretty good as well. Years ago when I was in high school, I was obsessed with their lobster fusilli but they took it off the menu  :(  Why does that always happen to me? So anyways, I guess I am just hoping that someone from Rigatonys will see this review and decide to bring this dish back. Although... at this point, I love their spaghetti and meatballs so much that I don't know if I would order it. Haha. And of course, I cannot complete my review without mentioning their salad and bread. The salad is so above average. Mixed greens, cheese, olives, tomato, onion, and salami make for an amazing salad already but when the house Italian dressing is added, oh my god, out of this world. The bread is warm and I love dipping it in the olive oil with oregano and basil and maybe even a little balsamic. Lastly, their they have a very good tiramisu but I don't think I can ever order it knowing what their bread pudding is like. The bread pudding is one of the better ones I have had, and with bread pudding being my favorite dessert, I have to get it if I am going to have dessert. Rigatonys has a great flavor and the right amount of spice and the apples add a different texture to it. Its very good!  A few tips: You can actually buy their salad dressing and tiramisu just by going to the hostess stand. Also, Rigatonys used to be located at Knox and AZ Ave but the new location is much nicer and bigger.

Tried Smashburger for the first time a few weeks ago. I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I ordered the Arizona burger (chipotle mayo, habenero cheese, jalapenos, guac, lettuce, tomato) and sweet potato fries. The burger was spicy which i loved. The burger patty had alot of flavor which was surprising because I always thought that smashing a burger makes the juices and flavor run out. This was not the case. The sweet potato fries were really good and I liked that they put rosemary and oil on those. The sweet potato fries were a great compliment to the spicy burger. The hubby had the mushroom swiss burger with smash fries. He enjoyed both as well. Decor was cool and the service was fine. The only complaint I have is the price. It was 21.00 for my husbands 1/2 pound burger, my 1/3 pound burger, and the two orders of fries. Its actually cheaper to go to Fuddruckers and we get more food from Fuddys as well. I will say though that Smash burger was mighty tasty so I would still go back.

Came here for brunch while visiting Vegas. The atmosphere was simple yet, modern and sophisticated and the service was spot on.  Being that I had heard so much about Max Brenner, I felt it was my duty to try some of his famous hot chocolate. So I decided on the Mexican hot chocolate having never had Mexican HC before. I loved it! It had a unique but delicious flavor with a slight kick at the end from the cayenne pepper. For my meal, I decided on something less sweet: The Rosen Deli smoked turkey crepe. It was an egg crepe with swiss cheese, turkey and mushroom inside with a salad on top that consisted of greens, bell peppers and mandarin oranges. The crepe would have been salty if it were not for that salad on top. It was also accompanied by some potato wedges that were seasoned with of all things, cocoa powder and other spices. They were very good. It was a tasty meal but after trying the Cinnamon apple pecan and white chocolate truffle french toast my friend had ordered, I was wishing I had ordered something sweet for my brunch. The french toast was amazing, by far one of the best french toasts I have ever eaten. Lucky for me that my friend only ate half and left me with the remainder. After brunch, we decided to look around at all the chocolates. We were given samples of the chocolate covered pecans which were delicious and I purchased a couple of chocolates to eat while wandering around Ceasars: The toasted coconut and a chocolate with whiskey in it. Both were very good although pricey. I did manage to find a good buy though. It came with two hug mugs (mugs specially designed to hug with your hands when drinking hot chocolate so your hands get warm, two saucers and a tin of hot chocolate all for 25.00. I thought it was not a bad price so I purchased it and plan on making that hot chocolate soon once I am done with the first few phases of my diet. So if you are in Vegas and looking for a decent Brunch, Max Brenner is a great place! Just make sure you order all sweets when you go. You will not regret it and will be in heaven!

I was elated to see this new cupcake store in Gilbert right down the street from my work. My husband's birthday was on February 25th so I decided to get him 4 cupcakes from this place. The shop was a bit empty and cold feeling but I didn't let that stop me from buying some cupcakes. I purchased 4 cupcakes, the cotton candy flavored, the pancake and bacon cupcake, the red velvet, and the malt ball. In addition, I purchased another 3 cupcakes for me and my two co workers to try. In total, it cost 22.00 for 7 cupcakes. Expensive yes, but I figured that 4 were for my husbands birthday so it was ok to spend that once in a while. In any event, my co workers and I tried the cupcakes we had ordered (one pancake and bacon for me, one vanilla with milk chocolate frosting, and one vanilla, with vanilla frosting) the cakes themselves didn't have any flavor really especially the pancake one, and the milk chocolate frosting and vanilla frosting were overly sweet. So sweet that I cringed. The frosting on the pancake and bacon cupcake was good though and the bacon really made the cupcake. So all in all, I wasn't very excited with the cupcakes my and my co workers had tried but I saw some potential and even was considering going back and trying some of their other special cupcakes such as their PB and J. Then I took the 4 I ordered home to my husband hoping maybe he would enjoy them somewhat. When he removed the paper from the red velvet cupcake, there was a long hair sticking out the bottom of the cupcake. Completely unacceptable and disgusting. Needless to say, he didn't eat that cupcake and said he didn't want to eat any of the others which I can't blame him for. It was completely embarrassing. Not only that, I feel like it was a complete waste of money. I am not usually one to write a negative review but this place was very disappointing. I thought about calling to see if they would be willing to do anything but I keep thinking they probably wouldn't refund me and I sure as heck don't want coupons or something to go here again as I definitely wouldn't. Sorry Top it Cupcakes,  I gave you multiple chances, but you just didn't make the grade with me.

Been here twice now and really have wanted this place to succeed since I work super close, like across the parking lot. However, I see lots of issues:  - Milk has been scorched twice now in my cafe mocha making the flavor horrible - Service, although friendly, is very slow as there seems to be only one machine to make the coffee - Prices are too high. Their regular size is not very big, yet costs more than Starbucks, 3.95 if I remember right. Not even the large size! - The atmosphere is very cold feeling with concrete floors, no warm colors on the walls, etc. If the four things listed before this were not an issue, then this wouldn't be a big deal. - Advertising is not looking to good. There is a sign out by the street but its tiny and unreadable for people approaching it.  - Their location is not a good one considering there is a Starbucks right up the road in both directions. Great location for me though if it didn't have all these other issues against it - No free wifi. This is a problem when every other coffee shop in the area offers it. You need to be able to compete. - Cash only - This is also a problem when it comes to competing with Starbucks and every other coffee shop in the area  Here is what I praise this place on:  - They really seem to be trying with their service as they are very friendly.  - They have tried to advertise more by providing coupons to the office suites in back and around which is where I along with many people work - They bake all their pastries and desserts (not including bagels) from scratch every day. This includes their croissants, muffins, along with their cookies which actually are very good - They ask if you would like whole, 2%, or skim milk in your coffee. Coffee enthusiast like to have these kinds of options.   I really do hope they can turn things around. If not, I don't see them going very far and being open very long. Morning Glory, I am pulling for you and will give you my business if you can correct some issues.

I am sooo happy we finally got one of these awesome yogurt places in the Copa!!! Went a couple weeks ago for the first time and loved it! Had cake batter yogurt with...get ready for it.... fruity pebbles, brownies, strawberries, coconut, hot fudge, and chocolate chips. What can I say, I am a kid at heart. My concoction rocked and I have decided I am going to call it "Lil Devils delight." Owners of Yogurt Jungle, I would appreciate if you would put this on your menu... your welcome. Anyhoo, I love that they have punch cards and the service was very friendly. Also cool is that they will make you a smoothie or a milkshake. You just put everything in a cup and they will mix it. I have not seen that done at other yogurt places. A tip for anyone that has not been to a yogurt place like this: they charge you by the weight so don't get more than what you can eat. Will I be back? You bet you fruity pebbles I will!

I am proud to say that the hubby and I have reached a consensus on who has the best Italian Beef sammich in the Phoenix region. Its by far and away Taylor Street!!! Forget all the rambling I did about Lobbys (that was hours before I went to Taylor Street) and Lukes it forgetful when comparing it to this gem. I will most likely downgrade the star ratings on both   :O  Taylor Street has it all: great prices (5.00 for a sammich and 1.00 for ALL of the add ons ie. onion, peppers, cheese), great tasting Italian beef, the sammiches are larger, fries rock, service was extremely friendly and fast, and establishment was clean and nice looking. I got my Italian Beef with grilled onions and sweet peppers, added ketchup (yes yes, that is my thing) and it was soooooo good. I let the low carb diet go out the window for this one and ate the whole damn sammich along with some of their crispy perfectly cooked crinkle cut fries! Hubby had the Italian Beef with hot peppers, fries, and then because we had driven so far and he wanted to try it, he ordered a Philly cheese-steak for dessert. He said that the Italian Beef is definitely the way to go at Taylor's although the cheese-steak was not bad. After trying his Italian beef, I deemed the hot peppers the way to order it rather than with sweet peppers.  So to sum it up, go to Taylor Street, get the Italian beef sammich "dipped" with hot peppers and grilled onions. Add ketchup if you need that extra oomph. If you are from Chicago, you must try this place. Heck, if you like tons of meat, delicious bread, and perfectly cooked fries at low low prices, you must try this place!

I've had a pimple on my chin that is extremely red for a few months now and doesn't seem to be fading. I decided to go to a dermatologist for the first time to make sure it wasn't something more serious. This place came recommended by a few people I work with so I made an appointment with Kristen Peterson. I arrived on time and was taken to a room relatively quick, however, once in the room, I waited for what felt like forever. It had to be at least 20 to 25 minutes. When Kristen finally arrived, she apologized for the delay and stated that "this other girl took way longer than expected." I am pretty understanding so I let it go that I was waiting that long even though it was my lunch break and I needed to get back to the office. I explained what I was there for and all Kristen told me was I needed to use sunblock and proceeded to order the assistant to get me some topical ointment samples, cleanser samples, moisturizer samples, and sunblock samples. I explained that my makeup has sunblock in it and asked if that was acceptable. She never did really answer me. She sat there reading or writing in my file most of the time but did not really speak to me and barely looked at me. She didn't really direct me on how to use the samples or ask me any questions. In the end, I was told that it was just a pimple and to use the samples. I've never encountered a so called "medical professional" like this. She kind of acted like I was wasting her time and like she really didn't care. Just throw some samples at me and hope I go away. She did end up injecting some steroids into the area to ease the inflammation but didn't really tell me when I should see improvement. It has now been over 2 weeks and the redness has not faded and my skin around the area is extremely dry I think due to the topical cream. I was supposed to go back in June for a "skin exam" but just cancelled it because I think I will be going elsewhere for my dermatology needs.

Well this is a problem! JG's got a new addiction! I am not even a coffee addict but happened to need a pick me up yesterday afternoon. Had been wanting to try Dutch Brothers should the need arise for a nice iced coffee on a hot summers day. So I went and to my delight, had the most delicious cup of iced coffee one could ever possibly dream of. I ordered the double chocolate mocha "skinny" and it was undoubtedly the best cup of coffee I have ever had. Starbucks can suck it! I ordered an iced cocomo "skinny" for my boss and she seemed to really enjoy it and a caramelo (whatever the f it is called) for my co worker and she said it was ridiculously good. That's huge coming from her because she is really picky when it comes to coffee. Anyways, the staff was super friendly, fun, and helpful. The price was great (4.00 for a medium coffee tax included and the cup was pretty large), and I love that they offer punch cards and give you a punch for every cup of coffee you order. After about 6, you get a free cup and keep in mind that Tuesdays are double punch! I foresee this location (literally 2 miles away from where I work) being a potential problem, yet a blessing for me. Caffeine does bad things to me... I get the shakes, get jittery and my legs start moving uncontrollably and violently like I am having a bad episode of restless leg syndrome. However, I do get my work done super quick and do stupid things with more energy and a smile on my face!!! Yes, when I am coming down from my "high," I feel kinda crappy but heck, this coffee is so amazing that I am willing to deal with the after affects. You must try Dutch Brothers!  Other tips: I wasn't sure if they took credit cards but confirmed on my visit yesterday that they do in fact take them. Also, this place is a walk up or drive thru, there is no indoor seating. They actually are really quick too for a place that you can see grinds each cup of coffee fresh.   Keep the locations coming Dutch Bros, I want you to put that godforsaken Starbucks out of bidness and I believe it is highly possible!

I feel bad for this place in a way because I have a feeling that they are not going to be around for very long. While the service was fast and friendly, the atmosphere was cold and the food was subpar. I ordered what I thought was going to be a Chicago dog as that is what it was called but it didn't come with any of the Chicago dog toppings (mustard, celery salt, peppers, pickles, tomatoes, hello?!?). It was a simple small hot dog with ketchup, mustard, relish, and onion. This was the kind of hot dog I would make at home. The waffle fries were decent but the sauce they gave me with them was not appealing at all. It had a funky color to it with a funky taste to match. My co worker ordered a gyro and was disappointed. She said that the meat tasted like it was frozen and then warmed on the grill. We were thinking it would be freshly sliced gyro meat. I don't remember the prices being overly high but they were not good either for the amount and quality of food you got. In any event, this place is kinda depressing and I would not return.

By far, one of the best bakeries in AZ. We used to order these cakes for B Day celebrations at the last place I worked. My fav was the lemon poppyseed with buttercream frosting. I am not even much of a fan of lemon cake but this one is delicious. Also great are the carrot cake and the chocolate chocolate chip. Not only are the cakes delicious, they are visually beautiful as well. The cakes cost a bit more than if you went to a grocery store bakery, but its worth it!
