Cryogenics & ice-cream? YES, this place is a definite MUST!    5% Tropical Turbine is by far my fave (light, refreshing & satisfying).  My husband's  fave is the 14% Peanut Butter Bonds which is out of this world rich & creamy!   P.S.  Someone tell the staff to get off auto-pilot and get excited about this awesome product!

Another amazing meal at Beckett's Table!  The new crab cake appetizer is simply the BEST crab cake in the valley!

I stopped in yesterday and the owner said this location had only been open for 2 days. So, I'm not sure how they have reviews from 9 and 12 months ago. I got the chicken wrap lunch combo and it was very good!  Unfortunately, the next day I brought my whole family there at 11:30 for lunch.  The OPEN sign was lit and the door unlocked but we were turned away and told the restaurant was actually closed until 1.  WTF?? We drove away and passed it again  a few minutes later and the OPEN sign was still on. Not cool Sheba's, not cool!!
