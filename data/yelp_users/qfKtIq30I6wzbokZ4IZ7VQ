I can't say enough great things about Welcome Diner.  It has my type of feel. I've been a few times and I love bringing guests from out of town here. The counter service outside is outstanding. The guy, I forgot his name, generally works the window and is patient and helpful. He's cool. Like the hip friend that knows about good and drink and can guide you around a really fun menu to get you what you want.  Went with the peanut butter burger, one of the fried chicken biscuit plates and a jackfruit French fry dish that just murdered my expectations.  There's a cool inside spot but it's always full when I get there. I have sitting inside at welcome on my bucket list. The bartender is always entertaining a fun crowd.  Keep opening up fun places and turning around Phoenixs food culture!

Awkward and slow.  Multiple people I front of me and everything seemed painstakingly slow. I wasn't in a rush and have no issues waiting, but everything was con-fuddled with mistakes and then awkward questions asking the customers how they would prefer there problems to be solved.  Huge pet peeve is when an employee says, "well worst case scenario....yada yada yada" because it's not the worst case scenario. The worst case scenario is you over charge my card and put the wrong address in your mailing system. You then never refund my money and I never get my package delivered. That's worst case but even then it could get worse!

Id definitely recommend this texas style hole in the wall joint.  It reminds me of my days I texas.  Funny bumper stickers and hats as decor. Expire fed friendly waitstaff that know how to get you feeling comfortable or put you I your place.   I went with a cold bud light as the domestic choices just spoke to me! The chopped brisket sandwich was really quiet good despite being served upside down.  Maybe that's the thing.  I ordered a frito pie and and it came on bag ready to go.  What a good ole Sunday place. They brought be a fun little fried rice cake beignet thing with a good amount of powdered sugar and life was good.  If this place wasn't in a strip center I think you'd believe you were in a shack on a ranch grubbing down. Enjoy!

Always a great place to catch up and chill. It's loud and small and dirty and fun! The 2 bartenders work hard for that paper and do a great job making their heads move and catch the eye of the next patron!  Always recommended for dive bar feels.

I had no idea what I was walking into here. Honestly the place wasn't that bad for what it is. It's like walking into your degenerate uncles apartment to watch sports and horses and listen to gold laden dudes complain about who is better, The Great Brett Favre or That Punk Aaron Rodgers. The food was decent for bar food and the beers were really cheap. That's a huge plus but if you're looking for a good place to watch sports with like minded individuals you might as well keep going. Although I do think you should give it a shot because this might be a good place to make some wagers and walk with some side cash.

I'm never ashamed of the half chicken deal here! It's fall apart delicious and with two mediocre sides and a slice of cornbread I'm good. I think my total was like 9$. I feel good about the convenience, quickness, and friendly service.

Quick and efficient day cleaning. I come here regularly because the staff are fast, they always have a good smile and get me in and out.  The pricing is appropriate and everything I have done is quality. I definitely recommend to anyone in the north central area.

Texas native living in AZ.  Arizona has not much love for this gem of a 24hr fast food jaunt. My gal hates this place but I was able to convince her of breakfast at 10am and wahlah! A believer is born. She had a morning taquito and to her annoyance they aren't taquito sin the general sense. They are more like flour rolled burritos lol.  But if you are looking for the fat kids shangri-la look no further than the honey butter chicken biscuit. Heck, get 2!!!!! And their oh jay is the real deal! OJ!!!!

"pb and j in a cup. 60g of protein and load up on your bars and supps." Haha I sound like a meat head. Actually really good stuff for guys trying to add some weight. Haven't found a good one for the lady yet.  Maybe we will go with strawberry-banana yogurt style. That's a sure fire right? Really clean and has a cool bar top too.

Perfect staycation location. Easy to get to with enough to do and relaxing areas around that you'll be happy for the price.  The staff were all engaging and perceptive to what two young adults and a two year old needed arriving late at night.  Greeted with cocktails, baggage help, and some laughs and playful spirits for the kiddo.  Our room was conveniently accessible,clean and well taken care of.  We found that we didn't mark what bed we wanted and ended up with two full sizers which ended up being perfect because one of us is a light sleeper when the kiddo sleeps with.    The food we ordered for room service was flavorful besides the gin lemonade concoction, seemingly good idea just poorly executed.  All in all dinner was hot and breakfast was fresh.  Had we not had the baby with us we would've loved to get dinner at one of their restaurants but we will save that for next time.  The only gripe was the tv.  Lol late night we wanted to watch a movie/movies because it's fun for the kiddo and he loves em. The issue is the style of tv and remote situation.  I love new tech and incorporating it into the experience but the roller bar and keyboard setup was awful. The mouse hardly moves where you want and the movie set up lame. You can do a bulk movie buy but it's in a view that's pre hd and honestly blurry quality.  Hyatt, fix that. All details other than that were perfect! Good news is they'll be updating this format in June.  Keep up the great work and amazing guest services.

A real chi-town sports spot.  A good amount of friends are fans of bean town and regularly come here. I like anywhere that em brasses its people and becomes a Mecca for sporting events.  I've been here a few times and it's always a good time. The food is great for bar food because it's def better than most. The beers are awesome, I think I took down a few lagunitas while throwing darts for a while and watching some futbol. Come here for a good time on the west side of phoenix.

Decided to check this place out. Lots of buddies tell me stories of childhood burgers so I wanted to experience their nostalgia. Burgers are cooked with a bit of red wine, fries were delicious, could've passed on the chili. Any where that serves rc cola gets high praise in my book. Could've used some sports on the tv while I sat at the bar but whatever soap opera or movie that was wasn't terrible. Not my fav burger of all time but it was dang good.

Huge fan of this collection of sellers.  My lady sent us this way in hopes of finding a center table for the living room and we were able to find multiple options.  The vast array of cubbies with collectible, refer bushes items, decorative pieces or just interesting knickknacks is bountiful. You'll have more trouble not just spending the whole day here and grabbing a bite to eat from their cafe. If you find something you like you can either pull the tag and take it up front or have an employee follow you to your treasure.  They bring it out front for you and are very helpful. Happy hunting.

Out of all the bars and clubs in Scottsdale this was one of the ones I felt most comfortable in.  While many of my friends toted it as the midget bar, I came to realize that is a small portion but unique portion of the bar. There are people playing beer pong, spinning a shot wheel and over all just having a good time. There was a lot less pretentiousness here and beers and the reasonable rates. I'd come back here, especially after dealing with the sausage fest that is Scottsdale.

A recommendation from a friend when asked about hot spots for breakfast and this place didn't disappoint. It's very old school and hasn't lost a beat. They have quick, smart, friendly wait staff that are very accommodating and detail oriented. Came on a Tuesday and they were will busy. Their parking lot is all sorts of weird as parking spaces go in every direction but you'll figure it out.  Sat at the counter top as always. Bar and countertop service is always the best.  The menu is seemingly gigantic but is really manageable.   It seems they are known for their salsa and hangover cures so I asked what to go with and was recommended anything with house made chorizo. Went with the Eggs Maximilian and it was legit! Def try! Two people drink and breakfasts. 25$. Solid value and great deal! Will def be back to explore more options.

Man! Good times, good times.  I don't remember the pizza but I figure it was good. Expected to wait several hours and wasn't wrong, so we went next door a enjoyed beverages.  I'm a skinny fellow and 4 bottles of wine later I had PIZZA. Usually don't eat before 8 so the wait didn't matter for hunger's sake, it was the wine that took the toll.  Either way I remember a quite fellow tossing pizzas and thanking everyone that entered his store.  I appreciated it and will go back again.

This coffee bar has a lot to offer the young professionals and hip kiddos.  It's a little awkward for older generationials. The bar top is low and there are multiple places to order at which causes them confusion. The drinks and snacks are amazing. You can easily flutter around 30people on macs doing schoolwork, lifework, or artwork.  Get comfortable and hang out. Doesnt matter if you're loud either because everyone's listening to their headphones. I also love the staff here. They're helpful, friendly and clever.

Wasn't sure what to expect when we stopped in while waiting for Butterfields.  It's a counter service semi kitchen production line. Very mom and pop feel, which can be good or bad.  It was fairly empty inside while was fine because we wanted to get in and it. The coffee and muffin we got were decent enough.  I don't know if I'll be back just because here wasn't a true wow factor in anyway. If you're going to be competing in the coffee Biz you might want to amp up some part of the operation and clean your grill ever now and then.  Also aren't plantations notoriously known for underpaying the workers in an effort to grow rich at the top. Not a very large history of positivity in the world of plantations.

Best prices hotel and youngest vibe in central Phoenix. In an area loaded with resorts and overpriced hotels this one always hits the spot. Their pool usually has a young hipster vibe with beautiful people relaxing and getting some sun and drinks in them.   The rooms are clean and large and have every accommodation you could want. There's plenty to do in the area in terms of food and drink and it's minutes away from museums and downtown attractions.   Book direct as they usually have better deals then websites and a great morning breakfast.

What a beautiful drive.  Bring swimsuits and snacks! Stop along the way and soak it all up. Finish your ride before 4pm at the cave dwellings.  If you're looking for food skip Globe. Unless you're on a bike and hit up the saloon. Happy travels!

The only place for an adult to enjoy a movie.  We regularly drive out of our way for super comfy seats, beer while we watch and friendly service.   We generally don't get food anymore as it is all very old ballpark like.  Lacking flavor etc.  I think I've tried 5 items and all are very out of a package foods.

A true five star review. Showed up midweek around 1 and they had a wait. Odd for us being frequent diners but speaks loads to them doing things right. Waited about ten minutes outside on the bench before we were notified and walked to the table by the hostess. They were on point, it didn't take long for the busters to turn tables and get another set of diners in. Our server was spend is. She recommended items that were popular and explained to us the baked pancakes.  We love new creative things so we both ordered entrees. The Irish Benny was delicious. The hollandaise was creamy and buttery and the egg poached perfectly. My girlfriend ordered the eggs verde and raved about them the whole time. She saved me a tiny bite and I'd agree.  The baked apple pancake was different and delicious. The server brought us honey and lemon and taught us her strategy and we were very excited about it. There are a ton of different options to try and we can't wait to come back.  It's hard to find a breakfast joint with food let alone a menu that drives you to come back.

Had an amazing massage. From a dude!!!! I usually prefer a lady to work on my shoulders but my masseuse this last time was amazing. He was a tall man with a surferesque name. I'm still horrible with names but whatever. I'll look it up and modify this. He was comfortable and easy to talk to. For whatever reason I don't get massages to relax, I'm getting them to work out different pains or discomforts. He took that to heart when I told him and explained different causes and solutions. He worked areas that triggered the discomfort instead of just the uncomfortable areas. I signed up for a membership because of him but have no idea what I get for signing up. I'll figure that out throw week.

It is so easy to show up here and eat 50cupcakes. The kiddo loves them, the lady loves them, my dead puppy loved them.  That got morbid.  It's amazing. I'll Pay 25$ for cupcakes all day when they have delicious combos of pb and banana, strawberry and smores! Fun, creative, efficient environment.

My favorite pizza in the Valley. Ya ya ya.....so what it's a chain. The proof and bake their doughs perfectly. The deep dish pizza is sweet and hot and is perfect for my pepperoni, jalapeño and pineapple tastes.  Their brewed beers are fun and they recently started bringing in more unique styles.  No pizzookie this time but once I had the smores flavor I'll never go back. Until the promotion is over lol.   Where else can you find a fun little restaurant style sports bar open till midnight. It's great for industry peeps.  Last but not least, Stewart is the best. He's the strong accented bartender that is pretty much a dream. He's been here for years which is amazing. He's polite, quick, witty and has a great memory. I will continue to try to steal him for my business!

Perfect late night eatery.  Definitely feeling the vibe of a midnight run for a double double with crispy fried and a milkshake. Love that there are always around 15 other like minded individuals waiting when I get here and the staff is always able to bang it out with smiles and ease! Keep it up. A must go for any east coaster.

Stopped in for a quick bite with the little guy. Sat immediately by a young host. Server came by quickly and we skipped the intro as we have been here multiple times. Order the chargrilled halibut, crawfish étouffée and a Lafayette topping. Our server Ben brought us a cold glass a milk and a tall Kilt Lifter. Life is good. Infant loves fish and crab. Was out in a flash and had a few good laughs.

So far, so good.  Dry cleaners are like girlfriends you frequent them if they do a good job, they're convenient and they don't cost you too much money. Everyone here has been friendly and speedy. I brought in a stain and they got it done no problem. I'll def keep coming here while I live in the area.

I come here monthly to get a quick trim.  I usually skip the massage at the end because it's just not worth the extra time. The girls here are super friendly and do a consistent job. They kinda remember me each time but not really. At some point they will go digital with their customer retention program but oh well. Good cut at a good price.

20$ for a haircut seems a bit much for a cheap trim up but its worth it with friendly service and cool atmosphere. Never rushed and a quick machine massage at the end. Don't go there every time I need a buzz but I do on occasion when I don't want to be rushed.   Area of Improvement: The art and TVs should not stop at waist level since you are facing down most of the time.

A perfect Starbucks outting is quick and efficient. Some Starbucks brew a slightly burnt coffee. This one consistency has delicious brew and can get me in and out in minutes. Thanks again team! Could probably change the trash out more often, people go for the recycle bin but it's usually full so they default to the trash side. No biggie.

I go all the time. Sit at the oversized bar top because you get personalized service from the bartenders and you have plenty of room to setup and do work or read or just enjoy the food and lunches. Everything is catered to a meal style that is anti inflammatory. You'd think that means you would lose on flavor but it's not true. I haven't had a dish that I dislike. I went with the seasonal salad and a bison burger cooked to order.  They have a vast array of drinks and wines that are healthy and flavorful. Erich the manager always stops by and says hi and makes me feel at home. Good place, tell your friends.  Also park In the lot out front, they validate.

Pretty disappointed with this place. Lights out all over. Purses and personal belongings all over the bar. Dirty menus. Bar supplies not put up. The food was substandard. We ordered hummus and it was watery and bland. I know it's a chain but a little more management presence would go along way with details. It was busy and the food came out quick but it was flat, bland and boring. I think people come here for cuisine that's different and it's in a good location. I want this place to do better because I have been to some that were good.

I've stopped in twice to this location. First time was slightly lack luster. It was a Monday and they had a wait for what we found out was a poppin special. 20$ for bruschetta and a bottle.  The choices that we were guided to were good but the wine was ho-hum.  Either way it was a good date night not great.  Fast forward a month to the most recent time. We had a blast, we found seats at the bar top and the bartender was engaging and fun and made great suggestions. The food and wine were on point and the vibe was completely different.  If definitely recommend this location for dates and finishing up the night.

As an apple believer I was a bit disappointed this round.  It's usually hard to be disappointed in retail but I made my appointment for a screen repair. Was told a price but was made to believe it would be cheaper. Went for the screen replacement and was told I needed to buy a whole new phone. I've broken many a screen but this transaction felt awful. I was told the phone was too bent after it was looked it for 1min. Honestly lame. I don't wear skinny jeans and I'm not sure how it was too bent for repair after 3months of ownership. Whatever it is it just felt bad. Needless to say I still rock apple products without disdain.

It's our favorite go to spot for a great and quick breakfast. My girlfriend's been coming here weekly for over a year. We really feel like VIPs when we bring the little one. The food is great, everyone loves the protein pancakes. Quick and friendly service and our orders are ways hot, fresh and out quick.   We keep coming back each week and will continue to do so! Thanks again y'all.

Had a few people suggest I check it out since it's right down the street. Pretty standard. I was really hoping for food that popped. We had a spicy penne which wasn't anything to write about so I won't. We ordered spaghetti and meatballs for the little one and he was fine with it. Also had a pesto pasta with chicken. Once again it was kinda flat. We didn't finish because it was kinda boring. The garlic bread was alright but yada yada yada I want food with flavor. Maybe I'll ask for that the next time we stop in if we do.

A little far for a normal jaunt but there is a variety here that surpasses most other plant shops. I was left alone for the most part and was checked up on appropriately. I know nothing about plants but needed something that would help make my home feel More relaxed. The newest girl sent me in the right direction with the elephant food plant. I didn't know the prices of the pits which was annoying but the omens picked was perfect and a steal. There was some clearance deal on it and it was like 7$! Love that. Love the farmers market, love the honey and the older lady that was helping out.

So lame. Do not stop here. The ruins are legit Ruined. It sounds so cool! Then you walk up the small like trek and realize you're standing where a ruin once was. A few stones in a circle.  It would behoove the preservationist to build the ruins back up and be happy that people will come visit. No one comes here anymore because there isn't anything to see. Def don't keep driving to the seven springs. It's worn out and not taken care of either. Good drive with good music but that's on me. Plus baby slept.

Love the Vig. As an industry guy it's a great place away from where I work to play cornhole, get some grub and a few beverages late at night. It's funny I've never been here during the day.  We had a few apps this most recent time in. The dates were spot on, the hummus creamy and had a great flavor. The server recommended the prime dip. It was good but then again I'm a snob with this item. I'd give it a hard sx soft seven. All in all the drinks were cold and quick, the service fun and friendly.  The bags are made of what feels like basketball shorts and have lost a lot of stuffing. Could probably use a new set but a good bags player can adapt. Come here for a fun night.

Always a fan of this joint.  Call me lazy but grabbing a split hot dog with cheese in a couple minutes makes my life better. I guess things could be worse but I don't care! I love a single patty burger with fresh jalapeños and mushrooms and whatever else I add on from there. It's a chain but I'm cool with it. Another hot dog pleas!

I'm a fox lover and it's no different with true food. I could eat here everyday and feel good doing it. Bought the kids almond butter and banana and strawberry sandwich and he loved it.  Friend had the kale-aid which is his go to and would recommend to every mountain hiker in the valley.  Next up was the kale and avocado dip which has yet to disappoint. Can't find it anywhere else. Not too filling and a perfect start to lunch. I had the turkey rice bowl which is a clean combo to give you energy throughout the day.   I had the Spontaneous Happiness drink and sipped it in on the patio as we finished our meal when the rhubarb crisp that the server suggested. Our server was attentive but let us do our thing and the place was visibly clean in all aspects.

They opened Monday morning early for brunch on Labor Day and I see why. They were packed and the bartenders were working it hard! I sat in the corner near the Bloody Mary bar and everything looked clean and stocked.  The bartender, a tall lad just busting out service well drinks took care of me intermittently.  He was great.   I went with the green Bloody Mary. It was a great concept but it needed something. I added salt and a little extra from the free service bar and it made it perfect. They had a breakfast sandwich on a large English muffin type bread and I seriously think it's my favorite restaurant breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  I wanted more!!! Even though it was plenty food I finished my cheesy potatoes with the biggest grin. Keep up the good work.

I just like this place. Originally sat on the front patio which is funny because in always sat there, but we moved to the back with the dog so we could watch all the sport. There was a slight rain a brewin so they brought us an umbrella. Beers are always on point! Good was hit and miss. Tacos were good but deconstructed. Works for some. The Thai hummus tastes like peanut butter hummus. Not a fan. Had a bunch of other apps that were fine. I love the beer, the service and the whole place. Just gotta find my dishes.

Great dive bar to hit up and relax. It has become a go to favorite as we have visited randomly over the years. My girlfriend used to think it was such a secret hideout and now it's pretty common place for us. Great location and fast service. The bartenders recommend specials and were quick to get us going.  Restrooms were clean and shuffleboard was well maintained. Looking for a small dive and feel without the skunky smell. This is your place.

Second time in and I'm still going back.  The atmosphere is beer centric with great food compliments to set off a solid meal. There's a back patio with cornhole and plenty of seating so you can enjoy killer Phoenician weather this time of year. The selection of beers will keep you going for quite some time, my friend had a flight and although there wasn't much guidance of the random beers we knew nothing about its will fun to try and learn and ask questions from their lively bar crew.  It's places like these that are really helping develop the Phoenix food and drink scene.

Great experience for our first time here.  Snacked on a few different apps, a fresh salad and a solid sandwich.  Service was spot on, prompt and friendly.  I like the decor and the different lighting fixtures. Will probably check out happy hour as the sever suggested it a few times maybe because we were hitting up a late lunch.

Great deals and value here. It's well organized and clean. It's easy to navigate and the shoes are still in boxes. This is by far the better Rack in the city. Stopped in next to Kierland and it was awful. Stay at the one on camelback and you will def find a good deal.

Stopped in for a late lunch on afternoon. Brought the kiddo. The place was empty save for a few bar flies. The Mac and cheese for the kiddo was amazing. He loved and and so did we. The pizza while good intentioned was below average. The quality of the toppings was low. Especially the pepperoni. It's weird to spend so much money on decor and ambiance and than try to save pennies on cheap pepperoni. No one comes back for pepperoni that curls up. Cmon. Had a couple other dishes and everything was just ho-Hum. The server/bartender was friendly and accommodating. An awkward interaction was happening right at the front door for a while between their chef and a manager. Deft a conversation to have in the back out of earshot of the guests. They have to figure some things out for sure. Make decisions that benefit and improve the guests experience. Focus on making dollars not saving pennies.

5 stars to Federal. By far my favorite pizza jaunt in Arizona.  They are legit. From recommendations about drinks to the pizzas and small bites.  Had a meaty pizza by suggestion from the bar staff and it was perfect. The crust crispy the meat was a higher quality and you could taste it.  Had a few beers and great conversation with the team that took care of us.  I've been here many times and every time it's a blast and we are able to grub happily. Keep it up.

Just a quick note. Everything's always great, usually fast. Ran out of chocolate chip muffin tips but suggested the granola bar and it was a win. Keep it up.

Hobby Lobby you ever expanding land of crafts. Not being crafty myself I usually show up with the lady to find some fun DIY items. The thing that gets me, and it's not the stores fault but an overall company directive is that everything is always discounted. So why not just make that the regular price and give me incentive based deals to promote more spending. It's just weird to hang signs everywhere discounting stuff like you're a value store. You're much better and have higher quality products than that.

As I'm starting to do more reviews, I'm realizing my little family is dominating the greater Phoenix food scene. We tried to hit this place up once before but it's a dinner only grub hub.  We brought the baby with us as we believe he is amazing and acts very well behaved. Most children prob should stay away. The food is a foodies paradise. We started with one of the better charcuterie boards that we've tried in a long time. It was loaded with some common goodies and a solid mix of items we had never heard of or even thought up. Loved it all. This place has a really cool environment with live music and fun knowledgable servers. We pigged out on a plethora of porky dishes and left stuffed. There's not much I can think of that I'd do different. I'll blame the perfectly mixed martini for that. If you're a valley native what are you waiting for?

Still love the Scottsdale location better but this one had some charm. Our server Maddy was awesome. It seemed like she was taking care of most the tables in the building.  My buddy and I were doing an online football draft and had to move tables for outlets and everyone accommodated us. Although my draft doesn't look good I don't fault Twin Peaks for he cold man beers and fried pickles.  If it's game time you should be here.

We regularly buy from this sushi place. While normally are in and out by grabbing Togo, today we decided to dine in and it was a pretty good visit.  Crab puffs are on point with the sweet chili sauce. Pretty typical. We had numerous rolls and a couple ichibans and life was good.  Service was a little ho-hum and lifeless but didn't really matter too much.

Every time I'm on the west side of Phoenix before 11am I go out of my way to grab breakfast here.  The tacos are on point: quality tortilla, fresh cooked meats, perfect potatoes and eggs. If I don't grab extra for friends I'm in trouble.

The reviews online and from people I trust have been all over the board with this place.  So here's my run at it: The ambiance is awesome. It always looks closed when I go by but it was really full when we went inside. The door was opened by a guy with huge sideburns and he was happy and helpful. We were taken to a booth really quick and it was seamless. Perfect. Our server was a nice kid. Quick and full of smiles. Brought me a Rita and beans for the kiddo on the fly.  Have I mentioned he ambience is awesome? It's a really cool churchy old town Mexico feel.  The salsa and chips were good. The kiddo loved them. The guac and queso came mixed together which was alright I guess, flavor was odd but enjoyable.  Had a pork taco on corn and a duck taco. Both were pretty good. I'd eat them again for sure.  All in all a good experience. As with most taco places it can be hit or miss with each build. The lady will want to check it out too, so I know I'll be back.

Love this place.  The food is perfect. Today I went with an open faced Cuban and it had the perfect pickles and pulled pork that you'd expect. My juice was fresh and my. Jody had a beermosa.   Plan on waiting because even at noon on a Wednesday there's a wait.  It's that good. Keep it up!

Complimentary valet makes parking easy, walk up stairs to a fun design looking towards camelback mountain. They have a good happy hour so take advantage and a large selection of great beer that I didn't expect. Ordered a meat plate and it was so-so. A little boring but a good deal for 11$. Saw a guy go after their big challenge burger, something like 7 .5pound parties and a ton of bacon and cheese and fixins. It was impressive for only 50$. Not sure he finished it.

I've stopped by two different locations now.  One off 7th st which is in an old run down house.  And his location which looks like a commercial cookie cutter version. So far I've only had the large breakfast burrito with carne Assad. Not sure why this location only has 2 stars but I've enjoyed the burrito with scratch tortillas and salsa. There has to be a reason. The burrito is pretty dang good and came out in less than 4min. I don't know about the other items yet but I'll def give them a shot soon.  Maybe it's the name? Lol

Been a fan since I went to their location off Congress in Austin.  This location seemed a bit slower but the same great flavor of burger and parm fries. Bartender was efficient but hardly made small talk. No worries since the majority of my meal was spent grubbing down hardcore. I treated myself to a specialty shake of his choice, I think it was tres leches. Took it with me as I left and I still rave about Hopdoddy. I'll bring the lady and infant next time I'm in the area.

So far so good! These guys have been killing it. A friend suggested the stack with wild berry. Basically you're drinking a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with 60g of protein. For us little guys I'll take all the calories I can get. The prices on their bars are good and they are pretty dang quick and friendly. Grab yourself a lunch card because you're going to be going through enough to get that next free shake.

Jesse too care of me. Just popped in after searching for sports clips in the area. I decided to step out of dad mode and try something new. At first it was awkward because you could tell I was he new guy. But the girls chatted me up and complemented my boots and I told Jesse to do his thing. I needed a slight hair upgrade and the compliments I got after were amazing. I waited to sign up for the monthly hair cut plan but as I'm 2weeks in I liked the way it looked before when it was fresh. So i think I just joined the club. I'll be there in a week to set it up!

I rarely head out west but when I do it's to visit family and chill.  I was bringing the din din and they had told me it's very limited out there so I stopped in to Haymaker because of the good comments on their reviews. I sat at the bar and the bartender was a pleasant young lady who clearly had a following. Plenty of what seemed to be regulars relaxing for a little happy hour and to enjoy some down home foods. I went with a Texas burger and a bowl of chili. A couple ice cold beers and life was good. They actually have a solid whiskey selection to boot. Brought the takeout food to the fam and everyone was happy with true perfectly cooked burgers and kids meals. All in all a success for a small mom and pop like restaurant out west. Check it out.

The Henry has the best vibe.  Stopped in for a quick protein shake and coffee with some teammates and a meeting on their patio. I've eaten here before but today wasn't for that. Everyone's doing their own thing, it reminds me of college in the quad....oh to be young again.

I'm a bit of a purist. I worked for chickfila when I was 16. I had a great time there. It's always clean, the food is quality and the ticket times are under 2min. I'm never disappointed. Keep up the good work

This family of a restaurant always exceeds our expectations. They all share in the responsibility of making sure we are comfortable. The wait was slightly shorter than quoted but the waiting area with misters made life easy, even with the infant. There was a second overflow wait area with similar accommodations on the other side of the bar. Someone brought us waters and chips while we waited. A server came buy to grab our drink order. Once we had our table the host met us on the walk over there and our tab was combined without question. EASY! This happens every time we come in. The food was perfect. Bean burrito and rice for the little one, enchiladas for myself and tacos for the lady. Had a little elote as a snack and life was good. Love this place.

Awkward place.  Ordering was fine but seemed limited but it was cool that they cooked right in front of you.  If it were just an in and out Taco shop I'm sure I would've been happy but when we went to the other room to sit down and everything's dirty and under construction it just takes away from the feel.  I'm hoping to update this once all the changes are done and it can feel clean and comfortable.

Guys place!! Ok so I'm in Vegas. Walking the strip and drunkenly we find this place and it is packed. Obviously due to Guys cult following from TV. I never expect these places to be good. Any namesake restaurant usually falls flat. So we pass it up. In the morning we want breakfast/brunch so we laughingly come here because of the hoopla the night before.   Not only was the place good but it was great. They killed it. The bartenders were hilarious and helpful and put up with our sassy friend. We met some other vacationers and it was the perfect launching point for the day. Most everyone bit on the steak breakfast and it was fun that they served it with a watermelon gazpacho. The gazpacho was so good that my friend turned it into a 55oz mimosa. It was amazing!!!! The bartenders charged our buddy's phone and before giving it back took a bunch of hilarious pictures.  You should def go here to start your day off because everyone will make you smile and the food is very reasonable and delicious.

Had to get chest X-rays for bronchitis. Whomp.   I was literally here for 10min. I came without an appointment. Got in and out even with others waiting ahead of me. They may have been in for more complicated things. The guy scanning me was quick and professional.   He said I had long lungs. News to me!!! Hurray lungs.   No more bronchitis. Thanks for the quick job.

Drove by a few times j. The past few months and always read Mother Brunch. Lol I'm a dumb dumb. Anyhow, we came in and were greeted immediately and taken to our table. Our server was a delight. He was very flamboyant and exciting to take suggestions from. Also his quads were on point. In a non weird way, just appreciate the time it takes to get good quads.  He guided us around the menu. Had some wings, a steak sandwich and the usual no tomato, no cilantro no onion dish for my lady. The kiddo had a heaping bowl of mac and cheese and we were brought a couple beers that were recommended.   All in all a good spot downtown. It was fun, the food was good the beer selection was ample. Check it out.

Solid performance from a suburban donut shop! Plenty of different options that range from the classic to the creative.  Definitely try the apple pie donut.  Enjoyed the Nutella cronut but thought the cronut itself was a little flaky and dry.   Red velvet is the kiddos fav but he thinks it's strawberry. Gotta work on his taste buds but at least he's not color blind.  The only thing I needed was the kolache to be hot.  Unless you ask for it warmed it'll come cold.  I should've known but in Texas they offer the heating if they don't regularly or they just do it.  Hot sausage and cheese always wins.

Jalapeño burger and cold beer!!!!  Stopped in between bar hopping for some shuffleboard. The table is a little uneven so maybe use the quarters you charge to level that thing out. No problem for a shuffleboard pro, gotta weigh in the elements in your game play. Lol kidding! Had a good time. Snacked on a bunch of items and the service was great. Everyone else grubbed on some wings and we're all happy with their choices.

Great call when wanting a different take on the build your own sandwich life. Been a fan of potbelly for some time.  Went with the pizza Sammie! Their cookies are always soft and tastes fresh baked. Had a great talk with the Sammie artist and felt good as I left. Keep it up.

A fun little adventure spot. Time to get down and dirty so don't wear your Sunday best. Lots of options for some hand grubbed and finger lickin good times. I recommend the shrimp and blue crab but eating blue crab is no simple task. Grab a couple beers and while you're at it wrote on the walls. A fun place for the kiddos too!

Cool clean dive bar. Local beers at great prices. Bartender pointed us in the right direction with the drafts and specials. A good amount of people playing games and such for an afternoon drink. Shark week rocked! Had sports on another! Good laughs and cold beers at a great price. Will def be back.

I was torn between and three and a four here. There is a lot of possibility to be a five and the ideas and execution are so close. They've been around for a bit and most of my inner circle come here every now and then. This was my first visit and prob not my last. I can say with a little focus on the small details in sure people would come back more often.  Positives: They have one of the best menus for a Latin inspired menu, both drink and food. There are abundant options for vegetarians and the omnivores.   Mexican Mule: perfectly balanced and jam packed with flavor. Watermelon Mint Marg: I thought the lime was a bit strong but a very refreshing summer cocktail. ***Brussels Sprout Nachos: this is such a winning dish.  Everything about this dish is gold. It needed a tad bit of self seasoning as only the chips had salt, but once we set it up we were all about it. Must Try!*** Sonoran Hot Dog: the brioche bun makes this dish.  I could passed on the bacon as always because I can really stand bacon. But the hot dog was perfectly cooked and had such good flavor with the cheese and beans and everything!  Negatives: Watermelon lime sno-cone: a couple steps annoyed me about this guy. They advertise it on their marquee. It actually drew me in and got me so fired up. It was the first thing I ordered when I sat down. It took a bit of time to make it because they hadn't shaved any ice, prob because they were slow and didn't want to have it melt yada yada. Then once it came it was kinda lame. Hard to drink/eat and stained my face red lol. I also hated he paper straw as it would get clogged with watermelon. It's cute but needs more fine tuning for execution.  Ambiance: many old town restaurants bank on location for success and let their eyes drop from the details. Tvs off while being open, tile floors that haven't been power washed in way too long. The floors are not originally black. And walls that are originally white just covered in scuffs and wear and tear. Look at website pics it's beautiful. If they put a tad bit of cleaning into the patio details this place will remain a gem.

Love this place. I bring the nephew here from our west in sun city every other month.  His two favorite things chicken and donuts. I think he's convinced there is chicken in the donuts but whatever, who am I to ruin his dream of Santa, Hogwarts or Chicken donuts.  Not me.  I grabbed a breakfast Sammie this week and bought a shirt. The crew is happy, friendly and don't make you feel bad for not reading the menu completely. I'd have loved to try the ramen but it's only available on the weekends.  If you get lunch make sure to grab a pack of donuts with assorted flavors to spread the word of this awesome gem and because you should be a good person to those around you. But donuts, get more friends.

There's a name they give their regulars and while I may not be one in Tempe I am at their location off Camelback.  I love the breakfast tacos when I added sausage and I blow through a few vanilla lattes and mmmmimosas. The service staff is the best especially when seated at the bar, you get casual and attentive service and the managers usually swing by to say hey and make sure life is good.  Check out the daily pancake because usually it's the most creative and legit inspiration to start your day.

Came here on a whim and we were pleas entry surprised for a little late night grub down. Everyone here is very Italian which is seemingly great. The food options were on point. They have a wood fire oven in he back that is clearly manned by someone that has done this before. The wine list was slightly limited but sufficient and he ambiance was energetic without being rambunctious. Not sure if it's in my top places to get to but I'd def recommend it to a friend looking for some good grub late night.

10x better than the first visit. We stopped in by chance one of the days they first opened and it felt incomplete. No lunch menu and limited options. Today was a 180. Had fresh juices, the counter server offered her favorite and it had very nice balance to it. Ordered the spinach and mushroom omelette and it was perfectly cooked. The cheese and mixins were abundant and the fruit bowl was substantial.  I like the toast they use, lots of grains and flavor. I was playing with the baby and letting him eat some fruit and they brought us over a brownie. Nice people, maybe Spanish decent. Just a true love for hospitality and care for the guests in the building. Great job!

Amazing concept here. Almost like food truck town in a brick and mortar. I went to The Yardbird and it was so ridiculously good. Expectations exceeded. I sat at the counter and watched chef prep and cook the meal. He suggested the fried quail and biscuit and it was on point. I'm not a good snob but when it comes to well balanced flavor I fall in L O V E. The gravy was the most legit I have had and being from the south o have eaten a lot of gravy. I finished it off with a cream soda and his spicy brussels. I'll check out other places on the market but not without grabbing something from his place first.

I think I have the five star review to desoto market but this is the place to be. This is the reason i would come back. I described my visit in the other review so I'll wrap it up here. It's amazing. Chef talks to you and makes the right suggestions. He told me the way to go was the fried quail and biscuit. He wasn't lying. The grave as out of this world. I'd have preferred real cutlery vs plastic because I was seated at the bar top but that's so minor to me. I'd have eaten everything with my fingers to get another biscuit. I'll def be back to try other dishes on his menu. Keep up the great work.

The line here is atrocious for the drive thru. Your best bet is just to park behind and walk in. No ones in there.  So unless you have a kid in your backseat, jump out. The staff is fun and friendly. The new app that I downloaded has helped a lot, even earned a free coffee. Wish it was all built in the app but I had to show my card etc etc. small tech kinks still to work out.

Not sure what happened this visit. Been here twice before and usually sit at the bar.  I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish but there was not enough server presence on the floor. We came right around 1015a. It seemed as if our server had way too many tables spread out. They were out of multiple dishes and drinks that I was trying to order. Which is fine. Just adjust the menu or just do a better job ordering. It slows the server down to go back and forth and puts the guest in an awkward situation to have to order on the spot. Food was decent as it has been before. Tried to modify the burrito but was told they were premade. Huh? At a place that has an increased check average and a large kitchen making items from scratch what's the benefit to precooking eggs and rolling them in a burrito. We eat out often with our two year old and we play the get in and get out game.  We order a bunch of food and our drinks fast so in return get us our check and bus our table. We literally had to get up, go to the host stand and ask for our bill so we could scram.   Dial in uniforms. Dirty, sloppy appearances is a tragedy. Stained wrinkled shirts and hair everywhere on support staff is off putting.  Oh just to hook you up with my last bit of annoying advice...the pictures in the main dining room look great but are hung crooked. So a three piece ensemble looks bad not lined up.

I'm learning my beer palate isn't quite up to or with my wine, cocktail and food palate. I have a hard time telling why good beer and bad beer is. Most of its preference to me at this point.  With that being said we came here on Memorial Day and it was surprisingly slow.  I felt that last year the restaurant/bar world was busier on this weekend. I'm guessing it's because school has been out for a couple weeks now and people have finally left the valley. But score for us. Great friendly service, ample room for the kiddo to run around and explore. Their are cornhole bags and a beautiful outside bar. The inside was slightly busier with a beautiful view of their brewing facility.   Had the most popular ipa, the hef, a pale ale and a porter. All were solid choices. Served I. Proper glassware and complimented by fatness of quest, guac, garlic burger and snacks of my partners plate. The kiddo nibbled here and there. The salsa had a bit of chipotle and was a nice change and compliment with the ipa to start off with.   I'm saying, come here. Enjoy yourself and have a good time.

Love this place.   I'll be stopping in again today for avocado hummus and one of their many delicious bowls.  If you get the Mother Earth ask for extra sauce. I think it's a red pepper sauce and it's phenomenal.  The lady loves to get a turkey wrap with avocado and she's definitely picky. It's says a lot about their food and drink.  Plenty of killer desserts for us fat kids and I'm a professional lemonade mystery taste tester and their's passed the test.  Keep it up!

The newest in town and they do it right.  The front facing street to the complex is still under construction as they finalize the remainder of businesses that will be going in the complex but Okra is open for dinner starting at 4pm.    It's a little taste of Louisiana with some trendy hip charm. Both bartenders were pretty straight up guys. We talked sports as I admired their delicious pineapple propeller.  It's a very well balanced drink with a fun garnish.   I sampled three dishes. 1. Namesake grilled okra. It was fine as far as okra goes. There was no spark here. I enjoyed that it was just a fried cliche plate but I guess I wanted more from the sauce drizzled on top. 2. Pork lardons and collared greens. This dish was awesome. It had a slight spice to it and I shoveled it in my mouth. Seriously delicious. 3. Bone marrow. I'm naturally a straight up carnivore and this dish brings it out of me. Spread the marrow and the jam on the biscuit and life is good.  There are still plenty of items I still need to try so I'm sure I'll be seeing you in here.

Ohhhhhweeee! What a find! Pulled up the ole yell. Typed in breakfast. Drove into a tiny lot in a neighborhood and walked out a happy happy family. Didn't know what to expect for counter service breakfast. The place is cute and you walk by the chef cooking. Once I totaled my bill I thought, this mom and pop place better be good. We had our coffees and walked out front. Small but cute and near the street. We let the kiddo run amuck. I went to the restroom to wash my hands and found a back patio that was enclosed and well decorated. So we took a bench out there when breakfast came I was flavor blasted. I had a blue corn biscuit thing with eggs and yummy salsa. The other was more of a sweet bread and marscapone egg dish. I ate 90% of both entrees. The kid ran around and didn't bother anyone! It was Perfect! Chef killed it. We will def be back.

Yes! Yes! Yes! This has easily become a favorite amongst the friends and coworkers. While the aren't open as late as most bars they still bring to the table a cool place to drink, socialize and kick back with your friends to dream about the days and games of old. Be prepared for a line at battletoads and have your game face ready at nba jam.  Not sure if it were permanent or an opening thing but I didn't even use a quarter for a game, just kept by brew full and honed my skills at the joystick.

I'm loving my membership at Keep it Cut. 30$ a month and I can come however often I want at any location. I tried out Tempe and my stylist killed it.  He hardly used the clippers. He was all scissor and technique.  Felt good and love how easy it is to get in and get out without awkward convo.  Thanks again team.

Had a good time with a buddy getting a couple beers and some late night grub. Went with the bartender recommended burger. Had good flavor but a little weak on the bun game. Fell apart pretty quickly but went caveman style and knocked it out. Buddy ordered the chicken kabobs. Came out looking good enough for other bar guests to get intrigued. Only feedback would be for them to lower the lights or adjust them so the ambiance gets a better feel. Seemed like most were turned too high up and made it slightly weird feeling inside. Don't underestimate light bulbs.

The location is their biggest struggle but the execution of delicious desserts is spot on. Started following hem on social media and all their concoctions look too notch. It's slightly tucked away in a small pointless shopping enter with bad signage but that must be overcome so your mouth and tummy can get a taste of what's going on here.  Didn't taste anything just dove straight in.  Went with the urkkel(sp?). Anything related to family matters circa 1995 is a must try. It was perfect. Added a fruity pebble macaroon which wasn't my first choice but they were out of the caramel. They threw on a toasted marshmallow that they brûléed right there and I was off to dessert nirvana. My counterpart went with a small scoop of Netfix and chill. We both voted mine to be the champ but her popcorn treat was different and fun.

Was here for the opening.  I like the ambiance, the outside patio is set up nicely, when you walk in you see the open kitchen and the bar in the back. I choose bar like always but will sit along the kitchen side next time.    They have a great selection of beers, wines and cocktails to partake in. The menu is clever and unique and pairs wines with each item. Great call as most Arizona diners are learning to be a bit more progressive.    Tried out four items. I'm such a pig. A. Curried cauliflower, beautiful dish. Needed a tad bit of salt but the flavors were fantastic. B. Short rib steak - not my favorite. I usually prefer a slower cooked short rib that melts the fat and falls apart. This was a tad chewy and lackluster. C. Grilled octopus - I would pass on this. The size of the octopus was large and it was served with a couple fingerling potatoes. No real sauce and not very tender. D. DESSERT! - they have a pastry they cook in the brick oven. I am spacing on the name. But it's apple my delicious! I alone at the whole dish. It's definitely going to bring me back.  All in all a good visit for a first day. Some small kinks but everyone was friendly and helpful and made for a great lunch. Nice to have more restaurants popping up in uptown.

A must on everyone's sweet tooth list. Tried to come by on Memorial Day and it was insane!!! People everywhere, line out the door! Had to come back and see what the fuss was about.   Limited seating so we did some parking lot playing. Popped the truck up and sat with our sammies. So many options, we weren't ready. Prepare before you come the line moves fast. Three options of donuts! Brownies or cookies as your "bread" and you can mix and match and here are so many flavors. Then pick out that ice cream filling and then finish it off with sprankles or toppings of choice. You can get it heated as well. And it's cheapppppp!  I think we went full fat kid and had so many toppings and flavors and it was around 4.50$ each! Legit!  The girls working were killing it so they don't chit chat too much, prob because their main goal is to attack the line. Great job! Maybe get a couple more outside tables. I'm also guessing y'all are planning your expansion! Let me know if you need help! I want in!

I'm surprised I haven't reviews this place before.  I've enjoyed it many times and Try out dishes you won't find anywhere else in Arizona.  I find their classics to be very classic and full of flavor so feel safe picking these out.  There weren't many small apps to complements my entree so I just went with it anyway at risk of looking like a fatty. Gumbo was solid and thick, poboy was decent. Loved the avocado toast just added a pinch more salt but true grapefruit really brought the dish to life.  The croique Monsieur was legit. By far my favorite dish.  The wine list is extensive and really brings into focus local wines, which aren't the best but appreciate the local push because they are good enough to enjoy for a casual lunch for sure.

The value alone makes this place a great choice and hangs up on your usual avenues in dining and drinking.   The ambiance is spot on. A nice wrap around bar in the center and tables surrounding. Stop cooled down and pretty perfectly placed for a sundown drink.   Ordered a lot so try and keep up.  Port of call - perfectly balanced sweet coupe cocktail.  Dog and pony show - quasi Moscow mule sub gin. Prob the easiest to drink when it's 100* out. A table favorite. Carolina red - personal favorite. Most flavored cocktail, I could see this as a hit or miss for most. Not a new drinkers cocktail. This guy has some heart to it. Solera gomez - Least favorite. But not bad, expected a tad bit more sweetness but had a touch too much bite for the group Remember the Alamo Pitcher - They have cocktail pitchers, multiple choices too. Really great idea. Fun way to share and commune. Def jump down this road because it's served in a classy glass and packs a bunch of flavor and balance.  Roasted cauliflower - solid side dish. A good amount of salt, perfectly cooked cauli, good texture with the breadcrumbs. Could've used more of the cream sauce. That stuff was legit. Salt cod tots - A fun little fish tater tot. A tad heavy on salt but two people at the table absolutely loved these. Ate every last bite. ****Beef tongue pastrami - By far my favorite dish. It's playful, full of flavor, perfectly cooked. I could eat this guy every day and still want more. **** Potted crab - not good. Most pricey app but he least favorite. Texture was too wet and soft. Crab was lost in the mix. Wouldn't get again. But definitely didn't ruin the experience of the place.  Overall I loved stock and stable. Small personal preferences prob knocked them down the one star but I'd recommend it to anyone. I'll def be back and do another gauntlet of food and drink soon. There is still around 30 other dishes and drinks to try. See y'all soon!
