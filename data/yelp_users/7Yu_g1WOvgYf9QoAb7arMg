LOVED the food at this place.  No doubt I'll make a trip back when I'm in town again.  Bonus points for having a habanero salsa option, too.

I had time to check out one brewery while visiting the Phoenix area.  Unfortunately, good Yelp reviews led me to Dubina.    I had a 5 beer flight, and honestly not even one of them was an average level beer.  Carbonation on all seemed low, nothing was incredibly true to style, and the barelywine was flat out horrible.  If I had to pick a least offensive, it'd be their brown.  It was fine.  Beyond the really awful beer, the place has a weird vibe.  Dark & generic.  Shades pulled, drop ceiling, couches.  Weirdly open space.  I didn't get what they were going for.  I kind of assumed the decor came from a previous business that used the space, maybe.  The service started out good, but it took forever to get the check.  Asked for it, but the server waited on other tables for about 15 minutes before bringing it back.  The owner actually ended up handling it for us, as she was going around talking to the tables.  The good?  Prices were okay, especially during happy hour.  The pretzel was decent, and the food looked good.  One of the owners also dropped by to chat and she was a lovely woman.    I wish this place the best of luck, but the beer has a long way to go.  Dial back the ambition on the higher gravity beers and try to get a few simpler styles first, maybe.
