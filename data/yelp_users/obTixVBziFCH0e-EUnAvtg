You may notice that many of my reviews are 5 star; that's just because it's more fun to write about great experiences like Villa Montessori than it is a bad experience. Villa is a God-send for my daughter Kylee. Kylee attended Hopi for a couple of years and it just wasn't working.  We moved Kylee over to Villa beginning in 4th grade and she immediately loved it. She is blossoming as a reader and is having fun with her assignments in the Montessori environment.  The student to teacher ration is really great. Kylee's classroom of 28 students has a teacher and TWO full time assistants. At hopi Kylee was really struggling, and at VM she has not only become a better student, but also a more confident, assertive, and creative little girl. The 28th Street campus across from Camelback High School is brand new and the setting is just lovely. I feel good about taking Kylee to school here. She is learning, she is safe, and she is loved there. What more could a parent ask for! Hat's off to Villa Montessori. If I could give it 6 stars I would.

I live in the neighborhood, and so I have had the good fortune of having Vincents Market Bistro in my backyard. Without exageration I have probably eaten here at least 50 times over the years and have NEVER had a disappointing meal.   From the egg-in-a-hole for breakfast to the lovely Coq au vin , lamb shank, or Beef Bourguignon for lunch or dinner the menu is always rich.   My Top 5 Reasons I Love Vincent's Market Birsto  ~ Lovely lovely food. Way way above the ordinary. ~ Price. You can expect to pay $7 - $10 bucks a plate. ~ Location.........40th & Camelback ~ Service. Always cordial, and always snappy. Always  ~ Free desert. Usually a small slice of fruit tart with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Looks aren't everything.......  This little divito looks a little scary looking, but like I've said before "you can't judge a book by it's cover".   Not necessarily the kind of place you will take your date (unless she's blind and hungry), but man oh man is the food ever good!   We have ordered breakfast, lunch, & dinner, and it is all fantastico. They make home-made corn tortillas and several salsas. The breakfast burritos are out of this world and cost about the same as a McDonald's meal.   We are a family that eats out frequently and we are frankly tired of pretty places with below average food. This place is sure to cure your hankerin for a tasty Mexican meal.

Healthy, yummy, reasonable price. What's not to like. BTW, the margaritas are abfab too. Guacamole is not that watered down stuff, and all of the meats seem to be free of grizzle which requires labor to sort through the good, the bad, & the ugly. We eat out frequently and this place gets a visit from us at least twice a month.

My wife and I love our home. 13 years ago we bought it and sought out advice from various experts. Cathy Hayes was among the greatest advisors we know. The decisions that we made with Cathy are what makes us love our home all these years later.   She really helped us zero in on what would make our home unique and wonderful. We even made a couple of trips with her to LA to select furniture and art pieces. It didn't cost us a fortune, and the results are worth far more than gold.  Cathy was patient, and kind, and fair (three of my favorite characteristics).  If you are in need of a great visionary then Hayes Inc Architecture and Interiors has to top your list.

We go for the salads a-lot. The chicken and tuna salads are great. Simple and hearty. They always give you plenty to eat and the greens are always fresh. Sannies are good too. Not quite the same as the Duck & Decanter, but still better than most.

This place is wayyyy to good to get anything less than a 5 star review. It has it all: friendly and attentive staff, stunning environment, and beautiful food.  Don't miss this place. It's a real gem.  I've been going here for years. Today we took my daughter there for her 12th birthday. We brought 4 of here closest friends. Once the food arrived the table got quiet; nothing but the sound of eating until every last speck of food was gone.  After that we retreated to the grassy area under the pecan trees fro a game of touch football.   What a great Saturday morning.

Arizona Fire & Water Restoration is the company I pull out of my bag of tricks when one of my customers (I'm a local real estate agent) needs to deal with an unforseen emergency like a flood or fire.  I met Jim Doorley from AZ Fire & Water when he was referred to me from JoEllen James at State Farm. Insurance companies deal with these unpredictable events all the time and I've known JoEllen for 10 years; I guess you could say I trust her recommendations completely.  Right away when I met Jim I could tell that he is a great and personable resource for my to have for my clients. I have AZ Fire & Water on my app right now where my clients can access all of my vendors at the click of a button. I give Arizona Fire & Water a BIG thumbs up!

I just had Precise do some service work on an a/c for a client of mine. I got 3 other bids. Precise did have the lowest bid. They showed up on time They did the work. They left the place cleaner than they found it. I would recommend Precise Mechanical and Lorri over and over again. Great company. Great owner. Great technicians.  Thank you Lorri for coming through for us. I will continue to refer you to my friends and clients.

As a Coldwell Banker agent I am very careful about who I refer to my clients. Cummings Termite & Pest Control is one of the companies that I feel comfortable referring. Recently Cummings Termite & Pest Control hired Debbie Burnett a well known Arizona professional pest inspection specialist. This was a smart move.  I whole heatedly recommend that anyone needing a fair, honest, and professional pest/termite inspection call Cummings Termite & Pest Control and request that they send Debbie Burnett to the rescue!

You Can't Judge a Book By it's Cover  If looks were everything this place gets all the stars. But, just like people, it's what's on the inside that counts. I was given a few gift cards to Chelsea's Kitchen, so we have ordered several times from the menu; the food we had was sub-par every time.   Top 3 reasons we did NOT like Chelsea's kitchen   ~ The entrees were not very good. Nothing was worth going back for.  ~ The food sometimes arrived cold  ~ Pricepoint. We eat out a-lot, so price matters to us.   Top 3 things we liked about the joint  ~ The place is gorgeous; architecture and  design is wonderful  ~ Service. These people don't skip a beat. Service is snappy with a smile  ~ Fabulous location at 40th & Camelback.

My mom is from Santa Fe. I lived in New Mexico for over 20 years. I have eaten my way up and down the entire state of New Mexico. I have eaten at every well known and every hidden little dive in that state. So I think that my opinion should carry a little weight (just my 2 cents).  The food at Dick's Hideaway is on par with the very best in Santa Fe. All of the dishes are made from scratch. I don't think there is anything in that kitchen that has ever seen a can. Every time I eat there I don't wanna brush my teeth for a few days so I can lick my chops and relive the  whole thing all over again.  I plan to go there this Saturday morning again, and invited my two brothers to join me. We will all enjoy Huevos Rancheros, over medium eggs, with beans and fried potatoes smothered in beautiful dark red New Mexican red chile..YUM!!!

FOOD POISONING We decided to see a 6:30 pm movie at AMC Dine-in Theatres Esplanade 14. My daughter spent the previous 48 hours at her grandmothers, so the only food that my wife (Shawn) and daughter ate together in the last 48 hours was the mac and cheese at the AMC Dine-in Theatres Esplanade 14.   We went to see a kids movie with my daughter Kylee and her friend. Tickets for the 4 of us were $42. We justified it because of the comfortable seating and food service in the theater. Sure we could have waited for the movie to hit NetFlix, but we wanted to make the evening special. And boy was it ever!  On the way home Kylee  and Shawn talked about how bad the food tasted and we decided to keep it to drinks only in the future because of how poor the food is at the Theater. Little did we know that the food we were complaining about would be coming up again later that night.  My wife flew out of the bed at about midnight and made a mad dash for the toilet. She was in a cold sweat and groaning with pain from her abdominal section. She said she was afraid she was going to pass out. We'll pass on describing what was coming out of her body and where. Finally, after about 45 minutes she made it back to bed feeling like Rocky Balboa had been in the ring with her for 12 rounds.  I figured that we were past all this now and the family would finally get some much needed rest. We soon entered into REM only to be awoken within the hour. It was my daughter. She was vomiting while sitting on the toilet. Same symptoms that Shawn had. Eventually we all went back to bed. We were worried that Kylee's friend who went to the movie with us was going to be next. Luckily she did not eat the mac. I did not eat at the theater, so I was out of the woods.  Conclusion: we didn't mind spending $100+ for a family evening of fun. However, we will not be doing any eating in the AMC Dine-in Theatres Esplanade 14 again. I don't know what goes on in that kitchen behind the scenes, and frankly don't want to know.  Recommendation: Watch more movies at home

I'm a real estate agent and when my client came top me asking who I would recommend to clean his carpet I decided to do some research. I noticed that F & F Carpet Cleaning has a five star rating with over 70 reviews on Yelp.   I called F & F. They set the appointment. They showed up on time. They gave me a price before starting the work. And the results are really good.   I'm so happy with F & F that I have decided to include them on my full time vendor app that I share with my clients. Now all of my clients and friends will know that I recommend F & F.

I met Jayson very recently at a business function and made an appointment to meet with him so that I could learn more about his insurance agency. We spent about 2 hours chatting about business and shared ideas.  Before I left his office Jayson examined my current insurance policy and made some suggestions that had never occurred to me before. Once of the best things about the review was that he never once pressured me to buy from him. He simply shared information and pointed out some strategies that will afford me superior protection for about the same amount of money that I am now spending with my current agent.  If you are not sure about your current policy and the kind of coverage that you have you should run (not walk) to your phone and give Jayson a call. I know that he can help you save money and get the best coverage possible.  Thank you Jayson!

Dr. Behbahani has been caring for my 11 year old daughter's teeth for some time now. Her experience is always good. With other dentists she had fear, and more pain than she should have. At Central Valley Dentistry the staff is always warm, and the patient is never rushed.  If I could give the doctor & his staff 10 stars I would!

I have purchased again, and again, and again from Spencer's. Why? Because I know that I am going to get more than a great price. The knowledgeable staff make the difference for me. I bet you that Dave Kollman, my salesperson, really knows more about dishwashers than just about anyone on planet earth. I told him what I needed and he found the perfect machine for me.  Tomorrow I am having a brand new Bosch dishwasher installed in my home. Dave has been with Spencer's for over 15 years. He knows all of the product in the store and will find the best  appliance at the best price for your need. If you hire anyone other than Spencer's and Dave Kollman to help you with appliances you must be crazy!  I appreciate the great service I have received from this excellent valley company.

I'm eating chicken handy. I think it might be the best chicken dish I've ever eaten! This place is nothing to look at, but the food is absolutely off the hook. The spice combinations are like nothing I've ever tried before. Come in here when you're hungry and you'll be delighted with your meal I promise.  I wish I was still hungry so I could eat it all over again right now

I bought a Groupon for 3 different Crossfit trial memberships. I am two weeks into my first month long trial here are Crossfit Full Strength.  Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly (just a fun way of saying I'm telling the truth here):  1) Is the workout good? Darned right it is. I started here out of shape. The members are a smattering of newbies and  long time crossfitters I was able to fit right in without slowing the class down. The coaches made adjustments to my workout so that I could receive the benefits of the Crossfit routine. I love the variety of exercise and leave every workout totally spent.  2) The staff are already  aware of where I am at (only after 2 weeks) and they constantly come by and provide coaching on the movements for each excercise.  3) Motivation. The other members are friendly, fun, encouraging, and helpful. It's kind of like a big family; everyone wants to see all the members succeed. The owner is there a-lot. She stays in constant contact with us via email and does a great job running her gym.  4) The place. Ok, it's not The Village and it's not 24 hour Fitness. It ain't pretty. It's all about the workout, the end result, and helping the members stay on track. If you want to buy a cheap one year membership where they don't care about you (actually most gyms hope you buy the membership and never come back) you can find that kind of thing all across the valley. This place is the real deal.  5) More about the place: Rumor has it that the owner is on the hunt for a new location with a much bigger space.  Bottom line: If you are looking for a place that will get you fit and challenge your limits this is a great choice. I will be "testing" out two other crossfit gyms within the next three months and will update my opinion once I have experienced the other two places. If you are looking for a great place to get it done near 40th & Thomas you have to give this box a try.

This place has to get all five stars. Ok, the area is a little suspect I will admit; that can be countered with the excellent food and excellent prices. This is the kind of food that goes for $12 - $15/plate if it were located in an upscale area.  They have done a great job with the interior and the food is really wonderful.  5 Top reasons I love La Condesa:  ~ Beautiful food. Unique flavors.   ~ Great salsa bar: aver a dozen lovely hand made salsas; I liked them all  ~ Price: you can spend under $7 and have a really good meal  ~ Convelient: It is only a 2 minute drive from 24th & Camelback.  ~ Atmosphere: the interior and the service create a great place to dine.  ***We eat out several times a week, and this place is now at the top of the list for my wife and I both.***

It is easy to brag about Steve Jarosh at MidFirst Bank. He is the Vice President/East Valley Business Banking Manager. Steve understands how important it is that  business owners and commercial real estate investors be able to have access to the financing they need to fuel the flames of their business visions.  Four top reasons I recommend Steve:  ~ Service minded and business acumen  ~ He can help you borrow up to $10 Million  ~ MidFirst is Financially sound (not all banks are, as you know)  ~ Strong SBA lender

Lanza Home Theater & Security was able to quickly help us configure some components that another video & video contractor was not able to. Scott came in, was neat as a pin, polite, pleasant, and knowledgeable. When we had questions/concerns he was responsive. Most importantly our system works great and we know who to call if we need a professional in this field.

I just had a bunch of work done on a rental home I am managing. I discussed the job with several other plumbers before I met Freddy. Freddy provided an estimate within 24 hours of calling. His price was lower than the other quotes I got, and he did an outstanding job. He was neat, and cleaned up after himself. He is polite, and well spoken.   I will keep Freddy on my speed dial. In fact, I also have him on my JohnC app that I give all my clients access to. I am very cautious about who I refer and am happy to be able to have Freddy on my list.   If you need a plumber call Freddy. Freddy will save you money and do the job right.

Every two weeks I meet with a group of friends at Seasons 52. We get to dine in Biltmore Fashion Park and we enjoy a tasty menu of beautiful healthy food for around $10 bucks a plate (some for less).  The service is consistently outstanding and that's not easy to do with a large group. The food is served on time, it's always hot, and it never disapoints.

Jimmy John's gets 5 stars because they earned every one of them. They do everything right:  ~ the bread (it's the best) ~the cold-cuts (sliced on site, no low-grade Subway ingredients here!) ~lightening fast service. A nice sanny made from scratch at the blink of an eye. ~Totally affordable. My budget sub sanny is a Slim # 5 (salami & cheese) and it runs me a whopping $3.83 with tax!

The Problem: The idea of taking Fido to the "kennel" freaks us out almost as it does Fido himself. We know that Fido is going to get the most basic of needs met at "the kennel", but we also know that he thinks it sucks. We know that he isn't happy about being there. He remembers the last stay at the kennel and maybe that's why he whines and whimpers as we drive up to the place? Maybe that's why he has to practically be dragged into the kennel?   The Solution: PupTent Alternative Pet Boarding After leaving Fido with a PupTent participant you might have to drag him back home when you come to pick him up! He just spent several days being loved and pampered by someone who was able to enjoy him and care for him and love him almost as much as you do!  To learn more about how PupTent can make your doggy a happy camper when you are away see this quick video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0o5FCkCsvY

As a Coldwell Banker real estate professional I amvery cautious about the services I refer my clients to.  JoEllen James & State Farm are one team that I feel great about  endorsing.  One thing we want from an insurance agent is EVERYTHING, right? Well, JoEllen James just might be the closest thing there is to the perfect insurance agent: smart, organized, compassionate, educated, understanding, and competitive as all get-out!

I have the good pleasure of becoming friends with an Iraqi guy named Omar. I am representing Omar as his real estate agent and we have become chummy as we are scouting for his new home. Yesterday I asked Omar where we could get some Iraqi homecookin here in Phoenix. He smiled and we were off to Semiramis. My top 5 reasons to try Semiramis:  ~ Authenticity:      This is the real deal for Middle Eastern Cusine ~ Hospitality:       Andy is the owner, and it feels like you are eating in his home ~ Environment:   Simple, not pretentious.  ~ Friendly:            More than a place to eat. People gather here for dominoes,   socializing, and food. ~ Convenience:  Located on the SW corner of Bell & 24th street

My CPA is retiring soon, so I thought I'd better get out there and meet a few so that I can pick the best one when that dreaded day comes that my current CPA retires. I was really worried about finding the right person. It's an industry where you expect to meet really smart people with not so great personal skills. So I was prepared for lackluster.   I was actually, kind of dreading the process. Anyhow, I met with the first of three candidates: Wanda E. O'Malley. Here's how that went: she absolutely knocked my socks off. I'm actually looking forward to my current CPA's retirement now. Wanda is super approachable. she is an excellent listener who knows how to really be present with the person she is talking to. That alone scores HUGE points in my book. It seems that when most people are in conversation they are thinking about what they want to say next instead of actually engaging and truly listening. SO that tells me that Wanda will be all over the details when it's time to take over our taxes.   As a local real estate agent, I get plenty of requests for referrals for various professionals, and it will be a pleasure to refer Wanda E. O'Malley at every opportunity. One last thing to note: I did a little digging, and discovered that not only  has Wanda graduated with an accounting degree, she actually graduated as Magna Cum Laude of her class. Pretty impressive. Give it a go with Wanda E. O'Malley CPA when you have accounting needs; I'm sure you will be glad you did.

First of all, I really wish I could rate this place higher; our neighborhood really could use some good bbq and seafood. Here's our experience: My wife & I were quickly seated, and our waitress quickly got to our table and explained how things work at the Angry Crab. At this point we're thinking we are in for a good meal. Drinks were served right away and we looked forward to the arrival of the food. This is where things went downhill.   My meal arrived first. I ordered the brisket which was not good. It was mooshy and tasteless aside from the bbq sauce that was ladled onto the meat right before it arrived. The meat tasted like it may have been boiled before it was put into the smoker. If you want to taste the real thing head to south Phoenix and try Little Miss BBQ (it's a TEN). I did eat most of the brisket because I was hungry. I give it a 3 out of 10. Bummer.  After I completely finished my meal my wifes diner arrived. Timing not so good.   She ordered battered shrimp. We expect deep fried anything to have some oil on it since it is submerged in the stuff until cooked. Problem here was that the fries tasted like shrimp, so we think it is all deep fried together. Also, the batter held onto too much of the grease. It left a heavy after taste. The corn that was served was COLD, not like it had become cold by sitting, but cold as if just taken out of the fridge cold (yuk!).   I brought a pulled pork sanny home for  my daughter. I tasted the pork once home: same mooshy boiled flavor the brisket had. It was not something I would order again. Sorry guys.  The drinks were great and Rachel provided great service. I really want this place to work, so I am going to give it another try. I will order the crab and shrimp boil next time I go in. I hope it is good. I can tell they are trying, so the place has a chance since the owners and staff seem to be putting out effort. Sometimes all it takes is a little honest feedback and positive response for a restaurant to really make a splash.

Wowowowowow, what a sannie! Hook Me Up, where gourmet and bountiful intersect. My sandwich was beautifully done. The pesto sauce, bacon, pepperoni, roasted turkey and nicely toasted hoggie roll sent my taste buds into overdrive.   I don't live in Chandler, but if I did I would have this place on speed dial for sure. Sharon, the owner, is delightful. The staff is courteous, and the place is super clean.   Oh, and one last thing: obey your sweet-tooth. Don't walk outta this place without one of Sharon's signature milkshakes in your hand. It's thick and creamy and made with the real thing (I watched them make it). Your tummy will thank you. If you happen to live near 32nd street & Camelback I'd like to ask you to Hook Me Up & bring me one too.....:0)

Very corporate. Cali roll was super fishy ( that's never a good sign). If you like franchise dining this place could do in a pinch. We (3 of us) had rice bowls with chicken. The bowls were not terrible, but they weren't great either.   The sauce was like maple syrup sweet. I did not eat very much of my rice bowl and neither did my family. We won't be running back for more.

To me the food is bordering "institutional". It's a notch or two above Denny's. We have some 5 Star breakfast options in the area like Vincent's Bistro, and La Grande Orange. Coming soon we'll have Matt's Big Breakfast.   Quite honestly, I don't understand how a place like First Watch will survive the competition. On a positive note, the decor is quite nice and makes for a decent place to meet for a business conversation with a safe, but nothing special meal.   Sorry First Watch; I was hoping that you'd make a better addition to the neighborhood.

Looking forward to trying it again in about a month. Hoping they can make some changes before I go back.   When we got there (about 6:45pm) they had run out of bbq, except for chicken. So I had me some chicken. I give the chicken 5 stars; it was absolutely delicious, and priced fairly (1/2 lb for $8. So, they have at least one main dish right. The rest of my experience was lack-luster. Here's what went wrong:    ISSUES: ~ staff unorganized. This is not the fault of the staff; this is a management issue. Why open a place if it's not organized? ~ they ran out of bbq! I know it's cheaper to run out than it is to make a little extra, but it isn't very nice for the customer to only have one option ~ side dishes were good (green chili mac-n-cheese, and coleslaw), but severely overpriced. Those two sides cost us $6 and the portions were really small. Suggestion: if you are going to have small side dishes, just include it with the main course instead of jabbing everyone for every morsel on their plate. ~the bar didn't have basic liquors; just knock off brands. Also, what's a bbq place without beer on tap? ~ when we placed our order at the counter the process was not organized.  ~ pet peeve: hate it when I stand in line to order and the receipt I am supposed to sign has a line for a tip. I like to have my food served before I issue a tip. Isn't the reward supposed to come after the service?   I'm going to give this place another go in a month or so. If they can make a few corrections it could go from below average to great. In my opinion there's a-lot of work needed to achieve that goal. I want it to work. We need a great bbq place in these parts. Need a lesson on how? Go have a meal at Little Miss BBQ in South Phoenix. People stand in line there for the privilege of having great BBQ because it's that darned good.
