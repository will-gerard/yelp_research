I have no idea where the boyfriend found this place but he suggested for us to go here and we all loved it!   I had the bulgogi and katsu combo and I loved the katsu. It came out hot and crispy. Bulgogi was okay because I was expecting it to be Korean flavored but it wasn't so it threw me off a little. I would go for the teriyaki next time instead because my boyfriend had that and it was amaze-balls    All in all, we all enjoyed it and would definitely come back. The service was good and it didn't bother me that the decor was non existent but just wish the place was a little bigger because with all the tables, I felt a little cramped.

Definitely the last time I come here. I used to be a regular but now the customer service is so bad it's ridiculous. And ever since Richard the old owner left, the service only gotten worst and the food quality itself dropped. Spicy pork is full of fat. The bulgoli is dry and livery tasting. If the food was good and the service is bad, I would still man it out and come here but now that both is horrible, no reason in coming back. After 5 years it's time to say goodbye.

I LOVE how they give out a free samples every time we go in their store!  This place smells amazing! I don't recommend getting the peanut butter sundae though... Its like would you want some ice cream with your peanut butter? Even with 2 people we couldn't finish it cause its basically eating spoonfuls of peanut butter after another.   We also tried their brownie which taste more like fudge. And their massive cookie looks freaking delicious but expect it to be hard, not soft oogey gooey like how the cashier describes it.

If you want delicious boba tea, this is the place to get it! Don't forget to try the diamond ice!  I love going here because its so fun and upbeat. The graffiti on the walls are awesome to look at while waiting for my order.  I usually either get the lychee boba or passion fruit boba but recently I ventured out and tried their taro flavor. It definitely did not disappoint because I am now addicted and thats the one I choose every time I go now. It doesnt taste powdery at all. I actually like the taro more with lychee jelly then with boba =X But its freaking amazing!   Also don't forget to try their diamond ice. You cant go wrong with shaved ice, fresh fruits, and condensed milk! I love the redbean also. I would go here 3 times a day just for it. You'll be surprised how big a mini is and its definitely share-able since they put out extra bowls out for you.   I just wish they have a punch card or something. It would be nice to get a free drink once in a while, you know? Since I go here so much. But I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for some good boba drinks.

Only place to get good boba tea in the valley. Don't waste your time and money anywhere else!   I just love how they offer so much variety here. Anything you want, they basically have it and it does not cost an arm or a leg either. Prices are very reasonable. And the staff is amazing! Everyone is always so friendly and welcoming which makes it that much more AWESOME !! (:   And if you're hungry, they got that covered too. I love their popcorn chicken, fried tofu, and fries. Medium spice for that extra oomph and the sauce it comes with is delicious.   Definitely will come back again and again and again!

The only CPK I've been to is at this location. I went here at least 3 times already and all 3 was different experiences. The wait is never long, except one time we 'made' a reservation for 8 even though they don't take reservation, they wrote us down and made sure we got a table quicker when we came back [:  The food is is always delicious. I know people love their pizzas, but I always get the salad too. The roasted vegetable salad is amazing [: We always come in big groups so each of us we get a different pizza to share. So far none have disappointed us. I mean how can you go wrong. Just pick whatever pizza you are craving for and expect it to come out delicious.  The only thing I would not recommend is the pasta, and I guess its our fault cause why go to a pizza place and order pasta.

Atmosphere was amazing! This place have really nice decor, great place to relax and enjoy their food.   Came here on a date long time ago and just thought it was an overpriced sushi joint but I just recently went here with family and had a whole new experience.  Venture outside the sushi even though the sushi are very good! After tasting sushi from multiple restaurant, I gotta say the price of the sushi here is worth it :) 1 or 2 roll will get you full.   Other foods here are good too. Love their garlic edamame and seaweed salad. The sesame chicken is different but in a good way [: The yakisoba was okay and the seafood udon was unexpected cause you want an asian flavour but get a cajun instead. The soupy noodles were better though. Love the cha sui ramen and the spicy udon noodles.     Service was excellent! took forever to be seated but it was expected because we came in when the waiters were switching shifts but they didnt hover and came back periodically to make sure we got everything we need. We definitely will be back soon to try out other foods on their menu.

I was first introduce to this place almost over 5 years ago and it started out great but I think I might have to break up with Teharu.   I'm more interested in the food so I'll start with that. I always get my usual when I go here and it's always Hawaiian, Vegas, Dragon, and Bake scallop. Now I live in East Mesa so it is a good 30 minutes drive to get here and let me tell you, it used to be worth it. The last 5 times I've been here has been a miss. Vegas roll was always cold, kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a deep fried roll? No? The Hawaiian roll, which is spicy tuna roll with tuna on top and spicy mayo is always unbearably spicy because I think they are trying to mask away fishy flavour since their fish isn't the greatest of quality, which I knew for the price wasn't going to be the greatest already so when it's extremely spicy, then i can't eat it so...?  Now what annoys me is the bake scallop because that was my absolute favorite but lately it's always been disgusting. Like it has a pee smell on the scallop so when you eat it, you feel like your eating someone's piss.   I never get to try new rolls anymore because the ones on the belt most of the time looks dried and like it's been there since they opened up for the day. And there's usually 1 left, what's so hard about replenishing it? Or do they wait for that one customer who just eats anything to eat it before they put out more? That's another thing that erks me, if you're a conveyer belt sushi, shouldn't you have someone dedicated to constantly stock the belt with a variety of sushi so that customers can grab? Lately it seems that they focus on orders more and then the belt becomes empty and sad.  When can the price of something stop being accountable for the quality you get? Yeah it's cheap but when can we stop saying, oh for the price it's not bad. And this is why restaurants continue to lack and not improve.   Oh and for the waiters and waitresses there, I'm not even going to waste my time writing about them because the don't bother wasting their time serving me.   So long story short. Try it for the experience but don't expect much cause you know, for the price and all.... ( last part was sarcasm if you didn't catch it )

My first time eating Thai food and La's Thai Cuisine and it did not disappoint!   Thai food has always been on my list but I never was intrigued enough to go out and try it until now. I'm glad I did because its absolutely delicious! We went during lunchtime on a weekday afternoon and the place was packed! After eating, I can see why. The portions are huge and cheap. What more can you ask for?  We were given an ordinary salad (ice burg, carrots, and tomatoes)  with a very sweet tasting vinaigrette. Didn't really enjoy it because it was too sweet for my liking but it was free so I shouldn't be complaining [: It took us a long time to order because I am a very indecisive person and everything sounded so good. They had Chinese type dish on their menu which I try not to want because I want to try Thai.   We end up ordering a peanut curry with chicken and pad thai with tofu. The peanut curry came with rice and the pad thai came with a mix of lettuce and cabbage. Both came with a vegetable eggroll. We asked for medium spicy which was a little bit too spicy for me because I can't tolerate it too much but medium was enough spicy for my friend. Next time, I would definitely go mild.   How it work is you pick your dish then they ask you to pick your protein. I think its between beef, seafood, chicken, tofu, or vegetable. Then you pick your spice level.   Oh and we ended up ordering mango sticky rice for dessert. Sweet sticky rice topped with coconut milk and a side of mango. It was delicious! My friend said it tasted like the one he had in Thailand and when we spoke to the owner, he said he makes the sweet sticky rice fresh everyday [: (I liked the black sweet rice more and my friend likes the white one but whichever one you order should be fine cause they are delicious!)  Overall we enjoy the food very much. I can't wait to try other Thai dishes from here. Only downfall is I live so far away but I found out the owner lives near me out in East Mesa. Poor guy. Commuting must be a pain. I would definitely recommend this place. Now I think I'm brave enough to try other Thai places.  Thanks La's Thai Cuisine for giving me such a good first experience!

I didn't like this place so much, maybe because I'm Vietnamese? But their food is nothing special really. Very common for a Vietnamese restaurant but their specialty is their rice plates so I would hope it was delicious.  I love my food to come out hot if it is suppose to be hot or at least warm maybe but when I order their special rice plate, the meats came out cold and the rice was a little warm. Didn't even bother asking them to reheat it because the staff there seems no where to be found. I do like that the plates do come with a bowl of hot soup which do come out hot [:  I don't know. If you don't have a Vietnamese mom who knows how to cook rice plates then I would recommend going here but I do have a mother who can do better so I definitely will not be returning.

My aunt was excited to take us here for her birthday. Yup, take us out for HER birthday. She said she want us to try this place because it has authentic British food and if we don't like it, we can go somewhere else... ??? She said theres two location and she always go to the one in Tempe but she yelped and saw that the Mesa location isn't as packed as the one in Tempe.   Upon arrival, I realized I've eaten here once before. Nothing too crazy but not bad either [: I just remembered that their fries are called 'chips' instead.   We were lucky and got seated right away for a party of 8. Of course we ordered the chips, some with garlic and some without and each of us got a different pasty to try. There was just so much options I couldnt pick from, so I asked the waitress which ones were her favorite and I settled for the Salmon one. Eh..  Chips with and without garlic were a bit on the salty side.  Salmon pasty- a bit too fishy  Italian pasty - my favorite! If I would have ordered this, maybe I would like this place more.  Cajun chicken - my second favorite, even got one to go for my mom ;]  Chicken alfredo - I felt like the chicken were a bit on the dry side.  Hamburger pasty - Makes great leftover! Microwaved and eaten with A1 steak sauce !  I don't remember the names of the other ones but my sister got a mexicanish flavor and I didnt even bother to try because I dont really like that flavour.   BUT the thing that made our night was the dessert!!! If you come here, make sure you leave room for some dessert pasty!  Of course we were all full but my aunt gave glowing reviews about the dessert and we decided to try out some. Unfortunately because of the monsoon season in Arizona right now which makes it more humid (is that possible???), there were no strawberry meringes, so we stuck with the apple pasty and the PBJ with banana pasty.  Oh my, the apple was my favorite of the two because of the caramel sauce they filled it with. Heaven in your mouth. The PBJ was not bad either. I just wish they put more banana in it because the bites with the banana were the best. They have actual pieces of peanuts in there also which gave it a nice crunch.   All in all, I dont mind eating here again.

I have no idea why I have never tried this place until now.   Seriously AMAZING!!!  I got the mango with cream and added ice cream to the bottom and oh my, I am in heaven.   The ice is just so finely shaved that it's so smooth and melts in your mouth. No ice crystals ever! And the ice cream is so smooth too!   Definitely coming back!

This place is awesome [: We went here yesterday because my friends and I have been on an ice cream kick lately and plus my friends live in Laveen and he said this place is really good so we wanted to try.  The staffs are very friendly, they keep offering us samples which is nice cause they have a lot of flavours. They even had a ham flavour but I didn't try because erms... well yeah. Pricing isn't too expensive imo.  Oh and their cones are awesome! I like how its thin and crunchy so it doesnt have the stale-ness taste when you eat. It reminds me of Abbott's Frozen Custard, a place back where I grew up so that was awesome [:   Definitely recommend this place!

I love it here! I only have gone here a couple of times for the buffet but I think thats the smart way to go!  I had my first Indian food experience here so I have nothing to really compare to. I did have the buffet during lunch and dinner and there are only minor differences but the food is always delicious! I love how they bring hot garlic naan out to your table and refill it once its gone.   I love trying new food and the buffet help me do just that. I get to taste a little bit of everything without having to waste food or burn a hole in my wallet. Now I know what I like [: The bf at the time loves their chicken tikka masala, which I agree is absolutely amazing! But I also love their yogurt sauce and the mint chutney. I seem to want to put those 2 sauces all over everything I eat. Oh and I love the basmati rice! Its so different from all the rice I ever tried before but in a good way!  The staff is real friendly and always refill your drinks and make sure you have everything you need all the time.   If you want Indian food, you should definitely come here! Amazing delicious food and friendly service. Win win!

Well after being out of the country for quite some time, my sister and I wanted some real Italian food. But... this is Arizona... does it even exist if we don't cook it ourselves?   We were desperate and Olive Garden is just meh to us. We only enjoy their free bread and salad so that was out of the question. After quite some time, we decided on Old Spaghetti Factory... I took her here once for her birthday and the food was decent so we decided to give it another go.  This time around, it wasn't all that great. The waitress seems to be all over the place. I had to ask twice for the water to be refilled. When we order she also ask us "lunch or dinner" portions but completely left out what the difference was.   Anyways to the food.  We were all hungry so the appetizer was quickly devoured. The sausage and cheesy garlic bread was pretty good, my brother seems to enjoy it a lot but the olive tapenade was just okay, nothing special.  Oh and on another note the free bread should have been brought out with the appetizers, no? It was brought out with our food...  So yeah, the food came out and it wasn't all that good. The marinara sauce was a little on the sour side. And it seems like all their dishes use that one sauce. Needless to say, very dissapointing. All 5 dishes... from lasagna to chicken parmesan to silicon meatballs .... all taste the same...  I don't think I will be returning.

I'm hesitant to even give this place 2 stars but eh. I live so close to Yogurt Kingdom but never thought of giving them a try until yesterday since I've been on a yogurt kick lately. Of all the ones I tried recently (Yoppi in Tempe, Blue Ocean in Chandler Mall, Yogurtology in Scottsdale Mall, Yougrtland in Scottsdale and then revisited iTwist @ Mekong Plaza) this has got to be the worst.   The owner (or so I think) seems not to happy to give out samples but I dont want to go get a cup full of yogurt that ends up tasting not so great. (I ended up doing just that...) So after trying the original (of course since I always go for that flavour) and my sister trying cake batter, thats what we end up getting. I also asked the owner how was the reese's peanut butter was and he replied people seem to like it better then regular peanut butter but it cost more for them to have the flavour, it should of kicked in to not get it since he didn't say it taste good, but I ended up getting it also and boy was it a mistake. It did NOT taste anything like peanut butter let alone reese's. I should of stick to what I usually get at frozen yogurt shops and stay with the tarts.  The yogurts was nothing to brag about. They were a little bit on the watery side? So don't expect creamy deliciousness from here.  The topping bar was massive but messy. Makes it look unappetizing. They should have tongs for the mochi since they put it on top and when I went to scoop, it felt like the glass jar was going to fall over.   I would probably return out of desperation since I live in East Mesa and this is the only one I know thats close to me but I am probably not that desperate. I'll give it one more try sometime before crossing them off my list forever.

I had a lot of hit and misses at this location but since it was the one closest to my house, I go here every so often ( not as often since the one time they gave me raw chicken )  The stars are base on the raw chicken and the service because let's face it, this is a chain restaurant so basically it should taste the same everywhere just different people making it and different attitudes.   My sister and I love Chipotle and and we went through our phase of wanting/eating it everyday. One hot afternoon we came in to get our usual the chicken bowl and when we went to eat it, the chicken just feels off. Then I looked down and to my surprise the chicken still had blood on it. We contemplated on telling someone because we don't really like complaining about our food. But we ended up doing it and the response we got was off.   The guy who looked like a manager or something said that he will replace this 'on the house' and that our meal 'will be free' which makes no sense because we already paid for them ???  Then the girl who was working was really defensive and went to tell us she don't think it was raw and that she took the temperature and everything. She didn't get to look at the bowls before he threw them away in the trash but is she trying to imply that we were lying? He obviously saw and apologize so what's her deal? Anyways after we got our new replacement bowls, we barely ate it because the thought of raw chicken just freaks me out and ruined my appetite.   It's been a few months since the incident and I would not go back to this location if I had a choice but it's extremely close to my house.   That last few times I've been here, the employees do skimp on ingredients and when you ask for more, I feel like I get attitude. Even when theres no line, I feel rushed. I like extra pico and lettuce ... What can I say but they just dump it on and push you forward. Like it's a sin to ask for more lettuce.   Anyways I still love chipotle just not this location.

The mother wanted some vietnamese food,  specifically this sweet and sour soup and clay pot fish ( canh chua and ca kho ) so we gave this place a try and was a huge disappointment.   When I first walked in, the smell of the place already threw me off. Even at a bad vietnamese restaurant, you get the delicious pho smell but not here, no delicious smell to match the not so delicious food.   Anyways we also ordered eggrolls and it only came as 2 in an order and the fresh vegetables that came with it wasn't so fresh. The dipping sauce was on the salty side so was the soup that we ordered so I'm guessing it's a theme. We barely ate the clay pot fish since there was nothing special about it.   In the end, definitely not worth the 35 dollars spent there.

My pho came out warm and if you're a true Vietnamese you know we need that soup piping hot. I almost asked for them to microwave my bowl... Needless to say I was disappointed.   I don't know why there was miscommunication but when we where given our pho, we did not get any fresh veggies or sauce. I had to ask our server for it and he seemed annoyed ... Which made me confused because shouldn't a pho restaurant automatically have the sauces at the table? And why did I have to ask for my veggies? And why was he annoyed when he clearly fail to do his job?   I guess I would never find out the answers because definitely will never return

Oh my, where should I start?  I was extremely ecstatic when I saw a Thai restaurant opened up in East Mesa and even more excited when they serve extremely delicious food.  I've eaten here plenty of times and each time was suburb!!! One night our party of 10 came in for my sister's birthday dinner after we were told the wait for another restaurant was at least an hour, and Thai kitchen staff gave us no fuss at all. They rearrange to accommodate our large party and serve us with smiling faces. After I checked in on Yelp, I realize they close in half an hour which made me appreciate them even more.   My favorite is the chicken pad thai (medium spice) and beef green curry (medium spice). I eat pretty spicy and I felt like medium was perfect for me.   Pros: + prices are VERY reasonable, especially for lunch + wait staff is always friendly and accommodating  + decor is cute with elephant pillows at the booths + mango sticky rice, need I say more?   Cons: - they close between lunch and dinner   I definitely would come back, only place I want my Thai food.
