Went here today for my first time ever with my boyfriend....As a native Texan I can't believe I have never been here before. It was like stepping into an East Texas hometown, neighborhood restaurant. The decor had city limit signs, neons, pictures of Willie Nelson and Ronald Reagan. The delightfully tacky interior made me feel like I was home again.   Well, obviously like every other person that has written a Yelp review on TEXAZ Grill, we ordered the Chicken Fried Steak for our entrees. They first brought out rolls and biscuits. I like that the table has honey, hot sauce, and every other necessary condiment so you don't have to wait to have the server bring it over. We received a small plate of salad. Just enough to satiate the appetite's requirement for lettuce greens and ranch dressing.   My eyeballs literally popped out of socket when the server brought over our C.F.S. Oh Lawns, the portion was ENORMOUS!!! Like I told the server, everything really is bigger in Texas. The tender cubed steak was battered perfectly and smothered in a nice country gravy. Nonetheless, I decided to douse it in Cholula Sauce to give it a nice little kick. The mashed potatoes were definitely made Southern Style by mixing in the skins. By the time my tummy was ready to explode, I still had a full plate enough to share with two people. I am super surprised how large the portion is compared to the price point. Overall, a great deal and delicious meal. But eat here too often, and you will be contributing to the obesity epidemic in America.

We frequent Manuel's a couple of times a month. I think it warrants 3.5 stars but since we go often I'm going to bump it up rather than down.  I prefer sitting at the bar or "Cantina" area of Manuel's.  The couple of times we sat in the dining room the service was not really up to par.  Each time in the dining room, our server went missing and our food took a very long time.  Bad luck maybe...   The food is usually pretty good and I am very critical of my mexican food!  My BF and I often share the fajitas for two.  We get a chicken/steak combo and request our veggies grilled with EVOO for a heart healthier version.  It's a ton of food and we each get our own side of beans, guac, sour, etc... I always have leftovers.    A few times when I've felt indulgent, I've also enjoyed the Tres Amigos Enchiladas.  YUM! It's a enchilada trio (carne asada meat, chicken, spinach or cheese).  It's delicious.  I'm not really a fan of the Chicken Taco Salad.  I've only had it once and that was when I popped in for a quick lunch.  First, they serve the taco shell bowl on a very small plate so you can break the shell and mix up your salad.  That annoyed me and I had to request a larger plate.  On this visit, the chicken was dry and the guac was slightly brown.  It just didn't look appetizing at all.  I left hungry and $10 poorer.           The salsa is also very fresh and flavorful.  They serve a "medium" and "hot" version.  I like to combine the two for a custom salsa.

I went last night for dinner but I've been coming to this place for years due to its convenient location.  I have to be honest, I think the menu had radically improved!  I love their chips and salsa and if you love spicy you can ask for a hotter version.  We shared the Ultimate Chimichanga and it was bomb-delicious! They split our plates and I could only eat 1/2 of it! Great value especially when sharing!! I'm craving leftovers already! Going back very soon!

OMG I love Costco! I would give 5 stars but I wouldn't say this is the BEST Costco.  The one is Scottsdale is PRIMO.  They have super duper premium wines, liquors, jewelry, etc...  But my Cave Creek location is HOME!  Great customer service all of the time.  I go there just to walk around and eat samples sometimes! :)

I am a big fan of Half Moon in North Phoenix.  The food is amazingly good for a sports bar!  My favorite is the Greek Salad!  They also do special menus on holidays -- this past year we did a low-key Valentines date and were pleasantly surprised they offered a "coursed" dinner.   Also, the wait staff is dressed super cute without it being a "breastaurant".  It's kid friendly in the dining area.

I love my local neighborhood sports restaurant/bar! I go several times a week. The day time bartenders are the BEST(shout out to John, Misty, and Andi)! The food is good with great prices and they have an "all day" happy hour - ends at 7 I think. Go on Mondays for $5 any burger special. It's our weekly family dinner night!

I love this movie theater!  It is clean and comfortable!  But the BEST thing EVER --- they have a child care!!!  Grown ups can drop their kid's into the child care for $6 per kid while they go and watch a grown-up movie.  Now, if they just served wine I would be a very happy momma!

Damn, I know why Best Buy is closing stores left and right! Their return and warranty policy sucks! I just bought a laptop from them a month ago. The screen started getting squiggly lines. I took it back and they said since I didn't purchase the manufacturers warranty and it was 15 days after my purchase they wouldn't exchange. Best Buy sucks. I'm sticking with Costco from now on into forever!

I frequent the Desert Ridge location often.  I usually sit at the bar when I'm alone and always have very prompt and friendly service.    Anyone that is familiar with PJ knows they have the BEST hummus in town.  I love to get the trio of regular, roasted red pepper, and cilantro jalapeno.  And for an entree, top it off with a protein such as the ahi tuna, chicken, or steak.  My BF and I will often split the Chicken Curry Salad, a side order of Tahini Cauliflower, and the Mixed Beans AND we STILL have left overs.  My new recent favorite is the Veggie Lavosh Wrap.  OMG, even if you aren't a Veg Head this is sooo yummy and a HUGE portion!  Also, if you are on a budget... House Wines (Red & White) & Margaritas are super cheap!

Well, it is a McDonald's attached to a gas station so what can you expect.    First thing that irritated me with this place... the drive thru.  Sometimes, it is inconveniently closed during peak morning hours.  Why? I don't know.  I'm assuming they are understaffed.  Second, the bathroom is disgusting and unisex.  I won't let my poor daughter use it even if she is about to pop.

WOW!!!! I found this place by using my YELP mobile app searching for nearby places to eat next to my home.  I had NO idea this hidden gem was literally a few miles up the road from me across from Deer Valley Airport.   It turns out this place has almost a 5 star yelp rating, was featured on Guy Fieri's Diner's, Drive-In, & Dives (love me some Triple D!), AND has a $20 for $10 GROUPON!!!   So, my date and I decided to check it out for the first time this past Friday night.  I could smell the bbq before we even pulled in the parking lot.  I had a HUGE smile on my face walking in the doors! The menu is on a flat screen tv in front of the register.  You place your order there rather than sitting at a table and ordering from a server.    We both got the MONSTER which is a sandwich with Beef Brisket and Pork, jalapenos, slaw, pepper jack cheese (I think I got that right).  You pick 2 sides and I chose the mac n cheese and the baked beans.  OMG I am so in love with this food right now! The bbq was simply delicious, the mac n cheese was phenom, and those were the BEST baked beans I have ever eaten in my life.... and I'm a Southern Girl!   I will be back many times... probably later today.  I can't wait to eat my way through the menu.  Thank you YELP!!!!

The atmosphere is great for watching a game or grabbing a drink before a movie at the theatre next door; however, the food is mediocre at best.   My first time visit I had the salmon salad. It was bland and boring. Not worth $14 for sure!   Second visit, I ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup. Upon it's arrival it was obvious it had been sitting in a Cambro in the walk-in for a couple days. Seriously, it came out cold and congealed.  I put my spoon in the bowl and bounced it on top of the soup jello. Giving benefit of the doubt, I had them refire it. It came out scalding Hot and I burnt my tongue (did they do that on purpose?). The flavor was ok but I kept thinking why am I bothering to eat this slop?!   Bottom line, the food is frozen and made in bulk. It's expensive for the quality but you are paying for location and convenience.

Tully's Coffee is the BEST!  A very comfortable neighborhood spot to grab a cup of coffee and fresh pastry.  An incredibly warm and friendly staff!

SO happy to have a new sports bar/restaurant in the Desert Ridge area.  I have been twice since they opened and have to say the remodel (formerly "The Office") is fantastic!    My first visit I was served by Kim at the bar and she was very friendly and professional.  High Five on customer service.  I ordered the filet which was priced exceptionally well.  However, it took 4EVER coming out of the kitchen so I just packed it to go.  They also forgot to put my side salad in the bag.  I understand for a busy opening week there are lots of kinks to work out.      Second visit, I tried there chicken fried steak.  OMG.  It was so delish.  Even had a little bit of peppery spice to it.  The portion is enormous so be prepared to share, get a doggie bag, or have an incredibly bloated tummy,  Overall, very happy so far!  I will surely be a regular.

I am an F&B industry person and it literally hurts my heart to give a 2 star; however, I am rating based on my experience and HOPE that management takes that into account to improve quality and service. And honestly, I would rate 1 star on food but the service made up for the bad experience.   Celebrating mother's day weekend, I was looking for a casual place to have lunch and enjoy some shopping.  I have my favorite dining spots but wanted to try something different.  West Addison at DC Ranch seemed like a good decision but was unfortunately wrong.    My BF and I sat at the bar since it was literally empty.  That's cool, I like personalized service! No complaints on that.  I ordered the Tuna Salad and my BF ordered the Napa Salad.  We also ordered the guacamole.  1st of all, the guac was watery and brown.  It is on the menu as "fresh" but I find it hard to believe.  It had ice chips in it and I am pretty sure it came out of a Costco tub or the like.    So for my salad, my "seared" ahi tuna also came out brown and literally frozen.  YUCK! The bartender tells me that they premake and fridge the tuna daily.  Sorry, when it comes to raw I prefer made to order and special guidelines apply.  It was horrible and I sent it back. The Napa salad that my BF ordered was not very significant at all.   The pulled chicken was good and I liked the flavor of the dill ranch but other than that is was just a bed of lettuce.  Biggest waste of $35 dollars I have spent in a long time.  Good for a drinking spot but the kitchen needs a lot of work!

WOW.  I am impressed by the other ratings of this restaurant.  Maybe I just had a bad experience?  The extra star is for the sweet girl that served our table.  She wasn't spectacular but gets brownie points for kindness and effort.      Originally, we were going to dine at Sting Ray (Biltmore Fashion Square) for sushi but I couldn't hold the 45 minute wait.  Seasons 52 was wide open for availability.  We decided on the bar/lounge since there was live entertainment.  Not even five minutes after being seated we decided the environment in the bar was just WEIRD and inevitably added to the bad experience.  The speakers need a serious fix.  My boyfriend described it best as sounding like someone was singing karaoke out of a kazoo.  Not to mention, the song selections were fit for a rehearsal at a hospice facility.   I don't mean to sound snotty, but who the heck did they hire for interior decorating?  This place looked like someone got confused and designed a 1990's three-meal restaurant concept in a Vegas hotel/casino.  The booths were covered in a fabric that reminded me of a Bill Cosby modern ugly sweater and the bar stools were jungle fever zebra or something.  There is an exhibition kitchen in the main dining room which is always a nice touch to the atmosphere.  I think the best part of this restaurant is the view of the wine cellar in the bar.  And by the way, the wine list is claimed to be "award winning" but I was NOT impressed at all.  It is listed by varietal and price rather than being progressive by the taste profile.    So, my fiance and I split a bottle of Gascon Malbec ($34 and sells for $12 at the grocery store) , the small spinach salad, asparagus side dish, and the lamb t-bone chops.  The food was tasty but something I could easily make at home.  The server recommended the lamb EVEN though I expressed I am not a lamb lover.  Well, I am still not a lamb lover.  I took one bite and passed the plate over to the mister.   My only complaint on the service is that she did not ask me if I enjoyed it or wished to order something else.    Anyway, we spent $100 and I left hungry.  Needless to say, I won't be going back unless someone drags me here. And I could only imagine it would be my grandmother if she were still alive.

I am trying to be a better Yelper and my review of Local Bistro is long over due.  This is one of my favorite dining spots in the entire Valley.  In fact, my fiance and I literally fell in love with one another at this place about a year ago.    Typically, we sit at the bar because we like the casual and efficient service.  The bartender will have our bottle of Malbec ready to serve when she sees us coming through the door.  My favorite dishes:   #1 Drunk bread:  Ummm to DIE for delish!  A huge slab of ciabatta bread is soaked in white wine and baked with Gruyère cheese in a hot iron skillet.  It comes out bubbling and creamy.  If I didn't give 2 cents about the circumference of my thighs I would eat it ALL the time!  #2 Tuna Nicoise Salad.  It's healthy, fabulous, and filling.  Great as an entree or splitting as an appetizer.  #3 Chicken Parm: A huge portion of pounded chicken that is lightly battered.  It is big enough to share if your appetite is light or watching your portion size.  When sharing, we order extra arugula and marinara sauce.  Perfecto!  #4 Spanish Risotto:  WOW!  It's a phenomenon! A treasure of seafood surprises await your tastebuds with this risotto.  *TIP from a regular* - if you LOVE spicy then be sure to ask for the hot sauce called Mi Salsa.  I am a hot sauce ho and very critical.  This is one of the BEST I have ever had in my life.    The owner ALWAYS comes by to welcome us.  There are plenty of "good" restaurants but the level of personalized service really keeps me coming back again and again. Local Bistro put a happy face on my heart and tummy.

Second time I have been to this place and I LOVE it!  It's a great, cozy atmosphere with friendly service.   We went for Mother's Day brunch at noon and were seated immediately upon arrival.  It was busy just not over packed with people on a wait.    My only complaint was the mimosa I ordered was more juice than sparkling wine.  So, when I requested a second glass I asked for just a splash of oj and they gladly accomodated.    We started with the cheddar cheese fondue.  It was SO good and I love the pretzel bread, apples, and sausage served with it.  For my entree I ordered the Brown Bag Chicken sandwich.  It was phenom!  I am so happy to find a shredded chicken salad that is NOT drenched in mayo.  I wasn't too crazy about the kale salad, it just tasted like, well, kale.    I will be back many times and look forward to exploring the menu! Oh, be sure to check out Churn next door!

Beyond adorable ice cream and candy shop!  There is a limited number of flavors but with all the different topping you can invent your own!  I love that they have a sorts of fun little trinkets and toys.  A great place to take your kids or satisfy a sweet tooth after having a meal at Windsor next door.

I'm excited for my next trip here to eat dinner!  My BF and I stopped by here for a nightcap after I read a small write up on AZCENTRAL.com.  The décor is awesome!  Very warm, inviting, and laid back!  We sat at the bar and were happy to see a bartender that we knew from a previous establishment.  Choosing from their selection of hand-crafted cocktails, we ordered a Tito's Mojito & French 77.  Both were DELICIOUS but I had a taste of the Motito and had to have my own for round two.    Everybody sitting next to us was scarfing down their food and it smelled wonderful.  I can't wait to become a regular here!

I found a coupon in the Savvy Shopper so decided to check this place out since it is new to the Desert Ridge area.  This used to be a little deli next to Pita Jungle.  I thought they did a really cute job remodeling it and making the most of the small space.  BTW, kudos to the owner for selecting the curved high-back booth which blocks the view of the bathroom doors!  Very smart!  I thought the food was quite scrumptious.  I ordered the crab benedict omelet with breakfast potatoes.  The potatoes were not the best I've had and a little greasy and over-cooked.  My BF ordered the chicken sausage hash and said he really liked it.  I will be back for another visit.  It is nice to have a new breakfast spot in the area and support local businesses.

A friend of mine had raved about it on his FB page so I thought I would stop in for lunch.    The menu looked great and I had a hard time making a decision but opted for the Ham & Brie Sandwich with a side of fruit.  The sandwich was tasty good but I thought they skimped on the brie portion which was the whole reason I ordered it.  I should have said something but wasn't in the mood to hassle with it.  Really like the warm atmosphere and the indoor/outdoor bar design is super cool.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I am looking forward to going back and exploring the menu.
