I was picking up some take out from next door and realized I had a package in my car that needed some delivering and decided to multi task! I got there a bit after six, the lady who was working was obviously closing up but let me drop it off anyways- super nice! Come the next day I realized I was supposed to drop it off at fed ex and not UPS. I went to the fed ex website to try to track it & thankfully it was off for delivery. This UPS store was kind and thoughtful enough to make sure my package was sent with the right people. They totally did not have to do that and it was so sweet of them. I will definitely be going to them for future package/shipping needs. A million plus for customer service.

Food is yummy, depending on my mood it seems over-priced at times.  Decor is awesome, clean nice bathrooms.  Drinks are usually delicious but sometimes inconsistent.  The best time i have had here was later in the evening for an appetizer and drinks at the bar after going to First Friday.

I love coming here for Sunday Funday and having a pitcher of Sangria to share. I've also been here for dinner and have always had great, fresh food. The service has always been kind, and prompt.

Awesome music, super friendly Barista's, delicious treats, yummy satisfying beverages, friendly regulars, and plenty of room (when you consider the picnic tables outside as well - nice weather and sunlight permitting)! The best in-house-made chai and whipped cream i've probably ever had. I also love those lucky evenings when i go in & there is someone baking deliciousness that fills the place up with enticing aromas.  P.S. I'm definitely one of those people who will come to Lux to study or do homework for 3 sometimes 4 hours... for those of you who complain about customers like myself, maybe you should consider that we may spend about $20 a week there and are valuable customers to Lux - just like you are. If my books are over crowding where a chair is and you would like to sit there, please just ask. I'd be happy to make room for others and share space.

After venturing to the new building i sadly have to knock this place down a star. As others have mentioned, there's no menu with pricing in a convenient location. There was what appeared to be a menu on a clear glass wall but it was hard to read and only had a few things on there. Luckily i have my regular orders that i know by heart.   I really miss the intimate feeling of the original building. Although I'm happy they had to expand for a growing clientele a part of me wishes they kept the coffee shop a coffee shop and had the food/bar in the new building.   I've also been here twice since the new building, both on a Sunday afternoon and it was so packed! The first Sunday i was able to find a spot to do work, but today i was unable to and just had to turn out the door after doing a lap around and seeing no seats at a table open. I never had that happen in the previous building... Perhaps when the weather is cooler this will improve.

I was not the one who ate here, i opted to go to Jimmy Johns next door, and according to my brother who did eat here, was the right choice. There were two orders in front of him which were already placed and it took them 10 minutes to then take his order of a Philly Cheese Steak, Onion Rings and a drink. By this time i had gone to Jimmy Johns, got my order, and walked over to CVS to pick something up, and walked back to Corleones to get my brother. We waited a few minutes and then his order finally came. I asked what his total was, almost $16!! They charged extra for Onions and Mushrooms (or peppers, can't remember) $1.49 each! These come standard on Philly cheese steaks and we know this because we lived in Philadelphia for 4 years with many real cheese steaks had that were WAY better and 2/3 the price!! My brother said it tasted good, but not for that price and he would have rather gone to Duck & Decanter, Wineburger (both down the road) or even Postinos just for some Bruschetta. If i were him i would rather just go up the road to the Rokerji's reverse Happy hour starting at 9 and get a glass of wine ($5), and their tip steak + Brei bruschetta bites ($5).

My favorite bar within 3 miles of my house!  Katie makes some awesome special drinks, my favorites included her Holiday coffee she made last winter and over the summer she was making a strawberry lemonade drink that was SO YUM!  The two things that originally got me hooked on this lace was the iced coffee drink & they have Strongbow (i only wish it were on tap!).  I love the jukebox & rest of the staff as well - all very nice and if it's not busy easy to chat up.

The only issue i have with this place is parking when it's busy, but really, that's not even that bad! The coffee is yum, the pastries delicious, and when i need some brain food after studying their hummus plate always hits the spot.

I live in this neighborhood and they gave out coupons for a free 12 oz smoothie or size up for $2 for first time customers. I finally had a hankering for a good smoothie and decided to head over. I got their version of a pina colada smoothie with protein and sized up. Typically i get the same kind of thing at Jamba Juice. I wouldn't say it was any better or worse, pretty much the same, which is pretty darn good! It filled me up, and satisfied my smoothie craving. The girls who were working in there were all friendly, and helpful. The only reason i wouldn't give it another star is because i don't know about their regular pricing and how it compares to other smoothie places.

I love trying their specials, it's always pretty delicious! I also love that they have Strongbow, and Rogue Hazelnut brown, so yum! Service is always kind, and 95% of the time prompt. They do get busy though so very understandable. Having a group of 3+ is kind of hard here but great for 1 on 1 or if you can snag the back table bigger groups.

I love coming here on weeknights or early evenings on the weekends when it isn't too crowded. I also find that the nights there is live music it can get overwhelming but depending on who is playing, can make or break it.

I've been here twice for dates and had a great meal, with great service each time, along with great company. The first time here i had the green chile pork, it was a bit spicy, very flavorful and the pork was tender. The cornbrread along side was great too. it was also he perfect portion size. The second time i had a burger and it was SO delicious. I usually would order something that i can't make myself but im glad i ordered it! The ketchup which is made in house (i think) alongside was also really good and had a slight kick to it.

Yucca is a staple in my routine of dive-ish bars, and always entertaining for sure! Depending on the night the clientele can range from regulars, hip-hop heads, to metal heads and everything in between.  Callan is one of two of my favorite bartenders there. Always so sweet, with a huge smile on her face and takes the time to make sure you get exactly what you want. My other favorite being Jared, what can i say, he makes a stiff drink and has more charm and charisma than the hoff.

Came here on a Monday and unfortunately wasn't hungry enough for a burger but had the buffalo chicken dip and asparagus bruschetta, both super delicious!! We also had the Sangria which was just a touch sweet, perfecto! Our service was great too, always checked in on us but not too often, she also let us linger, & enjoy our time there on a busy night which i always really appreciate.

I went here with a friend for some food to go and had a good experience.  I got the pork torta and my friend got 3 tacos, one chicken, one fish, and one steak. My torta was okay, the pork seemed extremely salty though, i wouldn't order it again. My friend who got the tacos was more than pleased and stoked that they were baja style. He only ate 2 and i ate the steak one the next day which was still super delicious!

The staff has always been super awesome to me, which i really appreciate, especially on those early mornings when i know it's just going to be a long day. When it comes to getting a straight up cup-o-joe it's delicious and hits the spot. Sometimes i get a crazy hair up my butt and order one of those silly sugary drinks, and when ever i do i wish i had just gotten a regular coffee. I don't know what it is about the "specialty" drinks here that i don't like. Which is weird because other coffee places (local and chain) i usually don't have that reaction.

I came here for Happy Hour on a Wednesday after a long day to watch a Suns game with a friend and had a nice relaxing time. I love that they have Kona beers, especially because not many places have the Koko brown on tap which is just too delicious to not try if you're a fan of coconut and beer. I also had an order of Tofu tacos that were perfect for a light meal and not lacking on taste. I'll definitely be back since it's in the neighborhood!

Service was slow. Ordered a nonfat chai latte with shot of espresso, not too complicated. The chai was bitter due to the herbs not being strained out which also made it gritty- a very unpleasant texture in a drink. The only pluses about this place is the decor & patio. Didn't try any food but it looked good.

Pretty yum! Some friends and i decided to bike here last Saturday afternoon and this was one of the places we ventured! I only had the drunken geisha during happy hour and it was delicious! Others grabbed some food and i didn't hear any complaints. Our server was awesome and even put our last round of drinks on "hold" for Happy hour pricing, which was extremely kind of her! Nice patio, and great happy hour prices.  P.S. i would not come here during regular pricing hours.

I've been here twice now for Happy Hour and both times left feeling very unimpressed. The first time we were there was for Happy hour since we were told that it was $2 wells and half off of some food. Score! right?!...  kind of. I had ordered a blood orange vodka premium drink that was $4 and okay tasting, while my friends got wells. Our waitress appeared to be out of it, rarely checked on us and over charged us on our bill ($4 for wells and premiums? that just doesn't make sense) and when we questioned it, she said she was not sure and asked her manager. The manager i guess had squared away the bill, we paid and went on our way. My friends who bill was wrong ended up having the original pricing charged to her card.  Why we decided to return baffled me but friends were there so we met up again. I think it was the allure of $2 wells and us thinking that maybe by then they had their servers better educated for happy hour service. Plus i was hungry,...Wrong! Our server this time was better, but again when it came to the bill had charged us $4 for wells, and had to talk to the manager, again, who thankfully took care of us.   Now for the food. I ordered the pork tacos with mango salsa. The tortillas were delicious but i had wished there was a bit more pork on there and more salsa, it just wasn't very much. but for $3 i wasn't really complaining either! I'd probably get it again and ask for more of the mango salsa on the side.

I have been here 2 times in the past week. It is that yummy! The first time i had the pak lok beef - it was very good, the beef was a bit tough but the flavors were amazing. My dinner companion was hoping there would be some adult beverages, but they do not sell alcohol yet. However it is BYOB with a corking fee. The second time i went with my Mom since she is a huge fan of different cuisines from around the world. We shared a cambodian coffee (yuuum and strong!) the crepes and ginger chicken stir fry. The crepes were both our favorite dish, i would still recommend the stir fried chicken though too! Both were delicious. Just a heads up though the chicken used was mostly dark meat, i love this cut of chicken but my mom prefers breast meat (she still thought it was yummy though). All of the meals i had there tasted so clean and fresh, a steal for the prices they have. Both times the servers were super friendly and nice. The time between the two shared dishes was perfect. The ambiance is very pleasant. I'll definitely be becoming a regular at this place.

There are some days where you just want a delicious little treat for yourself. When I'm having one of those days I love to come here for a honeydew smoothie or an iced coffee with a glazed or buttermilk doughnut (My absolute favorite). There is no reason to go to a chain like DD or KK for delicious doughnutty goodness when these guys do it better!! I've also had one of their apple fritters that was super delicious too! I have only gone through the drive through but have only had excellent service.

Went last night when we realized Rice Paper was closed for repairs. The service was prompt and fairly friendly. We got the pear and prosciutto (I think it was supposed to come with arugula but it had spinach on it - can't quite remember) and the potato with garlic. Both were okay, nothing special or memorable. The proscuitto was suuuper salty and needed more sweetness to cut it. & the potato pies leaks were tough, also it just needed a little something more, not sure what. We both agreed we had better pizzas at other places in Phoenix that had similar flavor profiles & would prefer to go there instead of here in the future.

I am so grateful this place has opened! I went to see Phantogram here a couple of weeks ago and had such a great time. As someone who often ventures to shows on her own, i felt safe here (walking in, and walking out), everyone i talked to was friendly, I even ran into some old friends and I always received prompt service both in the lounge and stage area. I loved the use of the "bleachers" to add seating you can see from. & the sound! Such a great sound system. I cannot wait to see more shows here!

Went here the other night with some girl friends after having some dranks. The fry bread was so salty. Both the sweet and savory. I thought I was getting a "Navajo taco" with green chilis and what I got was a gross burger patty with fry bread as a bun. When I've gone to kayenta, or other towns on reservations, when I would get a Navajo taco it was fry bread with delicious chili, cheese, lettuce tomato onion and Greene chili. This was just grooss. Bring back the nachos.

I went here last night with friends to try something new, and we were happy with the decision to venture out! The decor and atmosphere is nice with out feeling too stuffy. Lots of TV's to watch games on, and a beautiful chandelier above the bar area. The staff was good as well as their drinks!   As for food, I had the turkey club sandwich with sweet potato fries. I enjoyed the rosemary mayo they used & the turkey on it was yum, but it was over priced (hence 4 stars), it was like an $8 sandwich, not $12. The bread choice for the sandwich kind of put a damper on it too (standard white sandwich bread). If they used a croissant or a good sourdough then maybe worth the $12. The portion for the fries with the sandwich was a bit stingy too. One of my pet peeves is charging extra for healthy side options, and they had a $2 add on for a side salad instead of fries.   My friend got the mozzarella "nuggets", she said they were okay but she probably wouldn't order them again. I also got a Moscow mule with bourbon instead of vodka, it was delicious & priced appropriately! If I go again it'd be just for drinks and not food, unless they bring down their prices. Also their kitchen closed around 10, which is understandable since there was not a lot of people there, but may want to consider staying open later as patrons roll in.

I've been here twice for Happy Hour, once mid week and one time on a late Sunday night. Both times i sat at the bar area and service was always courteous and timely. Both times i had the georgia peach whiskey "martinis" - so delicious. And for food i have tried the Spring rolls, fried tofu with dipping sauces, and Soup Goyza - all delicious, and fresh as well. I definitely would like to come back to try some of their entrees. Some friends got their soups as well which looked super delicious.
