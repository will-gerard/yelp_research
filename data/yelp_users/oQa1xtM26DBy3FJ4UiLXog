First off, I love love love this place!!   Everything I do is physically taxing... I run, teach dance, coach and I'm always moving! My body unfortunately does not recover fast enough as I'm driving from one place to the next  luckily this place is here to help my muscles get ready for the next challenge!   Trish and Brynn are amazing and know exactly what I need... They are there to make sure I'm getting what is best for my lifestyle and I am so thankful!

I made my reservations here on yelp and it was so easy!! My fianc√© was so surprised for his birthday since he never heard me making his birthday plans!!  We were walked to a special area and had the most incredible meal!! We are still talking about it days later...   We were taken care of at every turn and given incredible suggestions that made our night complete! Everyone from our waiter to the hostess were awesome! (Our waiter was even wearing a breast cancer awareness ribbon tie, I thought that was a great touch on his part)   We had a wonderful time and ate incredible food... If your looking for a place for a nice evening or to celebrate anything, this is the place!

Talk about an owner that loves his business! He noticed my girlfriend and were confused and gave us incredible recommendations! The first words out of Sydney's mouth were "this is actually AMAZING" mine was a tad spicy, but I didn't stop eating till it was gone! I eat local and shop local and this place is for sure a new spot for me!! Andrea at the register, when I got the complimentary chips for checking in was so sweet and just gave me chips with a smile  I'll be back for sure and I'll be spreading the word!

I'll never ever ever ever be back...    Great friends and awesome drinks... Until the bartender in an empty bar decided to tell to the whole place he won't separate tabs... (Wanted to make sure my girlfriend whose birthday it was wouldn't pay...) chased me down to continue his yelling as I walked away!   Brought the wrong drink, took forever with food and is actually currently talking about how horrible I am behind the bar as I write this!   Don't worry, I won't return

It's scary trying a new place and a new person for something as personal and visible as your brows or your face!!! Well let me calm your nerves, I love how she does my eyebrows and how she has handled my difficult skin!!  Calming room, and quick and painless waxing... Mel knows her stuff and I'm really lucky to have found her!
