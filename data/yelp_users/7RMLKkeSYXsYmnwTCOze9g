I must fill you in on a Little back story before I tell you about my experience with Fletcher's Tire and Auto...  A month or so ago, I had to get a mobile locksmith to come to me because my car wasn't starting with the key I had. While the mobile locksmith was making the key, I had an emergency call and had to leave right away. He didn't finish the key, but I put the key he was in the process of making in my car...forgetting all about it.  Forward to today... I dropped my car off at Fletchers because something was going on with it and smoke was coming out of my engine. They called me the next day to tell me that it was gonna cost me $550.00. Thinking that we should get a second opinion, the hubby and I went down to pick up the car. When we pulled up, we noticed that the car was in the same exact parking spot that we had left it in when we dropped it off, but didnt really think too much of it at that time. We told them that we were gonna take our car and get a second opinion... they gave us our key back and we were on our way. We tried starting our car with the key we left for them and it wouldn't start. We used the master key and it started right up. ( I had given them the key that the locksmith made for me, not knowing it wouldn't start my car. )  When we got home, I called Fletcher's back and asked them if they had any problems starting my car up ( damn well knowing they couldn't start my car! ) and his response was..." nope, it started right up. Didn't have a problem with it at all." how could that be when the key we had given them didn't start my car at all?!!!  Knowing that they were dishonest, we knew we weren't taking the car back there for the repairs it needed. Long story short, We ended up having it fixed for $108.00 AND FLETCHER'S WASN'T EVEN CORRECT WITH THEIR DIAGNOSIS!!!!!! It turned out it was something totally different AND WAY CHEAPER!!!!! What they said was wrong with my car wasn't what it was AT ALL!!!!!  I will NEVER take my car back there again. I need to trust the people that work on my car!

Absolutely our fave place to go for Mexican food. Out of all the mexican restaurants we have eaten at, their salsa is THE BEST (love the hot and the mild). We have eaten there 30+ times and have only had bad service a few times. Cant go wrong here!

Yard House is the place that my fam goes 90% of the time when we go out to eat... My hubby and I love love love the Classic Cheeseburger! Hands down, no joke, the BEST hamburger either of us has ever had! Their appetizers are delish! We love the nachos (minus beans) but be careful not to ruin your dinner cuz they are humongo. They have a wide variety of foods, all delicious! We have never had bad service here either. Mmm,mmm,mmm good!

This is great chinese food. The meat is not "mystery meat" and it is good clean food. I love the Mongolian Beef or they can substitute beef for chicken. Kinda on the pricey side, but good.

This place is super yummy. It kinda looks like a dive from the front, but it is really good. Their breakfast is so dang good... if you are going for dinner, I would recommend the Linguine Princepessa. It is fabuloso! Their bread is amazing, but the service... its either hit or miss. Seems to be a fave place for the locals!

YUCK!  No joke, the worst bbq my family and I have had.  We went once, didn't even eat,  left and went to another place. So disappointing!

Had such a great meal here! We were having a serious craving for king crab legs and I decided to surprise him and take him here for dinner. From the drinks to dessert- the food was absolutely amazing. Best crab legs I've had and the best crab legs he's had in Arizona. Had Creme brûlée for dessert! Totes amazing!! We will definitely be coming back here very soon!

Holy hell! Just had the best massage of my life today with Eric! I was extremely relaxed and comfortable as he worked his magic on my aching body. He has super prices- he's in an extremely convenient location- he can come to you- and he does an absolutely amazing job! I've already booked my next appointment!!

This place is close to our house and we love the food...BUT the service, the 6 out of 7 times we have eaten here, is beyond frusterating! I only give it 2 stars because of the POOR service. Maybe they just need to work out the kinks...but, when? Great food but go when you have all the time in the world! The service will KILL YOU!  If you go to this location, ask for Colleen. She was wonderful.

I am absolutely in love with Lily and her lashes!  She does an amazing job!  I have received SO MANY compliments on my eyes and my lashes!  I could not imagine not having my lashes now. They make such a drastic change to my face. Lily is wonderful, very professional and she doesn't take HOURS like many lash places do!  If you want beautiful lashes, call Lily!  SHE IS AMAZING!!!

I looked on Yelp for carpet cleaners and came across this company. Called them and had a return call from Benjamin within 30 minutes. He came out today and cleaned my carpets and removed pet stains. I am extremely happy with the results. He called before heading over, as agreed, was on time and was extremely professional. Extremely thorough job, no hidden fees and took their time. I will definitely be using this company for all my carpet cleaning needs. Very satisfied!!!
