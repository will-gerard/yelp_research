I can hardly think of a better place to start a weekend than with a breakfast  at Liberty Market. Take a good friend and split an American Standard with meatballs, or just go with a "small" item on the breakfast menu (it won't be that small!) Wash it down with some OJ, a delicious mocha, or just some water. Break out the laptop if you're too busy to really relax, cuz they have free wifi! Still hungry? Pick something from their pastry case (I HIGHLY recommend their grilled, or regular, bread pudding.)

Good hole in the wall! I'm going to try the Ultimate next time, I felt the beef taco would be better with beans :P

Maybe they have better cooks past midnight, but me and my friends (all college guys) tried Gus' for lunch and regretted it. The pork was slimy, we managed half the pizza before considering leaving it in the parking lot. Afterwards we all had a great time in the restroom.  Hopefully the midnight shift has less food poisoning, more deliciousness?

Surprisingly the worst mexican food I've ever had. Even other Macayo's are light years better. Want some dry rice, hot/bland spices, and food that tastes like cardboard? This is your place.  More like a bar than a restaurant.

Absolute best sushi ever. I forgive sometimes-long service because it seems to me that they're a family operation that really cares. I consider myself a sushi lover, and trust me, Sushi Eye is about as good as it gets.  Wait on second thought, don't go here, otherwise I won't be able to get a seat!

The best sushi I've ever had (and I've had a lot of sushi.) Their teriyaki dishes are also amazing, and their green tea brings back memories of Japanese hot springs. The nutty dressing on their salads is unique and delicious.  If you find better-quality sashimi anywhere within driving distance, I'll buy you lunch there!

I had their belgian waffle, which came with bacon and advertised real cream butter and real maple syrup. Also got orange juice and my girlfriend got a salami-egg scramble thing.  The lady's salami-egg scramble was great (and a new taste!) but my waffle was THE BEST WAFFLE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I sipped my tiny $2.50 (I think) orange juice and FELL OFF MY CHAIR, AMAZED BY THE DELICIOUSLY SWEET FRESH SQUEEZED OJ.  After being revived by my frantic girlfriend, I quickly JUMPED UP AND HUGGED EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THE BUILDING.  True story.  We went at 1:30 PM on a Sunday and sat right down-- your mileage may vary as this place is apparently legendary and I hear can attract quite a crowd when busy. There's like 10 small tables in the whole place plus a bar, and virtually no parking, and no shade, so don't expect to be catered to (outside of delicious food.)  Also, Matt has inspired a new invention: fresh squeezed orange juice shots. Seriously, I'd buy a few if they existed.

Not only has everything I've had (in excess of a dozen dishes) been great, but the face-to-face bar atmosphere has made many of the employees friends on a first-name basis. In fact, I'm embarrassed to admit that they remember my name more often than I remember theirs! More than this antisocial nerd can say for most restaurants. Seriously this place is great, and open til midnight. The only way you'll possibly be disappointed is if you hate pasties, soups, and salads, or if you hit them at the peak of rush hour. Why haven't you tried it yet? GET GOING! They're probably still open!

Appearing only after sunset in the parking lot of a tire shop or other similar establishment, Sonoran Hot Dog Food Trucks are an awesome thing to catch, especially late at night when the other normal options would be greasy Mexican or diner food. Try to figure out their schedule, though, because it's not an every-day or all-day thing.

Simply the best thing to happen to the Phoenix technology community ever, period.

I want to love local delivery services that aren't just Fedex/UPS/USPS, but on the third day of attempting to deliver to a business address after 5pm with no visible way for me to affect the process (aside from lengthy phone conversations which I had yesterday) I'm starting to wonder if I could hire Postmates to drive to Amazon's warehouse instead...  Update: the consistent answer from Amazon/Ontrac was that their special Same-Day Service was only able to deliver things between 4pm and 9pm. That's interesting, and massively inconvenient when delivering to a business that closes at 5pm... but they said they would try to put it on an earlier truck to deliver before 5pm. That never happened, on Day 3 apparently they decided that it was undeliverable (with no notification to me all day) and so Amazon is helpfully sending me a new shipment to my home address...  ...via Ontrac Same-Day.  And so today, I get a notification that this new package is already out for delivery as of 7:30AM, a full 7 hours earlier than the last shipment was ever able to get on the truck! We'll see if they deliver before 5pm to my house, or if perhaps this truck's route is indeed 10 hours long. Or maybe it's "out for delivery" and just sitting in a parking lot until 4pm to make their "4-9pm only" logic make sense..? Either way, raising the very interesting question of why they would have a crappy late route for business addresses downtown a few miles from their warehouse, and a super-early-morning route for residential addresses in uptown...  Hire me, Ontrac, I will redo your logistics for free.

Update: the business owner contacted me and said that in order to walk-in you should make an appointment and/or call. Ideally this would be reflected on Yelp/Google/etc.
