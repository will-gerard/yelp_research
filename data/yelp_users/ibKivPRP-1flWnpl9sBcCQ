This place is just eh in my book. I did go in the middle of the day in the middle of the week (on vacation), so it was dead, so that didn't help the vibe. But the food just was not good. Really, no flavor in the tacos or queso. I just wouldn't recommend it or head back if I were back in the area.

This hotel gets the job done. It's very convenient to Old Town Scottsdale and transportation, and the price is just right. It has a nice, quiet pool and a bar. It's a great hotel for a vacation when you'll be out and about for the day. Who needs all the bells and whistles when you'll just be sleeping there? It was perfect for our needs and within walking distance of so many places. We didn't even have a car during our trip.

I was in Scottsdale for only a week, and I ate at Daily Dose three times. That's how awesome it is. You have to try the breakfast nachos if you're there at the right time: Warm corn tortilla chips topped with mozzarella and cheddar cheese, jalapenos, chorizo scrambled eggs, pico de gallo and red chili cheese sauce. Served with a side of sausage gravy. I said I was on vacation. That included from my diet. I'll be dreaming of those tonight.
