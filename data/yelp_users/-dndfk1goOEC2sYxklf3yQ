My standby for a hot summer day meal. Great build your own salad bar, so many veggies to choose from  & dressings. Good ice tea, lemonade also for those hot days. They also have a great selection of soups(I usually stay away from during the summer already hot outside) pastas, potatoes & muffins fruit & desserts with a healthy twist.

Dells pizza is the best in town. The crust comes only one way & my favorite toppings are beef with green chiles, the cheese is layered nicely. They have good wings & other bar foods too that are good. The pizza burger is pretty good.

My favorite Mexican food place. Been going here since as far back as I can remember. I have never found a place with better cheese crisps then Ricardo's. I have tried almost everything on the menu but the #3 is my usual standby. Also great ice tea.

Great place for Mongolian bbq. Pick the meat, noodles, veggies, & sauces. Fill your bowl over the top & watch them cook it. White & brown rice, 2 types of soup & wonton chips. You can get at least 2 meals out of it if you set it up right

Great place to eat for soul food. Best chicken & waffles. I stick with the chicken omelette, it is the best thing. Also the chicken fried chicken is awesome.

Pretty good basic burger, add green chiles to make it a great burger. I highly recommend this place & there burgers. But it's cash only so hit the atm first.

Great brisket & chicken, bbq sauce was good, just had a little taste. Friends enjoyed the cheesy potatoes & apple crisp. Would recommend it to anyone. Also the outside dining would be great for the fall or winter

Another great meal at pita jungle. So far I have never had a bad meal & I'm usually at one of these place twice a week. The jalape√±o hummus should be illegal for being so delicious. The chicken is so yummy, I get it every meal in some form. The green tea is the best I have ever had. Keep up the great food pita jungle I am hooked.

Great brisket, they could use a few more sides. But the brisket is the best in Phoenix I have had so far. The smoked turkey is good too. The regular bbq sauce is good & has a nice kick. If you look spicy & green chiles you've gotta try the green chile stew its a meal in itself

It is never good when you leave a restaurant hungry. I had read the great reviews for Reds and was looking forward to trying it. From the start the disappointment began. Seating was awkward, waiter seemed lost. No chips in salsa was ready, we placed our orders but still none. Finally got them they were greasy but we were starving, salsa was very good. As we watched the staff run around as if they were chicken with their heads cut off we didn't know whether to laugh or be scared. Disorganization at its highest was evident here. The other patrons seemed to feel it just as much. Finally the food arrived but no silverware, I asked one of the confused waitstaff for some then another about 5 minutes later they came towards me with some but gave it to another table who didn't even order yet. I asked another for some at received it finally. Maybe the first waiter was trying to save me from eating the food, but my hunger was extreme, so I dove in then realized that I should have just went to Taco Bell. I ordered a taco salad with chicken & carne. The chicken was bland the carne burnt. But worse was they washed the lettuce but didn't dry leaving 3 inches of water on the bottom. This was disgusting. My companion had the chicken street tacos they were decent but again bland chicken. One good note was the rice & beans were delicious or was I just fooled by the bad taste of the other food I consumed. We may have visited them on a busy day but my experience shows that those who have great systems, great food overcome this & shine. If they can not handle a busy day maybe they should not be in business. Hopefully they will reevaluate their systems fix them.

Came here for Father's Day. What a major mistake. Do not come here unless you enjoy burnt burgers & burnt steaks. Waitress brought food I asked if the burgers & steaks are suppose to be burnt she said that when you flame grill them they get burnt. What a joke. They did comp the steak & burger, but when you go to place named Texas Roadhouse & they have a sign that says handcut steaks you think they would know how to cook a medium steak & a burger. My daughters did enjoy the ribs.

So came back to Texas Roadhouse today & it was like going to another place entirely. Steak was great perfectly cooked & waitress Kari was great. I guess everyone deserves a second chance. Good job Texas Roadhouse
