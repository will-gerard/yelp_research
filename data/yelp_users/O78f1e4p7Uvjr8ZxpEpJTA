The black bean fritters are fantastic and the Papa Rellena was absolutely to die for. The Sangria is $28 for a pitcher and that is about 8 glasses so a good deal and it was delicious. Service is a bit slow, but an enjoyable place none the less.

I loved every aspect of Suzanne's Bridal. I came for Maggie Sottero and ended up in one of her dresses. The shopping process is the easy part, the alterations is where you really need someone who knows what they are doing and boy does Suzanne know! My dress had a very intricate lace and bead bottom and train and after looking at the finished product you never would guess it was not made to fit me exactly. Suzanne is not only amazing at what she does, but she is a caring and nice lady as well. I believe she truly loves all her brides.

Been wanting to try this place for awhile. Saw that they were doing restaurant week and came in. Food was great but the stand out was the mango mousse cake was amazing!!!

Blooming Bouquets came as part of my wedding package and I am happy they did. My bouquet of Picasso lilies was amazingly beautiful and my bridesmaids' tulips were gorgeous. They also did my reception centerpieces and I loved them as well. Highly recommended for wedding flowers.

Amazing and honest shop. They do not try to upsell me or push me to do unnecessary things to my car. Will not go anywhere else and recommend to anyone looking for auto repair.

Pixy Cakes was part of my wedding package and I am so happy they were. I am dairy free and they played around with recipes to make sure I had plenty of flavor options to taste. They also even made a dairy free cream filling in all different flavors for me as well. In the end I picked a coconut cake with a strawberry cream filling. It was dairy free and sooo delicious! I also really wanted lilies on my cake, but they are toxic so they made me sugar lilies in my wedding colors. My only complaint is they are not in Ahwatukee near my house!

Their website and sign on the door say they are open until 7pm. Got there at 6:20pm and the doors were locked. Was looking forward to trying them out but went to Sweet Daddy Cupcakes instead who stays open until their stated time.

Great place.  I have the monthly membership and can use the express lane to get in and out quick, and when I upgrade to the ultimate wash they always do a great job.  The staff are very friendly and go above and beyond to satisfy their customers!

Our wedding was 5-1-15 and it was a dream day for us. Chelsea and Rosemary, the sales team/wedding coordinators extraordinaire, went above and beyond all of our expectations and pulled off our day without any glitches. The ceremony site is absolutely gorgeous and gave us beautiful photos. The reception area is equally as beautiful when decorated. Though I did not really eat any of the food (I was just too busy socializing and dancing), all of our guests said it was amazing. I am dairy free and the catering team did make me a special dairy free plate that was very nice of them. I would recommend Wedgewood, Chelsea, and Rosemary to everyone I know!
