If you happen to drive a long way just to find yourself at the Barrio Cafe, on a Monday afternoon, and then notice the sign that says they are closed on Monday's, then I've got a great solution for you.  Head south-east my friend, over to Rosita's.  This is a great little 'hole in the wall' eatery.  I wasn't disappointed, and neither was the group I had in tow.  Their re-fried beans were so creamy and flavour-ful.  Yeah, that's right, I used a 'u' in flavour, because they're that good.  Next time I'm in the area, I plan on giving the frozen horchata with coconut rum a taste.  Be forewarned, the place is small, so if there is a group of cackling hens at the table behind you doing tequila shooters, it will make for a vexing dining experience.

When I wanted to send an arrangement to a friend at Barrow Neurological Institute, I opted to choose a local florist rather than FTD, and I am so glad I did.  The owner was so incredibly helpful that I will never use another florist.  Let me explain.  I called the hospital to get my friend's room number.  I asked the representative if my friend could have flowers in her room, to which he replied, "Yes".  At that point I called McDonald and placed the order.  The florist called me later that day saying that the hospital refused delivery since my friend was in ICU, but they would keep checking back, as if she was moved to a recovery room, they could make the delivery.  They were unable to make the delivery for a week and a half, but the florist kept me up to date every few days.  When my friend was released, the florist called me saying they would re-make the arrangement, since it had to sit for so long.  I asked if they would delivery to my friend's east valley residence, and they did for a very reasonable fee.  I love these guys.

After Linh finished shooting me, I asked him where he wanted to go for dinner.  "What are you feeling like, bro?", I asked.  "Soup sounds good"... and yes, it did sound good on this cold night.  So, we feasted like kings on salad and things.  The pozole, with fresh chopped green chiles you can add, was a delicious offering.  Throw some chopped onions, cheese and sour cream in.  It's basically a liquid burrito anyways.  But the star of the show, the one main stand out of the night, was the coconut muffins.  I am ashamed to say that I killed a dozen that night.  They were so good, we each took 4 home with us, discretely wrapped in white napkins.  We each looked like we were walking out with a small pillow in our hands.

We ended up visiting this restaurant one day, after our barista at Starbucks mentioned how the patrons at her 'other job' weren't tipping well, forcing her to hold an alternate vocation at the coffee giant.  So we show up later that evening.  Anyways, the decor is rustic but outdated.  The menu is limited, and you have no options.  "What do you mean by no options", you ask?  What type of salad dressing would you like?  Ranch?  Not a fan of Ranch?  Are you sure?  Because that's all they have to serve with their cheap iceburg salad mix.  And to spice things up a bit, they throw in a few whole cherry tomatoes.  And do you like corn on the cob, and diced sweet potatoes sauteed in butter and brown sugar?  I hope so, because that's all you gonna get.  Sound appetizing?  Sweet and buttery concoctions making their way across the plate toward  your meaty centerpiece.  My wife ordered the 'Deputy' Prime Rib, which was the most un-flavorful piece of meat she recalls having, and the au-jus being just warmed beef broth, void of flavor.  I ordered the 'Trail Hand' T-Bone, because I like T-Bones.  You should just call me 'T-Bone'.  Anyways, I asked them to serve it rare, because I had a hankering for a juicy cut of steak.  It was incredibly bland, and destitute of the juice I craved.  It wasn't dry.  More like a raw piece of steak.  Wanting to salvage the evening, I scanned the dessert menu for a hidden gem.  Strike three.  The apple pie we chose was unanimously nominated for the worst ever.  The dough was either overkneaded, or cooked in a microwave.  Kind of stretchy.  A few bites into this, and we knew... prognosis negative.  This review gets 2 stars, with one of those stars coming from the entertainment.  Yes, the one bright spot was the live music.  The band sounded great.  This trip turned out to be a complete WASTE of money that would have been better served back at the Seattle Conglomerate.

Purchased the Discover Scuba course via Groupon, and had a total blast!  Wasn't sure I'd be able to convince myself to actually breathe under water, but was pleasantly surprised when I did.  If you'd like to see if scuba is for you, the price is very reasonable.  Only $25 for a course that runs about 3 hours.  Tell em Swoop sent ya.

I called Ray based on Chris' review.  I was looking for a mechanic to quickly look over particular cars that I'm considering for my daughter.  Ray gave me a good price, made an appointment for the next day, and gave us some personal advice about the car, besides just what he had found wrong with it.  I trust Ray, and will continue to use him as I look for a suitable car to put my baby in.

This is one of my all time favorites.  I love their breakfast entrees, their soup & sandwich lunchtime combos, and their award winning blackberry brandied bread pudding.  That is the best ever!  And if you're dining fantasies include being served by Hugh Jackman, then make sure to ask for Travis' section.  Yeah, he's a little shorter than Wolverine, but he looks and sounds strikingly similar.

What can one say about a single location of a chain restaurant like Del Taco besides: a. They always get my order right (which they do) b. The employees have a great grasp of the English language (which they do)  Well, I can testify that this particular Del Taco made one of my wildest pubescent dreams come true.  It's like this... what teenage boy hasn't mused that if he had a pair of ta-tas, he'd keep himself amused for hours.  I was no different.  Then somewhere in my twenties, Del Taco came strolling into my life, with their thick and creamy strawberry shakes, made with a generous helping of real fruit!  The key to my youthful desire lied within this sweet polar potion... it was called lipids... aka milk fat.  Let me tell you friends, the grass isn't always greener.  I'm not amused... not at all.  There's nothing alluring about a tufted teat.  They bounce; they sag; and they can percolate perspiration like Michael Vick at a PETA rally in Death Valley... on a really hot day.  And no one seems to care.  Seinfeld conceptualized the 'manzier', but I've yet to see one for sale.  I'd have to say my lowest point came while at a water park with friends, one of which brought their new baby.  While relaxing in a lounge chair under the awning by the wave pool, they asked if I wanted to hold little Abigail.  Sure, I love kids.  As I was sitting there with this little cutie, I noticed other people were gawking at me.  When I looked down to check on Abby, I noticed that her mouth was firmly latched on to my right mammary.  That's right children, come suckle daddy's sugarball.  My nonchalant extrication efforts didn't pan out, and the worst part was that I thought I felt seepage.  With pretty much nothing left to lose, I wedged my left index finger between my swollen nip and lil-miss-hoover's mouth until I heard decompression.  Baby-go-back-to-Mama.  In conclusion, I'd like to think there's a lesson here we can all learn from.  Yeah.  ~Swoop

The first thing I noticed after being seated in the pedacure throne, is that its really cramped. Spinning this positively, I would say they make great use of their real estate.  And LOUD.  This place gets loud when its busy.  The pedicure wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  I was having a hard time understanding my lady, but then again I don't understand a lot of people.  One lady was working in a nice black dress.  She sounded a lot like Anjelah Johnson.  "Oh huney... you so per-tty.. like mah-duhl."  So, no, I don't plan on coming back, unless I'm in a pedi bind.  Now for the hammer.  The sign on their window states "$17.99 Pedicure". However, they charged my wife and I twenty-dollah.  And, no, we didn't get anything ec-tra.  As Kip Dynamite would say: "Geeze, that place was a rip off!"

I hope you'll never find yourself in a situation which would require the services of an animal hospital, but if so, let me highly recommend First Regional.  Two weeks ago, we suddenly and unexpectedly lost our special little boy Roman.  It was quite devastating to lose such a happy and loving dog who had been part of our family for the last six years.  Grief aside, my wife and I wanted to schedule an autopsy in order to find out what happened.  We found out the body needed to be chilled in order to have one performed.  We were recommended to FRAH, who provided us this service for FREE.  As we walked in the side door with our Roman, who was wrapped in a baby blue blanket, we were offered a private room so we could grieve in private.  I'm sure it made the others in the waiting room more comfortable as well.  The staff here is very compassionate.  Contrived empathy is pretty transparent, so I know the people who spoke with us that night related with our heartbreak.  We received several hugs from staff members, and words of encouragement.  Our pup was treated with the utmost respect, and when we picked him up, they had laid him in an unassuming sealed white cardboard coffin.  And two weeks later, a memorial paw print was delivered to our residence.  It will serve as a reminder of the kindness we were shown at FRAH.

The reason I love this pool is because its much much less crowded than my favorite Chandler pool: Mesquite Groves.  I can usually show up around 2pm and get a recliner, and start working on this tan that my doctor told me to stop working on.  My granddaughter also loves the water mushroom, the little kids slide and the cute little whale slide.  They have a few lap lanes if you feel so inclined, and two big kid water slides.  Sometimes the snack bar is open, but not when I came yesterday or today.  So take that, old Papa John's pizza slices!

Sigh.  The taco plate was skimpy and bland.  I don't mind getting a small portion, but don't charge me $8.21 for it.  Get ready to drench your flavor-challenged tacos in hot sauce.  Maybe try a burrito instead?  One word: disappointing.

If you know of a better chicken ceasar salad, then please let me know, because Floridino's makes my favorite.  One of these, and a couple of their pizza muffins, and I'm a happy boy.  I also love their thin crust pizza.  And talk about affordable lunch specials!

Popped in the other day.  My wife ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and I got me a chicken caesar salad.  Where to begin?  Lets start with portion size.  We weren't looking for some hefty size portion, but if this was for a grown man, they would have laughed and said thanks for the sampler.  The meatballs were pretty small too, and probably came from a restaurant supply house.  The sauce tasted exactly like they opened up a can of crushed tomatoes and heated it up.  Very bland, no flavor or visible herbs/seasonings.  I'm not a gambler, but I would bet this was a purchased sauce... and being a family owned business, this was quite unexpected.  My salad came out quick... too quick.  My chicken wasn't hot.  It had been sitting around a while.  That made a big difference in taste.  In my opinion, Floridino's has a great chicken caesar salad... BUT only if you get fresh chicken.  Specifically ASK for fresh and hot chicken!  I will.  As we walked out, I noticed a boxing gym in the same strip mall area.  I gots ta check that out.

"Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dogs eye" -John L  I strolled in on a balmy Monday afternoon, and was immediately greeted by the concierge.  After some playful banter, she located an open room and had me whisked to my accommodations.  There was a bed, two TVs and a bevy of portable latrines to help make my stay as pleasant as possible.  The chambermaid assigned to my lodging sweet talked the shirt right off my back, and provided me with an exquisite gown which had the touch, the feel... of cotton, the fabric of my life.  What luck, I had arrived just in time for happy hour!  Since I probably looked like I could handle my liquid, they started not one, but two IVs... and plugged me into the EKG.  I looked like Keanu Reeves from the first Matrix, after he was awoken.  Now Mr Neo may have been skilled at dodging bullets and combat kung-fu, but I'd like to see him roll over on his side, unzip, and take a leak into a plastic bottle, maneuvering with only one hand, while an old lady screams in the next room from her blood draw... all this without spilling a drop.  It took a while, but I was finally upgraded to a new private room.  Looking at the bed, I thought back to all the lodging advice I've ever received.  You don't know what kind of DNA is on the comforter, and they never wash it.  But here, I also had to worry about the extended set of bodily fluids... like vitreous humor, which coincidentally is where VH-1 came from.  It was essentially a nod to John Lennon's obscure "Walrus" lyrics.  I'd love to give this place a 5-star rating, but I've NEVER been to a hotel where the maintenance crew enters the room every 3 hours, flipping the overhead light on, startling the crap out of you.  It's like... dude, I'm in here for a heart thingie.  Are ya TRYING to scare me into a flat-line?  And the comestibles, while filling, wasn't the flavor circus I had found at other eateries.  But I've got a feeling after I get the bill, it will prove to be more expensive than a night at the French Laundry.

I love everything here, but what makes Si Senor really stand out?  * Fantastic hot green chile. * Chips with 4 great tasting dips. * Sopapillas coated with cinnamon & sugar.  It can get very crowded at lunch.  The place opens at 10:30am.  Choose your arrival time wisely.

Don't think I'll be back. I just get the feeling they are trying to sell me on stuff I just don't need yet, but I'll bring it to another brake place next week to see if they concur.  I'd hate to cast presumptious aspersions.

I'm starting to get the hang of Indian food, and as George Costanza would say: "I'm Loving It !".  So when a friend suggested an Indian buffet, I was all over it.  India Gate is great, not pretentious or over the top, with a good sized menu, oh but I didn't want the menu Georgie, I wanted the buffet.  It had all of my favorites like palak paneer and matter paneer, plus some new favorites like the minced lamb and green chutney.  I love their lunch buffet and stop by at least twice a month, but I was unimpressed with the lamb vindaloo entree from the menu. The lamb was tough and had gristle. Boo Gristle... Hooray Beer!

Came back for my daughter's 19th celebration, and the staff didn't disappoint this time.  Still cant rave enough about the avocado eggrolls and the crusted chicken romano.  If you like the flavor of the islands, you simply have to try their new pina colada cake cheesecake.  Scrumptious!

Still impressed by their avocado egg rolls, and the accompanying dipping sauce (cilantro, honey, lime, garlic, etc) was tap dancing all over my taste buds.  I'd love to have my wife replicate that so we can test out what other foods it would accommodate.  What I wasn't impressed with was their herb-crusted salmon salad.  Maybe it was the word 'crusted' that got me, but I was assuming the fish was going to be served warm.  Surprise!  It was cold.  I choked down as much as I could, but will be going to Pita Jungle and Keegan's for my salmon salads from now on.  And I cant say enough about their pina colada cake cheesecake.  A true taste of the islands, part cake, part cheesecake, all yummy.  The only things missing were the fire dancers and hula girls.  They do take reservations... for parties of 20 or more.

It's easy like Sunday morning. Actually it's busy on Sunday morning.  They have a pastry case which beats out both Starbucks & Paradise combined, but would you expect less from a bread company?  I ordered my standard soy latte with sugar free vanilla, and it was good!  Dare I say better than the one Paradise sells?  Yes, I dare.  I also went with the Peach Bran muffin.  My first bite from the top of the muffin contained a large slice of sweet peach.  Delicious.  The muffin top was fairly moist, but the muffin rump was a little dry.  I'll be back to try the Blueberry pancakes Sarah wrote about.

I love this place.  $5.50 for an 8-piece spicy tuna roll.  The cashier was very friendly... and don't tell anyone... she gave me a free miso soup when I told her I had never tried it.  Now don't just walk in the place and announce you've never had miso soup before.  I don't want this place going out of business from all the free-loaders out there.

My rating is based on this first review... not on the second.  On my first visit to Z Tejas, I went at lunchtime with 2 guys from Boeing.  We had to sit at the bar since the restaurant was so crowded.  As I scanned the menu, the Grilled Green Chile Pork Enchiladas with green chile sauce and a tomato-avocado chopped salad caught my eye... and I'm glad it did.  I dont necessarily consider myself an 'enchilada' type of guy, but this dish provided me with the best I've ever tasted.  I recommend this dish, with no reservations.  Now for my second review.  My boss and I headed to Z Tejas today.  I figured that I'd mix it up and try something new.  Bad choice.  I was feeling a bit famished, so I ordered the more expensive menu item, which was Jack's Five-Cheese Macaroni Achiote.  The grilled chicken with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and romano cheeses and bacon gratin sounded like a complete winner.  Where to begin?  The dish incorporates real cheese, which I would normally find appetizing.  However, in this case, the entree was served piping hot, causing the cheese to string everywhere.  Kind of messy for a lunchtime meal.    So, I ate slow, in hopes that the threadlike curd would solidify some.  Well, it did, but it also left, what can only be depicted as an oily scramble, in the bottom of the bowl, due to separation.  Delectable!  Well, I decided to ease up on the 'roni, and move on to the chicken, which was served with skin on.  Visually, the skin looked crispy... but I realized my peepers were punked when I chewed up on some rubbery epidermis.  Swoop Says: skip the mac 'n cheeze, go for the whole enchilada!   In other news, the server at the bar was top notch.  She refilled my palmer again and again, until my bladder shouted: 'Uncle!'.  When you need some pampering, saddle up to the bar.

I came because AMEX gave me a $40 gift card, but I stayed because I was totes hungry.  It was very fancy, from the moment I sashayed my pretty little self in, to the time I was escorted to my white linened table, with their newfangled iPad wine and dessert list.  The parmesan crusty loaf was accompanied by both a feta and sundried tomato spreads, but I like Firebird's bolero loaf better.  The water tasted chlorinated though.  I could understand maybe bleach, ya know, for whiter teeth  Once again, I chose the wrong venue to sport my lederhosen and ICP mesh half shirt.  This place was popping, at 9:30pm.  It's nice to see the older generation still having date nights... with what appears to be their granddaughters.  :/  My waitress, Megan was an old soul and classy delight.  I am nearly transported to the days of old Hollywood, when people had nannies and rode elevators.  This is surely out of my element, but tonight, I'm self medicating, without the alcohol or Mexican quaaludes.  The bone in ribeye was near sheer perfection, with a taste that eschewed my typical topping of gefilte fish with cream.  The Thai green beans were a lil spicy, and a lot of fun.  And I'm pretty sure my Spidey senses were tingling thanks to some green Chile in the taters.  You know... PO-TA-TOES... boil em, mash em, stick em in a stew

The first thing I noticed was its nice patio area.  The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.  My wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.  I was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.  While we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.  My cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.  The cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.  The saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.  Their dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?  Where's the allure?  Sorry Liberty Market.  Our first trip was very disappointing, which means it will probably be our last.

I attended a free Emergency Road and Mountain Bike Clinic last night, and was very impressed with how prepared they were.  I discovered the clinic through Meetup.com  This was a 'no sales pressure' clinic, full of advice, real world stories, and hands on demonstrations.  I was familiar with most of the material, but managed to pick up several good habits which I look forward to using.  I also learned about tire boots.  They also covered chain wear, and hosted a hands on chain replacement workshop at the end of the clinic.  Brandee thanked me for coming, and invited me to the triathlon clinic.  The shop is big enough to accommodate 12 seats with a display table in the back part of their store.  The area was well lit, and at a comfortable temperature.  I could easily hear both presenters during the whole clinic.  Global Bikes is going to be putting on more clinics, with different topics, such as triathlon training with a bike.  They also offer discounts at their clinics, and you get to meet up with other east valley riders, and possibly find a new riding crew.  Global Bikes are also one of the few local shops that sells the Specialized Armadillo flat resistant tires.  If you're tired of the amount of times you've had to change out a tube, then take a look at this product.  Global offers several services, including a 45 minute bike fitting, where they check you against your bike, and make adjustments to provide for the most comfortable ride possible.  If you're cramping in your upper body, getting shoulder strain, or a sore back, if may be time to get your bike fitted to your body.

I ordered the large Awesome Balsam balsamic salad, and it was fabulous.  Spring salad mix with marinated mushrooms, roasted red peppers and balsamic chicken.  It came with a unique balsamic dressing, and made quite the impression.  Two words... LOVE IT!  My wife ordered the Ace of Clubs, which is a club sandwich with avocado.  It comes a green chile mayonnaise, and there was very little green chile flavor.  She wouldn't order it again, but would definitely go back to try a different sandwich.  We tried the apple blueberry cobbler, and were kind of surprised when we saw it come with a classic oatmeal crumble top.  We prefer a crust topping.  Every entree that we noticed servers walking by with, looked delicious.  The wait staff was very friendly, and so was the manager, who was making the rounds, checking on customer satisfaction.

If you live in the east valley, and are considering signing up at the Gilbert location, do yourself a favor and sign up here (the Ocotillo location) instead.  When you do, you will have total access to Gilbert, and total access to Ocotillo (which is so much nicer than Gilbert).  And if you think you can handle an intense cycle class, let me be the first to encourage you to show up for Tracy's (TW) 6pm Thursday cycling extravaganza, or Trish's (TV) HIGH ENERGY classes Wed @ 5:30 and Fri @ 4:30.  I broke a sweat in under four minutes.  http://www.mountainsidefitness.com/ocotillo_classes.html  Oh, and bring a water bottle.

Ever since I heard how Jake Gyllenhaal got ripped, I've been visiting Mountainside for more than just a fantastic high pressured shower... which I do stop by at least once a day for.  Can you imagine how much $$$ I'm saving by not having to buy Axe body wash... or launder my own towels?  Anyway, word on the street is, that Jake spent hours in the gym, racking up 2000 sit-ups on any given day, prepping for his part in Southpaw.  I understand no one is waving $20mil in my face for a leading role, but I'd like to have a toner core, so I'm taking that Jake challenge.  Today, I'm up to 601 sit-ups on the half bosu ball.  The trick is to knock them out in sets of 50, and to do each set in under 3 minutes.  Just dont squander your intermission between sets.  You can throw in some push-ups or whip out your phone and time your max plank hold.  And you can set up on the complete opposite side from the free-weights area, so as to avoid feeling shame from your less-manly floor exercises  And I'd like to go on record saying: I'll give serious consideration to any movie role offered, paying 1M or more, whether I've hit the 2k mark or not

If I could afford it, I would come here every day and order their blackened salmon salad.  Roasted Corn & Red Bell Pepper Salsa, Edamame Beans, Tomatoes & Multigrain Tortilla Chips with a balsamic dressing.  My absolute favorite, hands down, and it pairs well with their arnold palmer.

I've had a great pedicure both times I've been here. The ladies really worked on my callouses.  From this guy's perspective, Cute Nails is a salon I'd return to for my next foot grooming.  But be forewarned, they are about $7 more expensive per pedi than most other nail shops in the area.  Also, while they take credit cards (preferring to run as debit), they require you to tip via cash.

Before reaming these guys, I will start by saying I really appreciated the Friday night quick delivery and thought the wings were good.  With that said...  If you like thick doughy pizza, defrosted translucent-wilted salad, and rude customer service from a manager by the name of Kendra, then BOY do we have a pizza place for you.  Pretty much, everyone knows that salad is one of the riskiest items on any menu, being one of the biggest bacteria carriers.  Our disappointment with this order began with what we found in the garden salad container.  My wife, being ServSafe certified, noticed a significant portion of lettuce (which seemed to have been frozen and thawed) which was translucent and visually unappealing.   We've posted the photos so you can see for yourself, but unfortunately Yelp removed them on 12/14/12 because "...your photos looked more like they captured your personal experience".  Umm k.  My wife phoned to bring this to the attention of a manager.  She politely explained that they may want to check their salad, to keep other customers safe, and requested a refund (for the price of the salad only).  I listened in, and can confirm how polite she was.  The manager, Kendra, wanted to give us credit instead.  My wife explained that we don't plan on ordering from Barro's in the future, and would just like the salad price refunded.  The obviously annoyed Kendra replied "OK!" and then hung the phone up.  No apology, no thanks for reporting potentially out of temperature food.  Nothing but the echo of a dial tone in our receiver.  The pizza tasted good, but the texture is accommodating to those who prefer a thick and doughy crust.  There are too many other pizza places to put up with potentially tainted food and substandard customer service.  No thanks Barro's.

2 large cokes for almost $5 !?!?  Hell with you, czar of sirloin!  I'm going to McDonalds, Carl's Jr or QuikTrip from now on.

Its the closest grocery to my home, but I love it for so many more reasons.  Tully's inside, pharmacy with free fry's cash for transferred prescriptions, good produce and meat, gas discounts for the station across the street, and RedBox.  The only downside is the sometimes over-crowded parking lot.

I've been here like six times, and the food is phenomenal, and the service is a-ok!  Just know what you want before coming in.  Practice orating it before you walk in that door.  As you walk in the place, step immediately to your right.  The main thing is to keep the line moving.  Announce your order with a loud clear voice... "I would like one slice of pepperoni, one slice of pepperoni and sausage, and a third slice of pepperoni and mushroom"  It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.  At most, you can say... "Can I get that extra crispy?".  If he gives you 'that' look, just drop it an move on.  Then you hold out your money and step to the left.  If using a credit card, insert it into the chip reader on the counter.  Take your receipt and find yourself a booth.  They will call out the pizza order when its ready, so listen up, yous!

Grab yourself a white hot, or whatever other flame broiled tube steak that does it for you, and have a seat.  Wait, get some fries or rings with that.  Like a dinner and a show?  While you're waiting in line, you get to watch the grill masters at their culinary best.  I thought Buffalo NY was known for chicken wings and grain elevators, but apparently they know a thing or two about serving up and incredible meat-by-product encased in sheepskin (actually, I think its the small intestine of sheep).  So far, I haven't gotten any dogs which are ribbed (for my or anyone else's pleasure).  Come out and get a taste of Buffalo, because if you like hot dogs, then you'll love what Ted's has to offer.  -Swoop

Once again, this is a chain, so you know what you're getting when you walk in the door.  This particular location isn't my favorite, and I cant really quantify why.  Maybe its because the place is usually packed when I decide to show up.  Maybe I was just bloated and irritated each of the two times that I creased their cushions.  Anyway, I like wings, and I LOVE the BWW (not BBW) Asian Zing.  Its sweet, its spicy... kind of like Charo on the Surreal Life.  You gotta admit, she's pretty hot for being what... 89 years old.  Hey you wacky vegetarians... check out their garden burger.  This omnivore says: "Pretty darn good".  -Swoop

This is one of my favorite theaters.  With that said, I suggest you prepare yourself for having to wade through an onslaught of pre-teen cliques if you plan on making your way to the ticket counter on a Friday or Saturday evening.  If you're like me, safety is a concern.  Not to worry here.  I've always seen an officer on premises during the main drop-the-kids-off / pick-the-kids-up window.  This location still has a new feeling to it, and it is clean and cool.  Nice cushy seats with cup holders, and I have yet to hear the soles of my shoes stick to the floor as I walk down an aisle.  My favorite seats are the ones with the railing in front.  A place to perch my feet.  -Swoop

Location, location, location.  This Chipotle is in a great location, seeing as the Wallace Theater (or now its something like Hollywood Theater) is minutes away (by electric wheelchair).  The staff has ALWAYS been friendly.  The dining area is always clean.  I'm not a big 'salad' kind of guy, but I'll take the Chipotle chicken salad with rice and pinto any day.  Their medium salsa is my idea of a perfect salad dressing, but if you are more traditional, you can get their house dressing.  I like to top off my salad (or as Sponge Bob would say: "sahh lahd") with a dollop of freshly made guacamole.  When you go to a chain like Chipotle, you know what kind of food you're going to get.  When you come to this location,  you also get great ambiance.  -Swoop

Stopped in here before a Diamondbacks game, because we had just learned that the Copper Door (located a few feet away) was no longer in business.  Hey, it really smelled like a bar... but it is a bar, so good job!  The fish and chips were OK.  The Irish stew was OK.  The Blue Moon had a big wedge of orange, and it was great.  They had bottled Bud Light.  And the review from "suneel t." wonderfully described the patrons.

First of all, I want to thank the powers that be for the comped tix.  See you in April as a paying spectator.  I really enjoyed the performance... but at first I didn't get it... until I realized that they used the same actors to represent multiple characters.  I couldn't take my eyes off of Anna Bullard, who played Elizabeth.  What is it about women with long ringlets of red hair, who go weak in the knees at the sight of your dagger which you hold menacingly to their throats?  Thank you ATC for letting me feel cultured and refined, if even for only one enchanted evening.  But the guy in me still wishes there was more karate... and a pirate.  [Updated March 31 2008] I was invited back to watch the opening night of To Kill A Mockingbird, and had great seats (4th row).  This time, the kids stole the show, especially Daria as Scout.  I admired John's character, Atticus; despised Scott's character, Bob; and jumped about three inches out of my seat when someone thought it would be a good idea to bust a cap.  I told my co-worker about it, and he purchased 4 balcony seats, first row.  If I can find a date, I'll go back... providing they are not sold out!  Any takers?

I walked 6.41 miles today for a Bosa donut, because they're that good.  This morning, I purchased a diverse array of the sweet deep-fried treats to go.  When I arrived home, I portioned each donut into several bite sized segments, so everyone could get a sampling.  The apple fritter was crispy on the outside with a fluffy interior.  Probably the best I've had.  The bear-claw was off the chain, with an apple filling.  The cinnamon rolls were large, and were pretty good, but the tractor wheel ones were unbelievable.  After completing my tasting course, I estimated the consumed calories to be approx 800, so I set off of a journey to burn it off.  A 6.41 mile jog/walk took care of my little indiscretion, plus a a smidge more.  I don't get sweet treats often, and Bosa was well worth it.

I've only come here for pedicures. They usually do a great job, and give you your money's worth when you spring a little extra for the callous remover.  The chairs are pretty comfortable, and have the electronic vibration and massage settings, so lay back and drift off on a sea of comfort.  I'm not a fan of the sea salt scrub, so I can't comment on theirs.  Don't be a cheap-o. Bring cash to tip with.  Heck, bring cash to pay with as well.

Wow, we rolled up for breakfast, and were pleasantly surprised.  My wife ordered a breakfast style burro with their green chile, and I asked if they had chilaquiles... WHICH THEY DID!  Yeah, its not on their menu, but the chef will whip an order up for you.  Their enchilada sauce perfectly complemented this dish.  Their chips and salsa were tasty, and my wife's burro was delectable.  Really, it was delectable.  I'm not just repetitiously writing the word delectable for the hell of it.  I'll be bringing the familia back to check them out for lunch, or maybe dinner fare.  And if Shakira happens to be in the neighborhood, she can come too.

My date and I stopped by for dinner before our evening at the Herberger.  We've heard friends compliment this establishment, so we were curious to try it.  I had the blackened salmon, and my date went with the prime rib.  The fish was a tad overcooked.  However, the prime rib was the largest cut I can recall seeing.  And it wasn't mostly fat.  It was a thing of beauty.  Every bite of the salmon mocked me.  Oh why didn't I get the prime rib?  Because, the doctor recommended I restrict my intake of red meat.  But I did manage to sneak a bite, and it was so juicy and flavorful.  There was also live music on the patio.  About twelve feet behind me.  And had it not been for the Pino, the high-decibel dis-harmonies of 'Lay Down Sally' would have surely escorted me to the theater with a migraine.  And yes, I paired red with fish.  Go there tonight, and order the prime rib.

Maybe I'm easily pleased, but I love this store.  From the Starbucks, to the sandwich counter, to the bakery, to the vast array of gift cards I can give for birthday's/anniversary's, because I don't have much of an imagination.  I love their Eating Right line of frozen foods, and the produce is pretty good.  Too bad I moved too far away to make this a regular stop.

Very impressed with the menu items I've tried so far.  Ranking at the top is their green chile burrito, which is beef, not pork, but that's ok.  The taste is there, and is every bit as good as El Zocalo's, just different.  Coming in a close second is their bean and cheese cone.  Yeah, I didn't know what to think when I saw it advertised on their wall, but since it was a 'dollar menu' item, I was down.  It surpassed my wildest expectations.  The 'cone' was a fantastic deep fried flour tortilla.  I got it for my grand daughter, but ended up eating half of it.  Bad Grandpa.  Pulling up in third place was their green chicken mini burro.  Just the right size, and tasted great.  Elmer's is now on my radar when I'm hankering for local Mexican fare.  And 'bean and cheese cone'... we will meet again, and again.

I'm a guy.  I like watching planes.  I like watching old WWI style biplanes.  I like watching attractive women get in and out of old WWI style biplanes.  And I like doing all of the above while having breakfast.  Sometimes, while sitting outside, you get to overhear compelling conversations.  "You know its hard buying underwear for you.  You have your father's irregular crotch."  My previous supervisor took me here one day for breakfast.  After a quick glance at the menu, I ordered an egg breakfast for under $4.  What a deal!  Turns out, it was basically an egg mcmuffin.  So much for the deal, but you cant beat the ambiance.  I took my wife here a few weeks ago, and she loved it.  One of my favorite places for breakfast.

The only negative aspect I can see, is the lack of close parking.  The Salmon BLT was perfect, and went perfectly with my Hefeweizen, even though the menu didn't pair the two.  I will return to indulge again.  My buddy's Chicken Beer Sandwich was a game changer due to their fresh baked beer bread, which was kind of like a soft thin focaccia.  The sandwich was served 'wrap' style.  His order came with beer battered fries, and they were great.  They only have fresh lemons to squeeze into your Hefe, so you'll have to bring your own oranges.  And remember... pulp can move, baby!

The lunch bunch convened on this vegan hotspot to see and be seen... and to try out the bowls.  Imagine my surprise when Linh bucked the system and ordered a vegan bbbq burger with mock bacon.  Had I known that seven minutes later, I would staring longingly at his entree, with his highfalutin thyme fries being the object of my desire, I would have surely placed my order for "ditto" instead of the "diablo red bowl".  Pretty sure J-WoW and her "coconut curry bowl" shared in that sentiment.  The fries are wonderful.  Very thin and crispy, they were reminiscent of succulent pomme frites one might find in a culinary school's student restaurant.  Les frites étaient affirmation de la vie!  Oui oui, hon hon!  Knowing Linh won the entree lottery, I put a little more thought into the tSoynami frozen dessert, but that didnt keep Joycie's PB&J treat from walking away with the win, and Linh's Almond Joy non-dairy coming in a close second.  As she took her victory lap, I mused "sometimes you feel like a culinary looser, sometimes you dont".  I'm prepared to dominate on my next foray, because I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!

I'm never in the area (or hood, as I like to call it), so when I was in the hood (or barrio, as I like to call it), I was well aware of the consequences of wasting the opportunity to hit the Barrio.  Driving past the front door, which faces 16th St, I concluded parking must be in the back... which there was... just none for me... so I settled on the questionable lot on the north side of Edgemont... you know, where they filmed The Warriors?  It's ok, I'm totes insured.  So, I fabricate my best hardened criminal scowl, gangsta-strolled up to the front door, lean like a cholo, and announce that I require accommodations for uno.  That's Mexican for solo.  The hostess looks me up and down, and that's when I remembered I was wearing my Disneyland Resort shirt with the adorable Mickey Mouse arm patch.  Son-of-a-nutcracker!  Luckily, I got the best seat in the house, right at the end of the bar by the entrance, where no less than 47 people came to order their drinks while waiting to be seated.  This is the first "Mexican" restaurant where I was served a sliced french loaf and tapenade.  I started out with the Esquites, which is a delectable myriad of buttered roasted corn, chipotle cream, cotija cheese with cilantro and lime, served in a petite martini glass.  YES, this is the way a civilized person enjoys elote.  For the main course, I decided on Chile Colorado, which is a grilled bone-in pork chop smothered in a dark chile and red wine reduction, paired with a spicy mashed potato and grilled zucchini (half of which were cooked perfectly)  Since I was in such a high-profile seat, I thought I'd treat the clientele to a big boy eating a massive dessert, with my very large plate of dos churros floating atop a lake of caramel near a glacier of vanilla bean ice cream.  It was a winter wonderland on my plate.  Four people could have comfortably split this, but I was there to give the performance of a lifetime, and somewhere during Act 3, I spoon-fed the last morsel into the black hole perched precariously above my chin.  In today's match-up... MAN WINS!  I love people, and my bar-stool accommodations allowed me to chat with a seemingly never-ending stream of patrons.  I was walking people through the menu, suggesting specific pre-dinner drinks (lowrider) and regaling them with my quips. My big hit of the evening seemed to be "Wow, it appears y'all missed the happy hour pricing".  That one killed them all... especially the young couple who was charged $27.23 for 2 Modelos and 2 lime flavored tequila shots.  Barrio Cafe is spendy.  The entree was overpriced, but the appetizer and dessert were well worth the fare.  Sure, my tab could have fed a village in Sri Lanka for a month, but I don't know anyone there.

Everyone is raving about Mystere, but I'd say it was the 2nd greatest show I saw while in Vegas.    The top billing goes to my drunk-ass, baby-huey friend, who was bumpin uglies with a new acquaintance, somewhere in the parking garage.  I'm pretty sure I saw a 'diamond plate' imprint on her booty cheeks.  Now to be fair, Mystere was the only show that I could actually let my 11 year old daughter watch.  ~Swoop

How often do you come across a real treasure?  Once every couple of years?  Well, the Chandler AZ treasure of 2007 is Lee's Sandwiches, and I wish them much success.  Why I Give Mad Props to Lee's Sandwiches: 1. They have outdoor seating with mist-ers to keep customers cool, even at 110 degrees. 2. Add a statuesque actor in trademark John Wayne Gasey white makeup & a gondola canal inside, and you'd have the Venetian.  Then again, maybe not, but there is a mini concave rotunda built into the ceiling, painted with the colors of the wind. 3. They have a baguette factory.  Watch stainless steel machinery crank out French style loaves, while you and your chums enjoy an affordable meal in the dining area. 4. Eighteen different flavors of gelato. 5. They have a Deli Manjoo cream cake counter, with colorful carrying cases for to-go orders. 6. Fresh bread, fresh whole cilantro and thinly sliced fresh jalapenos joined forces to awaken sleepy taste buds. 7. The stylish Lance Armstrong style rubber bracelet which was affixed to each sandwich to keep the wrapper on tight.  Okay, it was just a sixteenth of an inch wide and only came in white.  What do you all want for nothing?  A rubber biscuit? 8. The low low prices. 9. My meal provided me with a front row seat to the putrid-pudding-stampede, at no additional cost.  Why I Put Lee's Sandwiches on Blast: 1. They don't take plastic... but they do have a shifty looking ATM against the wall. 2. The sweetly pickled julienned carrot sticks which were strategically placed on my meatball and bbq pork subs.  I didn't find the extra crunch to be an appealing augmentation. 3.  Some of the aromas emitted from behind the counter were not altogether inviting.  Finally, I found the cashier to be very friendly.  When I walked in with only a Hamilton, and the bill came to $10.11, guess who covered my shortage?  That's right, Nicole the benevolent cashier.  ~Swoop

I've seen fire and I've seen rain.  I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end. - The Original JT  Personally, I've never seen fire on this trail, but I have seen rain... and boy, does that make it slippery.  This is a fabulous trail, and is what I used to train for Flatiron, for a good 6 months.  i can ascend to the peak on this trail in about 40 minutes.  It took over two hours to hit the peak at Flatiron.  My buddy Nick, and I, hiked this trail today... http://youtu.be/l-aMaDoDRVE.  Let me explain the journey in words, and then you can watch the movie.  The start of the trail is a winding path, with a steep grade.  If I had to guess, it would probably be 15% for most of it, exceeding 20% in some parts.  This section culminates in a easterly view of the valley, complete with sunrise if you get out early enough.  it is followed by a brief reprieve, which then leads to the StairMaster portion, which is two distinct flights of railroad ties, some spaced a little too far apart.  This brings you to the first beast you'll face.  It's a smooth, almost vertical, incline, with two sets of handrails, which are critical for descending.  You should be out of breath by the time you clear this one.  However, I've seen people faint, and go down near the top.  Dont do that, because no one wants to see you "rag doll" it all the way down, and they sure dont want to baby sit you until rescue shows up.  Next is a short break until you hit the first of the rock piles.  Thankfully, this one does have a handrail, but it is the last handrail of the ascent.  Once past this, you'll be able to catch your breath, until you hit the next of the rock piles.  That one isnt bad, and I'm saying this because the next rock pile is bad... like really bad... like 5 or 6 of this one.  Between this one, and the next, is another break, and a short incline, where you wind around the side of the hill, take a big step up, and wind around a little more.  Now you're face to face with the "big boy", but you dont know that, because you cant see all of it yet... so wipe that smile off of your face... or better yet, eat a banana, because you're going to need some fuel for this next part.  Like a crock pot, just take it low and slow.  You'll climb and climb and then climb some more, and you will clear this part... but you'll never forget how relentless it was, because you'll have to go back down it.  From here, the summit is like five minutes away, as you scramble over more rocks, and up one slippery incline.  Before you know it, you hear voices and laughter.  You're mere seconds away now... and then you're there.  Enjoy the view my friend, and rest up, because you've got to go back down... unless you want to do an up-and-over to the Cholla side, and then come back over again.  It's like hiking the mountain twice.

There is a magic hour for BBQ, and if you happen to show up during that time, you will be wowed and amazed with delicious and moist sliced Texas brisket.  Some times the product is absolutely better than others.  I went around 5pm yesterday, and it was sheer perfection.  The Texas brisket plate comes with sliced brisket atop a slice of white bread, 2 sides of your choosing, and a corn muffin which I am not fond of.  zTejas makes my favorite corn bread, served in a skillet with sweet butter.  The sides I like are cob corn and grilled pineapple steaks.  The broccoli is pretty good too, as is the wilbur beans, which have scraps of brisket in them (not vegetarian)  I've tried one of the desserts, their Dave's Famous Bread Pudding, and it is spectacular, with a praline sauce pecans beg to float in, golden raisins, an oversized mound of sweet whipped cream and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.  If you want to get this $6.49 dessert for free, simply take the survey on your receipt, write down the code, and bring it back with you on your return visit.

Came here on a whim, and fell in love with the place.  Our server Raymond was super friendly and commented repeatedly on how they Love Yelp here.  Hey Gabi, this would be a great place for an official Elite Event, and they have an attached nightclub!  On to the food.  Ray suggested the Q-Rolls appetizer, and it didn't disappoint.  They're like flautas made with brisket, accompanied by two dipping sauces.  Simply Amazing!  Ray also recommended the whole hog entree with brisket, pulled-pork and baby backs.  It was large enough for my wife and I to share.  Delicious and filling.  My daughter ordered the half chicken plate, and their fries are superb.  We finished it off with a peach cobbler, and to our surprise, we were presented with a bag of Thank-Q's (accompanying our check), which were freshly made dough balls coated in cinnamon & sugar.  Very good!  If we lived closer, we'd be a fixture in this place.

I was already hurting by the time I started up this beast, knowing it was going to be the longest 2.4 miles of the day.  I was right.  The summit was great, but going down was pure pain.  My knees were already shot from the previous three mountains I had hiked that morning.    I did get to see a Police/Fire helicopter circle numerous times overhead, and ended up passing its target on the way down.  A few hundred yards later, I passed his rescuers coming up with a basket.  At that point, I wished for my own set of pallbearers to whisk me down to my waiting vehicle.  Total time up and back was 02:11:05.  This was my last of four mountains, one Saturday in April.  Check out my video of a later hike: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o27LEKc8g6s

This is a hidden jewel for sure.  I took my wife on a surprise outing this morning, as a friend of mine who volunteers here told me about it.  The $5 admission price gets you a slice of peace and tranquility.  Spend the morning walking around the large koi pond, which contains some of the biggest and most colorful fish I've had the pleasure of gazing upon.  I was told that on the 2nd Saturday of each month, they host an authentic tea ceremony, back in the tea gardens.  The general public is not allowed in that area without a 'docent', which is kind of a tour guide.  You should call to make a reservation if you wish to attend.  The current per person price is $25.  If you are looking for some quiet volunteer work, they will allow you to come down and lend a hand.  Not sure if you need to make arrangements first.  Is this a Japanese Garden, or a Japanese Style Garden?  I suggest you take up that conversation with volunteer Fred.

Yowga-ga-boing!  Excellent variety of signature burger combinations.  In particular, the one I tried (Desert Heat) was a taste sensation.  You don't find too many places offering both Angus and Kobe.  The buns were higher quality than your average burger stand fare.  The produce was nice and fresh.  Crisp lettuce, and the tomato was deep red, not that wilted yellow disc you sometimes get with the other guys.  Their beer battered onion-rings were perfectly crunchy and great tasting.  The fries tasted great, although they could have been a little more crisp.  Great selection of sodas (including Jones brand), energy drinks, and a unique variety of beers & wine coolers/malt beverages.  Trendy and clean upbeat environment.  Friendly staff.  The hostess was a cutie.  The grill guys paid attention to our order (I actually received a medium-rare patty).  The manager even came out and greeted us.  Maybe I was there on a good night, but you can bet I'll be back soon to try that seared Ahi burger.  In-n-out is good, but not even close to this good.  ~Swoop

It doesn't really feel fair to give Amazing Jake's 4 stars, because there are really two experiences going on within those walls.  You've got the culinary struggle, and then the action from all the games/rides.  Based on food alone, they'd get a generous 2 stars, with the only saving grace being their limited salad bar.  All of the other pabulum aint fab-u-lum.  They should could call it "ween cuisine", cuz all it takes is one time Cuz, and you wont be back no mowww (what you say!).  Mushroom fettuccine sounds delightful, until you get a punch from whatever that whacky-ass oyster essence is.  The pizza was a train wreck... a train wreck with fatalities... that spilled like 1000 gallons of ammonia, which threatens to asphyxiate the nearest small town.  Man, go to Cici's buffet.  See what those playas bring to the table for $5, and then try to replicate.  Better yet, take $100 from the till and hit the nearest Little Caesars.  Daaaang!  The dessert case proudly boasts "Freshly Baked"... what you don't know, is what month it was freshly baked, cuz Money, it wadn't today.  And I know the difference between ice cream, frozen yogurt, and frickin ice milk.  Ya hoodwinked me, G!    But in the eyes of a 4yo, this place is almost as fun as Disneyland.  She was sooo excited to go on all of the rides, so if you've got a little adrenaline junkie too, the mini coaster will hold the pinnacle of thrills.  And one word of advice.  When you're leaving, and you see that free photo kiosk hanging on the wall, where you can email the photo to yourself... the touch screen is way out of calibration.  Check the email address twice before you hit send.  Even after checking it, you still may not get your portrait sent to you... and that makes daddy sad.

08/13/07 UPDATE: They have the best, most crisp, french fries around.  And you can now watch music videos on their big plasma screen, from the Arabia channel. ===========================================  Opa!  I'm speaking Greek, right?  I write this review as a Caucasian male whose only familiarity with Mediterranean cuisine was when I ingested a leaf while eating grapes.  Turns out the leaf ended up being from a tomato vine.  I'm still wondering how that wilted foliage found its way into my cluster of concords.  Back to Phoenicia.  My first time there, I orderd the safest thing I could find... gyro and fries.  Roasted lamb and cucumber yogurt sauce.  It was like my mouth was having a party, and everyone was invited.  But wait, it gets better.  I see they have babaganoosh, and momentarily, I flash back to the Wedding Crashers movie.  Great, now I have to order it... and I'm glad I did.  Its just eggplant, people.  On subsequent visits, I ordered the chicken shawarma and kabobs, cilantro jalapeo hummus, tatziki.  Fantastic.  There is also a great place in Tempe called Haji-Baba.  Phoenicia also has a huge mural on the wall, of a Greek coastal setting, which you can stare at while you fill up.  For some reason, I keep reminding myself to wait an hour before going into the water.  This place is a real treat.  And their treats (desserts) and great too.  I'll take the pistachio baklava.  -Swoop

I wanted to love this restaurant, I really did.  The outside patio looks like a place I'd like to be at.  But the food is mediocre at best.  I had the carnitas chimichanga, and it was just ok.  The chips and salsa were good, but chips & salsa do not a meal make.  Wont be back, and I really wanted to kick it on the patio.

While looking for a lunch place in Mesa on Yelp, I came across Dooby's.  So I met my wife there.  They could have used someone with an eye for design, as the decor could be classified as thrift-store-restaurant-chic.  We started out with a hummus appetizer, which also came with kalamata olives, salted pickles, pepperchinis and shug (which is something new I've never had, a mixture of olive oil, cilantro, garlic and chili flake ground together).  The shug was fabulous!  The hummus was tasty, albeit a little chunky.  I prefer a smoother puree.  My wife ordered the shwarma/gyro combo, while I went with the shwarma plate with 2 side falafel.  The lunch combos came with an Israeli salad, which never arrived at our table.  Hmmm.  My wife found the chicken shwarma and gyro meat to be overcooked and dry.  She also though either the chicken or the mayo-based garlic sauce drizzled over it tasted funny.  I got used to the garlic sauce after a couple of bites, and cleaned my plate.  The falafel looked almost like little muffins, and were pretty good.  We ordered the baklava.  How to describe it in one word?  Dry.  They must have found this bad boy in the Gobi Desert.  Baklava is supposed to be moist with a honey simple syrup, which they must have been short of.  I had to temper my first reaction, which was to call out the kitchen staff and have each of them take a bite while berating them, a-la Gordon Ramsey.  I love that Hell's Kitchen.  The owner visited our table, and was very welcoming, very friendly.  However, I just cannot recommend this establishment with so many other great Mediterranean restaurants out there, such as Phoenicia Grill and Haji-Baba.

Yes, I agree with the other reviews.  Incredible hike, especially if you continue up to Flatiron.  The waterfall was dry, and I bet its fantastic when its flowing.  If you make it to Flatiron and back, go ahead and pat yourself on the back for making the 5.8 mile trip.  I'd suggest hiking in a group.  You'll park in the Lost Dutchman State Park.  There is a $5 day use fee per vehicle.

As far as I'm concerned, Chef Eric nailed it with his Thai Basil Chicken entree.  Also love their thai coconut curry, pad thai, dan dan and kung pao.  The staff here is usually friendly and accurate, with no botched orders yet.  Sure the dining area can get loud, but I come here with co-workers all the time, and it hasn't yet drown out any of our conversations.  Fresh orange wedges for your fresh brewed iced tea.

Come on guys.  You can do better than this.  The Van Buren location does.  We showed up around 6:30pm with Groupon in hand.  The place was dirty, the BBQ cauldron was nearly empty, and the cashier/waiter brought us spare ribs when we ordered baby backs... he brought us spare ribs twice... after I had to ask twice to get the baby backs we ordered.  Seriously???  We just left.

Typically, $20 for a pedicure is a real good deal.  Not here...  The bad: * Not enough staff (long wait time, and they get you in the chair so its more of a hassle to get up and leave) * Rush job (25 minute pedicure.  Thanks for the 2 minute massage) * Uneven cut on toenails * Use old polish (old polish takes forever to dry)  Don't waste your time or money here

I have a friend who is a big oaf.  One day, the oaf managed to get a .357 round lodged quite soundly in his handgun.  As I saw him head to the drawer full of hammers, I proposed that we take it to a local firearms dealer, since they must deal with this scenario often.  Lucky for us, ATF was conveniently located down the street.  The gentlemen behind the counter took a quick gander at the fastened firearm, and then headed for their drawer full of hammers.  Using a piece of wood dowel, they dislodged the shell without a series of unfortunate events unfolding.  The charge for this service?  A hearty handshake.  So, we visited for a spell and found out about their CCW class, which led into a big discussion regarding their Machine Gun Safari.  This sure wasn't the kind of colloquy that liberal bedtime stories are made of.  As soon as I get the time, I'm rounding up a few acquaintances and heading to ATF for a day of male bonding and firepower.  In other news... I can see where the ATF Girls could be offensive to some, like Misty, whose point of view is completely valid.  Personally speaking, I have a penchant for girls in tight shirts, breasts peeking out the bottoms, all holding guns and posing for the camera with a come-hither look.  As Jim Carrey would say (in Dumb & Dumber), " I like it a-laht ".  But not to worry, I'm seeing a therapist twice a week.  ~Swoop

"What's that smell?", my daughter asked as she wrinkled her nose. "That, my dear, is the scent of government assistance"  Hey, I'm no snob (but it's rumored that I'm a jackass), and Golden Corral really does offer unlimited ribs... but I don't see the benefit in having unlimited ribs when you don't care for the taste or consistency of them.  It's cheap food, and a lot of it, but I'm not a pig (although I do have my times), and I don't want to feed from a trough.

I attended Michael C's Ubuntu release party (I may have arrived a little early) with my Dell Dimension 2400, and I'm not sure which one of us had the better time.  Upon entering Red Seven, I noticed a long table full of fruit and veggie trays, appetizers, snacks and desserts.  In a corner of the store was an actual bartender who was ready to serve up cocktails, beer, wine or soft drinks.  Michael greeted me promptly, directed me to a spot where I could rest my computer, and invited me to have a drink and look around while the install technician was finalizing his preparations for the evening's event.  That's when I noticed the low prices of their computers.  The first system I came across was $250, with others dipping below the two hundred mark.  When I initially walked in, Michael was with a customer, so I listened in to their conversation as I browsed.  Michael seems like the kind of knowledgeable salesman who doesn't just want to make a sale, but wants to make a fit.  When the install area was ready, Chris came out to the store floor, and Michael introduced me to him.  Chris carried my mini-tower to the technician area, with me in tow.  We chatted for a bit as he removed the side panel and looked inside, where he found some of my handiwork (a secondary hard drive hanging by the ribbon).  Immediately, he went into a bin and retrieved a hard drive housing, and secured my hardware.  Chris is a very personable guy, who enjoys making music using his computer.  He even let me check out a few of his tracks when I asked about them.  Michael ordered several pizzas, so I indulged while watching masters of Ubuntu showcase the new product on two of Red Seven's floor models.  The place got pretty full, with several attendees being from a retirement community.  That's pretty cool.  An hour an a half later, the install was complete, and I now had several desktops available within a spinney cube.  If you go down to Red Seven, they can show you exactly what that means.  So you ask: What was the charge for this service?  Not a penny.  Because this was a release party, they provided this service free of charge, while providing the attention one would pay top dollar for.  Trustworthy, Knowledgeable, Personable, Affordable.  If these all sound like good traits to you, then check out Red Seven.

BLACK FRIDAY 2012 ROTD Baby!!!  If you like green chiles, they have bags of roasted ones at the checkout.  Pick one up and smell it.  What an amazing aroma.  Now buy it !!!  Because I don't want to come in and pick up a bag, knowing your nose germs (and who knows what else) are all over the outside of the bag.  They also consistently have great ripe avocados.  Wish I could say the same for Sprouts, who typically sells avocados that could break windows.  Stop by the juice counter and get a strawberries and cream, horchata, or possibly watermelon juice.  But the real reason I come here is twofold.  The first reason is the meat counter, which is where they keep the ranchera steak.  Oh yeah, have them add the marinade and let it sit overnight.  The second reason is the hot food counter.  Best refried beans I've had in a while.  While you're there, pick up a tub of their freshly made salsa, and some hot tortillas.

Firebirds is a solid place to have lunch with coworkers or friends, albeit a tad on the pricey side.  My service has never been poor, and often been exceptional.  And there are several menu items I rotate through, so they're far from a one trick pony.  Their Delmonico Steak Sandwich was delightful from the first bite.  Juicy with char grilled flavors that cascaded over my tongue, I found this to be a very satisfying lunch option, especially when paired with the sweet potato fries... and for $12, not a bad price.  When my Grilled Tenderloin Salad arrived at the table, it was visually underwhelming, lacking the creativity I've grown accustomed to with other restaurants.  Essentially lettuce and tomato with some bleu cheese crumbles, with a steak on top.  Thankfully I had the foresight to add egg, which didn't really jazz it up all that much.  However, once I took a bite of that steak, I was completely impressed... with the taste.  At $15.95, it is pricey, but the meat is worth it.  The Bleu Cheese Burger is a must try for anyone who can appreciate mushrooms and roquefort.  A delight for the senses, my friend.  For my side, I went all-out Napoleon Dynamite and had the tots.  They were perfectly crisp... almost too crisp.  This was a completely enjoyable entree regardless.  And if none of these options appeals to you, check out their menu, which is modestly diverse.

Rich was very helpful to us, from getting a floor model clearance fan down for us, to explaining how to install a remote kit, to answering questions on the new CFL bulbs and why they are not dimming (we purchased & installed the non-dimmable ones)  I find that the employees here are more friendly, on average, than employees at HD.

Wow, what a difference a remodel makes when it's done right. Major props to the design star who took this interior from shab to fab!  They now have a cafe which serves edibles such as gelato, sandwiches, baked goodies and coffee drinks.  When my wife and I came in to cash in on an ages-old credit slip, there was a vocalist/violinist and guitar player performing in front of the magazine rack. The singer was entrancing, which tempered my annoyance to the fact that they were blocking access to the Guitar World issues I came to peruse.  The checkout and book buying areas look fantastic. It just feels right.

One of my staple dishes is the spicy tuna roll, and I love a place that can make it spicy, and tasty.  Yogi's is such a place.  I love what they do.  If I worked closer to the Fiesta Mall area, I'd be frequenting this place more often.  That's all I have to say about that.

I blew in here an hour before a Coyotes game, and really wasnt expecting much, based on some reviews of 'other' Westgate restaurants.  Fortunately for me, I was pleasantly surprised.  The place was packed, but my friend and I were seated immediately at the sushi bar.  Our drink order was taken within a couple of minutes.  I ordered 2 sets of the spicy yellowtail rolls, since that's my thang.  They came up quick, and they looked great... but that was nothing compared to their taste.  Probably one of the most spiciest spicy yellowtail rolls I've ever had.  A single tear of joy rolled off my cheek.  I offered one to my companion, who asserted that his sushi hymen was indeed intact.  After trying it, he blurted out complements regarding the bite sized treat... so I offered another.  But that's where my hospitality ended.  These were so good, that I bogarted 10 of the 12 rolls.  I'm not sure if the quintuplets were waiting tables that night, but I couldnt discern which waitress was ours, so I reached out to the nearest one and requested our check.  And then we were gone...  Sure beat the hell out of the pedestrian cuisine a la Jobbing.com Arena.  And, I ended up paying less.

A reliable business associate referred me to Chris at Stellar.  So, I gave him a call.  He suggested that I buy my own opener if I wanted to save some cash.  He even recommended a brand.  He came out to my house the next day (on time) and completed the installation of a new Chamberlain opener that I bought from the Depot.  After he finished, he cleaned up, and walked me through all of the features, taking the time to program my external access box.  Since his price was very reasonable, I had him replace the steel rollers with teflon ones, which really cut down on the noise.  He even lubricated the spring action.  Promises made, promises kept.  I highly recommend. http://www.stellargaragedoor.com/

In case you're wondering, my favorite sales associate, Samantha, works here at Performance.  And if you ask her, she'd say that I'm her favorite customer (unless she's just patronizing me).  I've been here on many occasions, and am always greeted upon entering the premises.  I purchased one of their bikes (Scattante is their brand name) during a huge sale, and walked away with a rather nice deal.  Another great bonus is the Performance club, where you get 10% back on anything you buy, towards store merchandise.  They have a great selection of biking shoes, including my current favorite brand: Sidi.  These shoes fit like a glove, but that's probably because they are crafted from fine Italian leather.  And they stand by their product.  I returned a defective headlight, and Nate (whose face recently became acquainted with a mountain trail) traded me up to a better item at no charge.  And if you happen to catch Glenn, ask to see his urban assault bike.  Very impressive and not for the faint of heart.

Exotic aromas teased my palate upon entry.  The dining area was bustling, but the one waitress (who also served as hostess, cashier and table busser) operated most efficiently.  The lunch special prices are agreeable, even to the most penny-pinching niggard in your party, at under $7, and come with soup, an egg roll and a couple of fried won-tons.  Their phad thai portion was about twice the size of their curry specials.  This place gets busy around 12:30, so be sure to arrive before 12:15, or stroll in after 12:45.  I watched heartbroken as a strikingly tall blond, sporting intriguing body art, turned and walked out the door once she realized there were no open tables.  My outward demeanor was sullen, while inside I was screaming: "You maniacs!  You blew it!  Damn you!  Damn you all to hell!", as I pounded the table with my fists.  Great food, but can get a little loud.  I highly recommend Thai Rama, even if you have to endure the grating vocal stylings of an insecure nit-wit who feels compelled to laugh at every insignificant comment uttered from those dirty apes she strolled in with.

This is the first establishment I've patronized solely based on Yelp reviews.  I was not disappointed.  Even though the $3.33 specials were plastered near the front door, I opted to order off of the wall.  My wife ordered the Mongollian Beef and I ordered some kind of fried noodle dish with pork.  The prices were VERY reasonable, and the dishes were authentic.  Don't let the interior aesthetics scare you away.  Its very clean, and they serve very fresh food.

RATING: NEGATIVE STARS!!!  I know it's an overused adage, but this place licks the sweat off of a dead donkey's balls!  Don't believe the hype, the TV commercials are a sham!  And most importantly, do NOT darken their door unless you have time and gas money to waste.  Liquidation?  What the hell are they liquidating, my wallet?  Oh Yeaaah!  Two couches for $3000?  This is the same stuff you can find at Ashley or Mor, where their regular prices are less than AHF's advertised 'going out of business' price.  Shame, Shame on you American Home Furnishings.  You wouldn't know bankruptcy liquidation pricing if it licked the sweat off your dead donkey's balls!

So I got 3 flat tires in my first 8 days of riding my bike to work.  Yes, it's extremely annoying.  Thanks for asking.  After posting a plea of help to my fellow Yelp biker Tim, he suggested I get the Kevlar tires he uses.  I called around to locate a bike store along my route home.  Luckily for me, Global Bikes carried these tires, and they were in the direction I was headed.  They hooked me up with 2 new armadillo elite (flat resistant) tires, and performed the tire replacement for a mere $6.  I walked into Global Bikes a boy, but left a man.  Thanks guys!  I look forward to many moons without a deflated tire.

Well, the phrase: "it was worse than a root canal" is about to take on a whole new meaning, thanks to Dr Madder and his wonderful staff.  No, I'm not masochistic.  I don't even like flossing, because it stings my gums.  These guys (mostly women) are that good.  Let's start with the reception area.  When I walked in the front door, I was immediately greeted by a beaming Tish, who warmly welcomed me in.  She is hot, and has perfect teeth.  Go ahead; try to find a flaw with those beauties.  Tish also has a sick sense of humor.  She proved that by laughing at some of the comedic remarks I penned on my new patient form.  When my time had come, Cherie escorted me back to my recliner... the recliner I was destined to spend close to 4 hours in.  Yes, this was no mere mortals visit to the dentist.  This was to be one of the greatest marathon sessions the world had ever known.  And Cherie made the time fly by.  She was attractive, witty, funny, charming, and not afraid to get down and sing to George Michael's version of Last Christmas.  Looks like somebody has a new admirer!  Are you needing a cleaning?  Then Aimie will do the honors; and she rounds out our trio of beauties.  I don't know how she does it, but she makes me feel completely at ease, and she's got some pretty good stories.  Ask about the Starbucks/Trader Joes incident.  And guess what?  She called to check up and see how I was feeling after my deep cleaning.  Then there was Dr Madder... a handsome young man of GQ'ish stature.  I felt like I was on the set of Melrose Place.  The Dr was skilled in the art of injections.  Had I been as accomplished with a hypodermic, I'd probably be "chasing the dragon" today.  I really appreciated how he would tell me what to expect, before doing something.  No Surprises!  That's my motto.  My root canal was virtually pain free.  It went very smooth, and I couldn't have been happier.  I left with a numb tongue and an unrequited crush.  But I will return, my friends.  I will indeed return... to get my six month cleaning... and my crowns (king me baby).  {04/29/08 Update} Sad news, Cherie no longer works here.  :-{

I've run the gamut on onion rings... from two days ago experiencing the worst at Pete's, to today experiencing the best at Joe's.  These people were on their A-game tonight. The pulled pork & baby backs had such a flavorful smokey essence, while the chicken strips were an amazing taste combination between chicken parm and BBQ sauce.  Did I mention they have the best onion rings ever?  A great example of a restaurant that doesn't skimp, rather display an eye for detail. It takes more prep time, but it's worth it, and it shows.  The shrimp basket was very good, and the homemade cocktail sauce was the crowning jewel.  What's better than a surry with a fringe on top?  Howz about a hot dog with an egg on top.  Delectable!

This place is a gem, and their pristine outside patio is perfect for morning lattes when there is a scent of chill in the air.  The wife and I popped in based on an article she had seen.  I know the following statement has no business being in a business review, but the cashier had the bluest eyes I've ever seen, and it took everything in me to refrain from asking if they were real.  The Lemon Whoopi was a great little cream-filled, sponge cake cookie.  But the real shining star was the Cinnamon Cupcake.  Amazing concentrations of cinnamon sugar were dispersed throughout the cupcake, delighting me bite after bite.  The frosting was creamy, with a little crust of sugar, adding to the consistency.  It was simply wonderful.  I simply must try to recreate this award winning pastry.  So Joe, if you're reading this, we can do it the easy way, or the hard way.  You could bestow the recipe for this little treasure, and I could sign an NDA, and it would be our little secret.    OR... I could assemble the greatest axis of cupcake aficionados this side of... um, a place that would be notorious for cupcakes?  Then, after purchasing hundreds of these treats, and returning most of them to my team for careful analysis, could come up with the same recipe.  The ball is in your court Joe, but be forewarned: I wont wait forever before soliciting my hench-women.  PS: Applications now being accepted for cupcake hench-women.

The last time I snacked on their traditional peanuts in a galvanized bucket was when I lived east of the Mississippi, in the volunteer state.  The year was 1995.  I was the fat guy with the receding hairline who always found the table to be positioned a little too close to the booth seat.    No matter.  I'd gladly wedge myself in on a Friday or Saturday evening, in anticipation of my weekly hand-cut steak & potato jubilee.  When I finally came to the realization that gorging myself on succulent bar-be-que wasn't providing me with a lasting happiness, I tried the salads.  I started out with the Fried Chicken Salad, but quickly graduated to the Roadhouse Steak Salad.  If you're pretending to watch your weight, like I am... might I suggest this manly concoction of mixed greens, egg and tender juicy beef.  OK, so maybe you're not "down" with the garden harvest.  If you really want to try something mind-blowing, I dare you to open your mouth wide, and tell your server that Swoopy sent you, and you want the Santa Fe Tilapia, 'tout-suite'  {culture alert: 'tout suite' is a French term meaning 'at once'}.  Q. What is tilapia, you ask? A. Short answer: a non-tetrapod chordate... aquatic vertebrate... a fish.  I know, I know.  I usually don't order fish in a steakhouse, but you need to free your mind.  Throw away your preconceived notions.  This isn't "Preconceived Notion Roadhouse"... its "Logan's Roadhouse"!!!  And this dish is unique and very tasty.  ~Swoop

I thought this would be an easy kill.  I was already perturbed at their sales staff for standing me up on a previous appointment... so when the 'free week' coupon came in the mail, I foresaw my Yelpers revenge, for my mission was to scribe their demise, at their hand.  -Day 1- It was a sweltering August Sunday afternoon.  A slight breeze blew as I walked across the parking lot towards the reception desk.  Every few steps, a wisp of chlorine from the outdoor pool would reach me.  The absence of smiles from the faces of each exiting member told me that I was about to be part of something special.  The associate at the front desk invited me to peruse the complex in return for my signature.  I looked up from my autograph session to behold a large plasma TV serving up music videos.  As I walked into the mouth of the beast, one word came to mind... conglomerate.  Yes, this was a Herculean aggregation of raw fitness potential.  Passing by several vacant mini-meeting rooms, I pondered the sheer number of financial obligations which had been entered into.  The men's dressing room left me in awe.  I beheld cherry wood lockers and granite countertops.  Surely these are materials which doctors and lawyers would afford in their grand country clubs.  Oh my, I see a chorus line of fancy chrome plated hair dryers.  Good lord, the bathrooms are sealed off.  No longer would I have to be subject to the smells and sounds of hunkered patrons working through their 'man-cramps' (aka: stewing chamber pot chili).  Their aquatic offering was subdivided into an indoor and an outdoor water park.  A 5 lane lap pool, Olympic pool with 2 water slides, 2 jacuzzis and a sauna comprised the indoor kingdom, while a 4 lane lap pool, huge swimming/playing pool with 2 slides and a mushroom constituted the outdoor funfair.  Yay!  They had the obligatory bleach blonde lifeguard.  Schwing!  [gyrate hips forward]  A misting system provides a cooler climate for heat conscious loungers, and an on-site snack bar offered wrap and salad alternatives to the commonplace fare.  The outdoor area was clamoring with harmonies (screaming kids) typical of a public pool.  The 2nd floor of the facility is reserved for the rows of workout machines.  There are no less than 23 giant video screens built into the walls.  OK Lifetime Fitness, you win round one.  But there are so many other levels which you can fail at, and six days to do it.  ~Swoop   Update 07/28/2008:  OK, I cant be hating any more.  I love this place and became a member after they threw some cool perks my way.  You wanna try something new?  Check out the class with the pilates machine.

This review is particular to the 'Block Party' that Whole Foods puts on.  I was invited by Yelp's own Ivonne B, who ended up being my block party tour guide.  She took us on a tour of the store, stopping at several locations for a tasting sample.  I've never had grilled pineapple before, and it was such a treat.  It was also my first time for Indian Candy.  Ivonne is a spitfire, and made our time spent there enjoyable and entertaining... because she has a real passion for food and nutrition.  Sure, I love Whole Foods as much as the next person, but the 'Block Party' proved to be the consummation of our love.  And Ivonne let me in on a little Whole Foods customer secret... which if it got into the wrong hands, could be abused.  I'll let you inquire directly from her.

This is a 5 mile roundtrip which crosses some desert, and then up a road to some antennas and satellite dishes.  It's a pretty easy hike, just annoyingly uphill for what seems to be a long ass time.  Took a couple of wrong turns on the way back.  Try to remember where you came from.  Total time up and back was 01:31:11.  This was my second of four mountains, one Saturday in April.

If it wasn't for my eating disorder, I would have walked out.  Instead of making that smart choice, I stayed... cutting away at the thick layer of breading in search of the two haddock fillets.  My rescue attempt turned out to be a recovery, as it tasted fishy.  The fries were exceptional, and my wife commented that the cole slaw could be one of the best she has ever tasted. But a great supporting cast isn't going to be enough to redeem the unappetizing star of this show.  I'll go to Long John Silvers long before I'll set foot in here again.

First of all, I just want to say THANK YOU to Benihanas.  I signed up for their birthday club, and received a voucher for $30 towards a birthday meal.  That's pretty huge, and I'm very grateful.  But I have to calls em like I sees em.  Let's start at the beginning.  The salad had a bit too much dressing on it.  Check out my photo of what was left at the bottom of my salad bowl and see for yourself.  I think the folks over at The Sushi Room have got a good grasp on salad dressing.  The caterpillar and spicy tuna rolls were fantastic tasting and a good size.  This would be a great place for HH.  I came here with my daughter.  We both wanted Chicken Yakisoba.  She ordered off of the lunch menu (around $8), and I ordered off the dinner menu (around $18) since I had the $30 credit.  Imaging my surprise when the waitress brought out two places of equal portions.  Where did the extra $10 go?  Oh yes, I did get a soup with my entree.  Their yakisoba was just ok.  The chicken was a bit dry and the noodles had a taste I was not accustomed to.  Not terrible, but not a dish I'll be returning for anytime soon.  When we were done, the waitress brought individually wrapped hand towels, something I would expect at a BBQ joint.  But Wow!!!  These hand towels are awesome.  So big and thick.  I wish Buffalo Wild Wings would give you these kind of hand towels, instead of the little thin ones that burn your hands and smell of lemon.  For dessert, a large scoop of green tea ice cream, and a fried banana with vanilla ice cream.  Both were excellent.  I would order these again.  And to top it off, the manager sauntered over to where we were seated and asked if we would like our picture taken.  I affirmed, and assumed a lean-over-the-table pose.  No more than two minutes later, he returned with a nicely framed picture of my birthday guests.  Superb!  100% impressed.  Once again, thank you Benihana for making an otherwise normal birthday meal, special.  I'll be back for HH and desserts.

What a great place to catch up with good friends.  Loved the atmosphere, and the food was good too.  Better if you have friends who will show up earlier than you do to get a table.  Best if you have friends who will pick up the whole tab.  I recommend the Chilaquiles and the 3 Eggs Steak/Chilli.  My wife doesn't recommend the Corned Beef Hash Plate.  Yeowch!  Merry Christmas everyone!

I absolutely love the New York Steamer sandwich, but when I went in today to place my order, I was distracted by the cashier inquiring about my adorable grand-daughter (who I was holding) and I guess I said Engineer instead of Steamer.  Imagine my disappointment when I peeled back the wrapper to reveal turkey and mushrooms instead of corned beef and pastrami.  Fighting back tears of defeat, I sunk my teeth into my tender regret.  You know, it was pretty good.  But next time I'll write down my order and just hand it to the cashier.

I remember my first imbibing (thanks to Lauren V for the word) of 80 proof peppermint schnapps.  It literally took my breath away for a few moments, finally leaving me with the minty aroma reminiscient in many a drunk tank, during the Christmas season.  I also remember my first experience with Johnny Rockets boneless buffalo wings.  It was last night, about an hour before the hockey game.  And much to my chagrin, they literally took my breath away for a few moments... it was nothing like that 1986 smash hit from Berlin on the Top Gun soundtrack.    Picture if you will, a plate of reconstituted Swanson chicken nuggets that you microwaved, and then forgot about on the counter for an hour because you had to go and satify a more immediate urge.  Then, being the alchemist that you are, imagine crafting an elixir of 40% hot sauce and 60% vinegar, which you pour onto the plate of stale nuggets (only after re-warming them in the microwave for 30 seconds), so that it forms a pool of pungent goodness.  If "Summer's Eve" made boneless buffalo wings, I would expect them to be just like the one's served at Johnny Rockets.  Yum.  It was like a crappy appetizer AND a douche.  On the plus side, my yeast infection seems to have all but cleared up.

Seven of us met for breakfast today, and I didn't hear one complaint from my party.  We showed up at 9:30 and were seated within 5 minutes.  I was a little hesitant, reading the negative reviews for this place, but left pleasantly surprised.  I'm not sure if they changed out their biscuits (based on previous reviews), but my friend who ordered them, complimented their biscuits and gravy.  I ordered the huevos rancheros with green chile, and loved it.  The dish came with rice, beans and hash browns.  Good job RHG!

Based on L'aura L's ROTD review, I hustled on down to AZ Mills (sans gat) with my daughter.  She had been talking about scoring some H.K. merchandise for her upcoming birthday, so the review was very timely for us.  The staff was gracious, bringing us a shopping basket, taking our big items & our Tilly's bag and (conveniently for us) storing them behind the cash register, so we could continue shopping uninhibited.  I kept making a move toward the checkout counter, which would cause one of the staff to shift over to the register, and then I would turn away towards another corner of the store.  I do enjoy the occasional game of salesperson cat & mouse.  When it came time to pay, I opted for one $1 ticket to 'the game', where my daughter walked away with the grand prize.  She loves her purchases, and we're hatching a H.K. egg in a cup of water.

Both my daughter and I got to spend a fun filled Sunday sick to our stomachs, retching, plus all the highlights that go along with it.  Interestingly enough, Saturday night, we both had bean and cheese burritos with guacamole here.  I'm not saying we got food poisoning from Filiberto's, but it is definitely suspect.

"I will crave this sandwich!"  Those were the first words uttered after my wife took a bite of the Kalamata, which was featured on the Food Network.  I ordered the Manzi panini, and thought it was good, my wife's sandwich was much better... and I'm not one who really cares for olives.  I adored the crisp olive oil chips which accompanied the sandwiches, as they were reminiscent of a kettle chip.  Their Meyer Lemon olive oil cake was a blast of summer flavor, which combined fresh blueberries and sliced strawberries with a powdered sugar sprinkle.  For such a small space, they really maximized the retail section/food counter/seating.  But the icing on the cake was found in their Hello Kitty branded champagne.  My daughter is a huge fan, and we bought a bottle to toast the arrival of our granddaughter next month.  I don't know nothing about birthing no babies, but I can appreciate a cute cartoon feline on my libation.

This may be the first review that I've awoken from a deep dream of peace to write.  Ok, first I had to make a pit stop, but then it was time to pen my thoughts and aspir... ooooh hoooold on, brb...  Now, where was I.  Here's a fun fact... the human body can hold up to a quarter of its own weight in disposable fluids, whose liberation can be mobilized by Arriba's own spinach enchiladas.  Ole!  That's right, the green leafy vegetable made famous by a marble-mouthed sailor, now compels me to blow my own ballast tanks... again and again  But I have to say, this couldn't have come at a better time, with tomorrow being the inaugurate outing of my office's hiking group.  Magic 8 Ball says "Signs point to yes" that I'll collapse 27 minutes into the trek from dehydration, and possibly require professional extrication.  You know what doesn't require professional extrication?  The cauldron of dysentery brewing in my lower GI.  Spiiiicy!  But to be fair, its not all waterloo, Arriba's.  I really should thank you for lightening my load, even though I've really never felt more bloated and irritated.  *quizzical look*  And if I ever nurture the desire to tarry in your cantina, which is somewhat reminiscent of The Blue Oyster on tango night, I'll be sure not to waste the opportunity, and schedule that pesky colonoscopy for the following morning.  Osmoprep's got nutin on you, honey.  Montezuma's revenge me once, shame on you.  Montezuma's revenge me twice... we wont get fooled again

I've been to the Mesa location, and had a high opinion before walking through the front door.  When I opened the front door, I wanted to be greeted with the smell of smoked meats, so strong it knocks me backwards. In this case, I was greeted with: "I'll be with you in a minute". Kind of a letdown.  Yeah, the great BBQ smell was AWOL.  Deciding on the Sampler entree, I received pork, brisket and a hot link.  Ouch, the brisket was dry.  Unfortunately, so was the pulled pork.  Is this Waldo's related to the Mesa Waldo's?  It just might be, because the hot link has good taste, good crispy crackle on the skin. It even has a little heat.  Their house BBQ sauce is great, but good BBQ should stand alone, the sauce is meant to compliment.  The cowboy beans were like a plain pinto, and didn't have a good smoked flavor. Most other places use the pan drippings and have bits of meat, which add flavor.  Hope you're paying attention to this, owner of this Gilbert Waldo's.  Their spicy fries were good seasoned french fries.  Should I have been surprised that their peach cobbler and apple crisp used canned fruit?  The presentation was adorable in tiny skillets. For $0.99, you can get you a little something sweet.  Will I be back?  Probably not.  There are too many other places I haven't tried.

You know what I look for in a Thai Restaurant?  Awkward social interactions.  Don't get me wrong, Thai House rocks!  From their musamum curry to their pad thai, they know their way around a wok, or whatever racially charged cooking implement they got going on back there.  I have great memories of TH, especially since this is where part of my GD interview occurred.  This review, however, ignores all former bliss, and attempts to regale the reader with details from one visit in particular.  2016.  That was my first year on the job.  Bad year for phishers, bad year for David Bowie, bad year for comb-overs... we had the US Govt telling Apple to provide a back door into their phones.  Listen, I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Gregorian Chant was never my bag.  But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into Thai House, fella.  As I sat and awaited the arrival of my curry dish, I grew bored of my phone.  I looked around to notice the other customers in the dining room, and quickly grew bored of them.  To  my right, a younger couple on a date, to my left, a Vato sitting alone with his noodle dish.  Shifting my focus now to Instagram, I didn't look up when I heard the bells on the door rattle, or when a shadow passed before me.  I didn't even budge when I heard conversation ensue at the table to my left.  But once I heard the familiar words "and I went an had an abortion because its what you wanted me to do, and now you're treating me like this?!?!", my ears perked up.  IG became hum drum in this new drama that was playing out on my southpaw, which grew more intense with each syllable.  Great lines ensued from the shadowy woman, such as: * Why are you treating me like this?  I'm saying I love you! * I asked you before I moved out here if you wanted to be with me! * You don't want me around?  But I want to live with my husband! * Stop disrespecting me!  Put your phone down when I'm talking to you! * I wasn't looking at my phone, I was just checking it!  Stop disrespecting me! * Are you saying you don't love me anymore?  I'm not poking fun at this late 20's couple, who clearly, could both stand for some marriage counseling... but choosing a quiet restaurant to host a relationship meltdown was a poor choice... as we all were drafted to become awkward audience members in a Springer'esque soap opera... except no one was chanting "Jerrrry Jerrrry"

Fantastic Thai Iced Tea Boba. LOVED IT!  I loved it so much that I'm currently plotting my next Pho Van boba acquisition.  And they are rumored to offer a pineapple boba drink.  Scandalous!  I got me one of them brisket and round eye pho's to go. When I finally arrived home and got to it, its taste was greatly enhanced by it's spicy broth. Other broth's may be bland, but you won't have to worry about those girlie broths here.  One of my favorite Pho's to date.  Great restaurant, great location (right by Lee Lee's), but these idiot drivers over here, drive with their heads firmly lodged up their asses.  Stereotype or a Reality?  You decide

I saw Toy Story 3D here, and the ticket price was cheaper than AZ Mills (I think because Gateway gave the matinee price for the 4;30 show).  However, the theater was smaller than the ones I've been to at AZ Mills.  I choose price over size.

"I'll take 1 adult, 1 child" @Disneyland = "That'll be $325.00" "I'll take 1 adult, 1 child" @IMAX = "That'll be $32.50" "I'll take 1 adult, 1 child" @Mesquite Groves = "That'll be $3.25"  Once that gigantic water bucket starts tipping over, you know summer has officially begun.  This is my favorite of the Chandler Aquatic Center pools, as it just has so many great things.  In addition to the massive pail that dumps thousands of gallons onto gleefully squealing children, there is a lazy river which floats you under a series of randomly spilled smaller buckets, a whirlpool where you and your little one can swirl, a spouting fun house with slides for the kids, wet tube slides and a splash pad.  The lockers are located inside the bathrooms, which keeps them nice and cool... and they're only a quarter... not $10 like some SoCal amusement parks... however, I do get some quizzical looks as I enter the women's' restroom, with locker key noticeably displayed in my right hand, to retrieve my belongings.  There is a little snack trailer on the premises, which peddles all the things you love which are void of any nutritional value.  Just today, I scored a hot dog, slice of pizza, bag of chips and an Italian ice... which ended up being the biggest purchase of the day at $7.50.  There are 3 shaded picnic benches there, but dont think you'll get to sit while you dine... because three families got there before you did, and are now roosting in that prime real estate.  This place does get crowded, but hey, they will always be on the receiving end of my $3.25

We ordered a cake for my daughter's baby shower, and provided them an invitation and some ribbon.  They did a fantastic job matching color and imagery... and the taste was great!  Yes, they are somewhat expensive, but the Wow-Factor they provide is well worth the price.

This is one market that rivals even Lee Lees.  Much like it, but cleaner and brighter.  Would you like to try some Durian?  They have it, both fresh and frozen.  Go ahead, take a whiff.  I know you want to.  A little cramped, but well worth the adventure.

It's no revelation that Pho Chandler has fantastic tasty Pho, and that its always packed when you go pick up your dinner Pho to-go.  What really bowled over my berries was their Pad Thai.  We've all had it somewhere.  I prefer Thai Dressing's version, or even Pei Wei's version to say Thai Rama's.  So I knows whats I likes...  The first thing that stood out to me, was the vermicelli noodles.  Much thinner than any other Thai place I've ordered from... and yes, I know this is a Vietnamese restaurant.  Maybe that's the difference... Viet Pad Thai uses angel hair.  I don't know, but I'm going with it.  While I momentarily considered it odd, I immediately found it an absolute delight.  And the prep work!  Yes, the prep work.  Everything was skillfully diced.  No chokey chicken pieces here, you know, the kind that are infamous for lodging in windpipes.  The taste was there.  The constancy was there.  I was there.  And if I have my way, I'll be there again tomorrow, ordering you know what.  Hey, why don't you meet me at Pho Chandler, and we'll satisfy that Pad Thai lover in you.

Really good atmosphere, and the staff was surprisingly cordial and welcoming.  One of the wait staff came over, while we were waiting for our table, and asked us if we wanted something from the bar.  We were seated shortly after having our drinks hand delivered.  We both ordered the ribeye entree, after hearing great reviews from a coworker.  The accompanying smashed potatoes were crispy on the outside, soft & tender on the inside. Perfectly salted and parmesaned (can you use cheese as an adjective?).  Big stalks of broccoli, buttered, but undercooked, almost raw.  Black & blue coleslaw was very good. If you like blue cheese then you'll love this. Looking forward to trying it on a pulled pork sandwich.  Their ribeye was bursting with flavor. Tender & juicy. NOT what you'd expect from a neighborhood sports grill. The flavor rivaled Houston's. I can't say enough good things about it. We ordered it medium-rare, more on the rare side.  The manager came to check on us twice.  Once when we had to return my wife's steak, as it was overcooked.  He was very accommodating and had the replacement out in record time.  With steak, sometimes this happens, but it is how you remedy the situation that makes for a great experience.  I highly recommend Blue 32.

It is mediocre at its finest.  Our server, Julius, was not cut out to be working with customers.  He reminded me of Kel Mitchell, from Nickelodeon's Kenan & Kel show.  Except, picture Kel, experiencing the terrors of tripping on pot.  Julius seemed way out of it, and exuded the enthusiasm of Ben Stein's character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  My wife asked to taste the chile verde, and he brought us diced green chiles.  They blew our heads off!  The food was just food.  Nothing special.  I wont be back.

L'habit ne fait pas le moine  I walked right by this place, as it shares the same storefront as Frazee Paint.  Don't let the curb appeal fool you.  Prenez votre cul à l'intérieur!!!  Walking in, the place reminded me of a French Bistro... and mind you... I've never even been to Denmark.  It had such a quaint feel that I simply had to sit down and order lunch.  Figuring the escargot (my car go, one sixty, swiftly) would be a little BIG'gy, the obvious choice was the Eiffel Tower (ET), comprised of: turkey, ham, bacon, Swiss cheese, tomato, avocado served on 3 (YES, THREE!  This is the NOTORIOUS B.I.G. MAC OF SANDWICHES) layers of sourdough bread $9.67 (tax incl)  Seriously, the ET was so tall, I couldn't fit my petite pie hole around it, even after unhinging my lower jaw... this sucker was a tall sandwich... which serenaded me, while draped in a blue wig       Eat me, ea-ea-eat me      I'll infect you with my avo and      Fill you with my bacon  And thanks to the Desert Ray's crepe debacle 0f 2016, I just knew I'd be trying CPFB&C's crepes... and they were unparalleled!    Two crepes w/fresh red berries sauce and scoop of french vanilla ice cream for $8.59 (tax incl) is my new guiltless pleasure, as some guy on Yahoo Answers touted that crepes are actually good for you

The Sampler with carnitas was a winner. Tender chunks of pork love.  Chicken en Rojo, chicken breast was a bit dry, but had a great sauce. I adored the half cob on a stick, sprinkled with a creamy white cheese.   The mashed potatoes with a ladle of queso was delightful. Hey, that's not green onion, its pablano with a slightly noticeable heat.  If you appreciate good service, ask for Amanda's station.

My wife and I decided to pop in, spur of the moment one night.  We've noticed the place many times, but since its wedged between a motel and a bar, really never made it a priority.  One of the first things you'll notice, is all of the celebrity photos which line the walls.  Legend has it that the owners were paparazzi in their previous lives, and these snapshots are their handiwork.  I can neither confirm nor deny this rumor.  You'll have to ask them for yourselves.  I've never been to Tommy Burger out in LA, but my wife has numerous times growing up.  We were told their chili burger was very similar, and my wife said it was right on the money.  I tried it, and LOVED it.  The chili was thick and creamy, which made it cling to the meat.  Jacquie (sp?) provided great customer service, and was welcoming and friendly.  They also offer hot dogs, hot sandwiches (like pastrami and french dip), and a handful of dessert options (shake, malt, float, funnel cake, cookie melt).  Wow, don't judge a restaurant by its location.  Not only do they have great burger fare, but their prices are pretty low.  They kept the menu small, offered fresh quality ingredients, which all adds up to a great burger joint.

Once I tried their steak, I knew I'd be going against the old adage: Don't go to an Italian restaurant for a steak.  Went on a Friday night.  Ordered a modified antipasti appetizer.  Was kind of surprised at the skimpy portions, for a $12 appetizer.  Good taste though.  Love the fried zucchini, as they were cut like french fries and battered.  The sirloin was tasty, although the Marsala was a bit scanty.  My daughter loved her Pollo Rosa Maria, but found the baked veggies to appear less than appetizing (although she appreciated the healthy cooking method).  My salmon had a great consistency and was flavorful, but had a smidge of a fishy taste.  The tiramisu had a strong rum flavor, and did not rank well against others I've had from different eateries.  Without alcohol, dinner, beverages and 1 dessert for 3 was close to $100 with tip.

So I'm going to this survival weekend outing in the mountains, and I need a few items.  After browsing several online stores, and seeing the prices, I did a local search on Yelp for surplus, and came across Freedom.  They are open until 5 on Saturdays, which is good, because I like an afternoon nap.  I rolled up with 30 minutes to spare, and start browsing the racks.  I dont know if it was my Disney Friends Forever shirt, or my unlaced running shoes, but a sales associate promptly came over to where I was shopping, and asked if she could help.  Well, she was a huge help, pointing me to the discounted BDUs, suggesting hiking boots, retrieving a wet weather poncho, and bringing me moisture wicking socks.  At the checkout counter, the checker inquired if I was planning on wearing the shirt I picked out with the Jacket I picked out.  "Um, I was planning on it", I retorted.  Seems that the shirt was Marines, but the jacket and pants were Army.  She explained members of either branch may take offense at my mix-matchy-ness.    Seems it is my destiny to be emasculated by cute teenage girls.  I thanked her for saving me from a beat-down, paid my tab, and hit the road with my new gear.

What the heck, I aint coming back, so might as well put em on blast.  I was pretty excited to have a pedi date with both J-WoW and Kazi-face, because it had been a hot minute since I had my toes worked on, and my previous pedi didnt even last 3 months.  ;)  First thing I noticed, was a relatively small waiting area (3 seats), and J pointed out a limited wall of polish color.  We were escorted back to our awaiting chairs prior to our reservation time, as to free up 2 of the 3 chairs in the waiting room  I did like the fiber optic light changing color in the basin of the chair.  Outside of the paraffin, that's about all I enjoyed during my stay at Chez Chemical Burn.  Yes, I opted for the callous, and yes, both my feet felt the effects of fiery acid melting away the healthy skin with the dead, which stressed me out, and as we all know, stress is very damaging to the epidermis.  Unlike my first chemical burn, I knew it was only going to keep burning worse, so I immediately let the tech know, and she quickly rinsed the acid off and hit me with a sugar scrub.  The pedicure seemed to fly by, and before I knew it, the tech was standing to my right, giving me what appeared to be a massage.  Not really sure though.  Like I said, the paraffin was enjoyable, and I opted for some Minions nail art, which wasnt sealed with a top coat, and thus ruined less than 18 hours later at the water park.  The dream team did manage to take some super cute pix before bouncing.  L8r dayz Biagio...

Yeah, its the baby superstore.  Think Bed Bath & Beyond, but strictly for babies.  Everything is compartmentalized into its own section.  Super cute with a huge selection.  And if you're a fan of Annie's Cheddar or Whole Wheat Bunnies, come here to get the Annie's Cinnamon Graham Bunnies.  Simply delightful!

If you think people shouldn't be able to tan after 7pm on a Friday, then Perfect Tan on Alma School is just the place for you.  But if you're a proponent of the American Way, and radiating your little booty with UV until 9pm, then comrade, you've just found your last bastion of khaki-colored freedom!  Solar Waves is a clean, dynamic looking tanning salon, that's taking over my heart.  EVERY time I've come in, my stand up booth was ready to go.  Even if I had to wait, the max tan time is 10 minutes... so unless the current occupant has a strap-on prosthetic or is rocking scissor-like hands, your typical wait at a Dutch Bros will be longer.  There's a tanning cream bar along the wall, where you can fill up a shot glass with a bronzer of your choice (its less than $13 for 5 shots).  Check often for discounts.  IF YOU WRITE A REVIEW ON YELP, BRING IT IN WITH YOU, AND GET A FREE PACKAGE UPGRADE FOR ONE USE!  Say you have the Diamond package.  Write a review, get a chance to try the Platinum bed... a savings of the normal $12 upgrade fee!!!  And Friday's are half price upgrades!  Remember, the big prices you see at the top are for those with memberships.  You'll be paying slightly higher prices, if you dont plan on being a member.  The employees have also been stellar, personable and friendly.  You'd be a Kim Jong-un loving communist if you went anywhere else.

I enjoy being accompanied by knowledgeable customers during my first time experiences at new restaurants, so I was quite pleased when Yuko suggested Thai House after our late afternoon hike at Camelback.  I had read her review the day prior to coming, so I recall her photo of what appeared to be a peanut curry.  It's a name I am not familiar with: Mus-sa-mum... but its a taste I will crave until my descent into frontal lobe dementia is but a forgotten memory.  It was a delicious peanut curry sauce, with strips of beef and chunks of white potato.  Some sauteed button mushrooms would have been divine, but I'll keep that recipe in my pocket for now.  I think I'll call my version: Mush-sa-rum.  I already have a twinsie, so I opted for their green curry over an "I'll take that as well".  It was every bit as delicious as my first green curry, so dont worry, Murray.  All arrived at the table with a large bowl of sticky rice.  After spooning both curries over my starch, my chop stick skills impressed my hiking partner so much, that she commented "Why dont you just use a fork"  I would love to come back and try a noodle dish, or a Tom Kha, or some egg rolls.  The food was wonderful, portion sized generous, and the kids working didnt hassle us for hanging around and carrying on for an hour or so

Probably the best Pad See Ew I've ever had, but let's start from the beginning...  Immediately upon walking in, I was given... bar none... the most hospitable reception in my short history of dining.  It was comprised of a greeting (including being called by name) and a hug from the cutest little thing, who I had just met.  We started off with a chicken satay app, which was accompanied by a creamy peanut sauce and cucumber salad.  Removing the delicious skewered meat from the wooden spears brought me back to days of yore, when I would covertly poke my little sister in the closest appendage, with the sole purpose of evoking a squeal, all the while under the auspices of my no-nonsense parents.  My go-to Thai dish is Pad See Ew.  I've seen it spelled differently, but I'm hip.  This dish was one to be savored.... no, to be fawned over and then savored.  Using my meticulous chop-stick skills, I pampered each delicate noodle into my quivering mouth... which evoked blissful visions of lazily floating down the Chao Phraya river... and mind you, I've never even been to Thailand.  I'm not saying the dish was laced with opium, but at some point, I do recall fancying a ride atop an Asian Elephant passing through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest.  My lunch companion, Chris, ordered the basil fried rice, which was more akin to an architectural wonder than an entree.  Using his meticulous spoon skills, I witnessed him moving mountains... of succulent rice and fixins... never to be seen again, for at least eight hours.  And just when I thought our culinary journey was disembarking, the same vision of loveliness appeared to my right, presenting a showpiece comprised of cake, cream and maraschino cherry.  Knowing my chop-sticks would only make a mess of things, I grabbed a spoon.  It had been so long... but it felt good in my hand.  A little cold.  I raised that utensil to the sky, and with an intense bellow, I cried "By the power of GreySkull, I shall have you as my own".  As I started my initial swipe, I noticed Chris had already gotten 2 or 3 bites in during the fanfare.  BAM!  The cake was bursting with coconut gusto, or maybe it was the ice cream.  I'm embarrassed to think of what I probably looked like as I descended into that dessert feeding frenzy.  I'd like to offer apologies to any staff and/or patron within line of sight.  I don't get out much, and unfortunately whenever my taste buds are stirred up like that, its plain and simple mob mentality.  I cant get in their way!  I wont!  After paying the tab, I bid a fond adieu to the huddled kitchen crew, and noticed their horror stricken faces.  The audible syllables "Mujumbo hielan friacah" lilted through the air as I passed... which I believe meant: "Great manly warrior"... no, my bad, wrong dialect... it actually means: "Portly destroyer with awkward shirt cleavage".  I look forward to my return visit, where I will exercise self control... or maybe just exercise

Great for lunch, great for happy hour.  Probably even better when its not 114 degrees outside, since they have roll-up walls that will really open up the area when the mercury is more accommodating.  Loved the half-sandwich/salad lunch combo.  Their strawberry spinach salad is worth coming back for, and the paninis are manly enough for my lunch bunch, since they're packing baby swiss, roasted red pepper, and bacon horseradish spread.  Their happy hour specials are great, with $5 sangria's and $2.50 drafts.  That's right Spanky, come get your PBR on!

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...  Where to start? 1.) Gee, the fried shrimp was pretty fishy. 2.) The innards of the spring roll were pure mush. 3.) Their aesthetically pleasing red spare ribs tasted funny. 4.) The frickin chicken on a stick & fried chicken wings were very dry.  5.) What the... very odd taste for their orange chicken. 6.) Never had sweet tapioca soup before, and will likely never again. 7.) The dumplings consisted of a sweet breading around a savory BBQ pork center.  Sweet & salty should usually go together well, but it wasn't a good sweet.  I'm not a shellfish eater, so I cant cash in on the crab legs.  Visited their sushi bar, and the tuna rolls I had were pedestrian.  My daughter said the California Rolls tasted funny, and to me they smelled fishy.  They also have a Mongolian grill which I didn't try, because I didn't have any cash for a tip... I'm cool like that.  The service was good and I enjoyed the piped in Gaga tunes. Maria was a pleasant waitress.  But Zen, at about $46 for 3 buffets and soft drinks, you ain't foolin me again.

Stopped by here for a gift for my buddy NBOD.  Jim greeted me as I entered the establishment, and asked how he could help.  I mentioned that I was looking for a gift for a friend.  After some qualifying questions, he suggested specific items from his stock, describing each.  After I told him I was with Yelp, he offered to give me a tour.  They have a room in the back.  It is Byob. Beer & wine only.  They have an 8 ft conference table, poker area, and dual flat panels. It's all free for the use, and all they ask is that you purchase your cigars there.

4 star sandwiches, 2 star sides.  Both the potato & macaroni salads were sweet, and that's not my bag, baby.  Ham & turkey on sourdough was good.  The turkey, bacon & avocado on wheat was amazing, but next time it will be turkey, bacon & avocado on sourdough.

I've been a patient of Dr David Matter for over ten years, putting up with a twenty-plus minute drive since moving from Gilbert to Chandler.  I didn't enjoy the drive, but I really liked him, so my eye never wandered... until one day a fancy mailer caught my eye.  I recall seeing the phrase "paraffin wax", and baby, that's all she wrote.  After walking into the unassuming office, which faces Alma School (you'll park on the opposite side of the building), I excitedly anticipated which part of my anatomy would be waxed.  The office is adjacent to a colon hydro-therapy business, so I really didn't know what to expect.  Mesha greeted me, and suggested I take a seat.  After blurting out something about spa treatments, she summoned Dawnie, who I immediately took a shine to.  She was utterly charming, referring to moi as "sugar" and "honey".  Where's the tip jar, cuz daddy's ready to slap it down!  After being ushered to one of their "relaxation rooms", and seeing an ultra-modern massage chair, I shifted focus to Dawnie and let out an "Oh Mama!".  She coaxed my shoes off, and had me dip my paws into a crock pot of translucent wonder.  First the palms, then the backsides.  Each hand was bagged and summarily placed into a soft mitten.  I was led to the chair, which had foot massage apparatus, which I have never seen before.  Asking for a photo, I realized my camera was tucked into my front pocket.  Dawnie, realizing I was about to try and stuff my baker-sized oven mitt in my jeans, offered to take the photo and text it to me.  The massage chair was activated, and I spent the next 15 minutes in Pamper-ville.  Tessa, my hygienist, came to fetch me.  She even carried my clod hoppers to the cleaning room.  Total sweetheart.  After completing the cleaning, I had the pleasure of meeting Dr Caryn Lee.  The whole experience was one pretty woman after another.  I love ya Dr Madder, but these breezies got me on lock.  ps. They have the ability to mold your crown in-house, same day, so NO TEMPORARIES!!!  YAY!

These guys seem reputable, and they had the best price for an oil change/tire rotation package I could find.  They detailed some work which needed to be done to my braking system.  I'll take it to another brake shop to verify their suggestions.

If you're going to eat your feelings, you're not going for Chinese... you'll just be depressed an hour later.  I came here on a whim, wanting to carb load before an early Camelback hike.  Being my first time, I was surprised at the crowd waiting for a table.  When the hostess informed me of a 20 minute wait time, I spied a lonely seat at the bar and made a break for it.  I asked the enthusiastic bartender for a hefe and orange, but the unfiltered wheat beer was not on the menu.  He convinced me to go with a Peroni, and it was sheer perfection, and balanced perfectly with my meal.  The $4.50 a bottle seemed steep... I must be conditioned for the dollar PBRs.  Starting out with the fried ravioli appetizer, which consisted of four large puffs of ricotta in a pasta shell, swimming in a delightful marinara.  This dish was smooth and cheesy, each bite eliciting the next.  I should have stopped here, but I hadnt eaten all day, choosing instead to brood in a bed with sweat stained sheets.  For round #2, I decided on the chicken parm, due to Ashlie's review.  To me, the red sauce on this dish tasted strange, unlike the savory sauce from the appetizer.  Of course, that didnt stop me from eating 72.8% of it.  The entree also came with two thick slices of toasted french loaf and a chopped anti-pasto salad.  This place rocked!  And the bar aint a bad place to saddle up to.  It's like the single-riders line at DCA's Radiator Springs Racers

Never had matzo ball soup until last year when I attended the UYE here, and now I'm swinging with the best of them.  Cant get enough of that dish (or bowl).  Totally perfect for when you're not feeling so well.  Its even great when you feel fine.  The Pastrami is great too.  My favorite sandwich is their Reuben with Pastrami (you can get it with corned beef).  Their potato pancakes are served with applesauce and sour cream.  I adore them.  And don't get me started on their fantastic Jewish Sliders.  Love Seinfeld?  You'll find many episode goodies here.  Black & white cookies (Look to the cookie Elaine), chocolate bobka (They're going in first with the last bobka), cinnamon bobka (Cinnamon takes a back seat to no bobka).

Hmmm, the pulled pork tastes... tastes like regular meat... no smoked pork seasoning taste.   And the texture? Well, stringy, chewy consistency, probably undercooked. I see a smoke ring, but don't really taste the smoke flavor.  The hot BBQ sauce on my table is like hot Mexican salsa.  Pick some up today as it would probably go great with enchiladas.  Looking to my right, but what should I see?  Nothing covering the rack of cornbread, which is sitting by the stove. Flies (or most anything else) could settle down on it unfettered.  But I have to say, the cornbread was soft & moist. Mine fell apart when I picked it up, and it did have a superb taste.  The lunchtime staff is attentive, and we were greeted upon entry.  The sweet potato fries were tasty and crisp on the outside.  A bit skimpy on the coleslaw, and wow, no standard mac-n-cheese or potato salad on the menu, yet, there was nothing particularly exciting about the menu.  The sample big cookie was horrid, and (look away) I had to spit it out. It was dry, crumbly, void of brown sugar or butter. No flavor! Its a sad day when you have to spit cookie mush out.  To me, BBQ is a 'from scratch' type of food, and when you cut corners by using a pre-made pie crust for your sweet potato pie, or are dumping a bag of frozen sweet potato fries into the fryer, it disappoints. (though I have to give them props as they were pretty good)

I stopped by today to get a key lime bar, but it was sold out.  I decided to go with the Pineapple/Raspberry.  My first impressions: the product is high quality, very tasty, and survived a 7 minute ride home in 106 degrees (my vehicle's AC is lacking).  The staff was attentive, friendly, and informative.  There is a branded sticker on the wrapper, and my daughter wanted it for the back of her phone.  They do have another location in Tempe, but if you are familiar with Porkopolis, at the north-east corner of Arizona and Willis, you'll be able to find Paletas Betty there as well.  The only reason I didn't award 5 stars, was the price.  $3.04 including tax, seems just a bit steep, but you do get what you pay for.  I'll pay it to try the key lime bar...

Wow, customer service unparallelled!  They sell all of the parts I need for the kit that I bought.  I'm going to step up to an audrino quad copter, and they have assured me that even if I don't buy the frame and motors there, I can get the components, and they'll give me all of the help I need.

'Cute' kind of sums this place up.  I like their selection of flavors and toppings.  They've got an iMac in there, and one of these days, I'm going to get on it.  The outdoor tables and chairs are cute.  We love this place, and walk the 3 mile round-trip twice a week for their fanciful flavors.

These guys are a great deal, if you know what to order.  All of their famous complete meals come with fresh baked bread (and it is great sourdough, providing you get a hot loaf), soup or a crisp green salad with choice of dressing (small upcharge for Ceasar), and a beverage (providing you order either coffee, hot tea, iced tea or milk - NOT SODA), and their signature spumoni or vanilla ice cream for dessert.  We went a little wild this time and ordered the toasted raviolis. Loved em.  Today's tip: Don't order the HEARTY MEAL larger serving if splitting between two hungry adults.  It ain't a double portion... no matter what your server says.

Within 48 hours of my initial review, I received an email from corporate, saying the situation mentioned in my review was rectified, and offering me a gift card for my troubles.  Shortly after that, I received an email from the local Planet Sub apologizing for the 'sharpie' taste and offering a complementary order.  This company pays close attention to the customer and works to resolve any problems.  They display exemplary customer service and I look forward to being a loyal customer

PS has been getting a lot of my lunchtime business lately.  Usually go for the sub, but on a whim, decided to order a Chipotle chicken wrap.  Why do they call it a wrap, because essentially, its a sandwich, in a burrito.  I'd much rather be eating a "Sanrito", which makes me think of Hello Kitty.  Conversely, the "Burwich" makes me think of Burma, now called Myanmar, which makes me think of self-immolating monks... which brings me right back to the roasted chicken in this here wrap.

I have just one complaint here...  The 'Native Puffs' appetizer was the 2nd worst app I ever had. A trail of sludge on the serving platter was very noticeable, as I slid the puff over to my dish.  But I didn't find any BP slush fund here to compensate my queasy stomach.  And the filling was comprised of nasty canned processed cheese.  The manager said he would give these to us at happy hour pricing, but that promise didn't make it to the check.  Now on to the good stuff.  Their pizza rocked!  The crust was perfectly crisp, the sauce was seasoned to my taste, and the toppings were spot on.  Their wings were deep fried perfectly.  I just love the honey-hot flavor.  Our server was very attentive (and his station was slammed), and the manager (and some other friendly employee) came over to check on us, telling us about an upcoming free wing special.  Even when one of the other server's bumped my arm as he walked by, he made a point to get my attention to apologize. (Results not typical)  They have $3.00 22oz domestic tap for happy hour.  Boo Native Puffs. Hooray Beer!  PS. I agree with Richard.  Try Blue 32!

Thanks to Groupon (free advertising, guys), my family got a heck of a deal on our dinners.  The atmosphere was cozy, but can get cramped real quick come Friday's happy hour.  Their spicy spring rolls were made of a thicker won-ton type wrapper. They fried ours a little too long, so it had a slightly burned taste, as well as char marks. The plum sauce was overpoweringly fruity. One of my least favorite spring rolls ever.  Their satay beef was very peanut buttery. Not great, but tasty enough.  I thought their teppanyaki beef and yakisoba was excellent!  Their hong kong flat rice noodles were very mild. Kind of like grilled chicken and noodles.  Children and most geriatrics may find this to their liking.  The spicy yellowtail sushi was served seaweed on the outside. Very good.  Amanda was a great waitress. She worked us a great deal, and offered suggestions.

I love the owners.  Very friendly and accomodating.  One night we had called after they had closed, and were pleasantly surprised when someone answered.  Turns out they were hosting a private party.  They agreed to take our order, which made us pretty happy.  I adore their Greek fries.  Olive oil, lemon, and the perfect amount of fetta.  Been here several times for lunch, and always leave happy.  Looking forward to meeting friends here for happy hour.

Kids love Disney, and so do I.  One of my favorite things at this location (as opposed to the AZ Mills location) is the magic princess mirror.  Grab any of the princess items (shoes, tiara, wand, etc) off the rack, and wave the package with the UPC symbol facing the jewels and mirror, and after a few seconds, that particular princess will appear in the mirror with a little story for the kids.

I never get sushi for lunch... but today I got sushi for lunch.  {rant}However, what I really want to talk about was how Yelp directions, a-la Google maps, decided to route me around the entire Wal-Mart parking lot, subjecting me to untold peril at the hands of amateur roll-back seekers and creatively bespectacled geriatrics whose forte would be anything but vehicular-centric.{/rant}  The place was suspiciously empty upon arrival, which always makes me a little antsy.  Are there no customers because the quality is lacking, or are the previous occupants of my current seat deceased, stacked neatly in the walk in freezer?  My fears eased after whipping out my scorpion light while inconspicuously spraying luminol.  After fanning away the ammonium carbonate smell, I was ready to order, and order I did.  Playing it safe, I went with the Baja roll, because it had like double tuna and was adorned with crispy tortilla strips... much like a chicken tortilla soup, without the mock poultry or intensely painful mouth blisters.  I initially thought it was drizzled with cilantro aioli, which I mentioned several times to the chef in an attempt to win him over with my nutritive know-how... only to be corrected that it was indeed a jalapeno vinaigrette.  "Ah, but of course!  Much like its distant cousin, the aioli", I shot back, saving culinary face.  One order of the house edamame was appropriated, along with an iced tea, which must have been freshly brewed, given its strength.  And the soybean pods were bathed in a piquant garlic sauce/spread/aioli which kept the Vampire rolls at bay.  The chef was quite friendly, stopping by the table for further banter, in which I found out that (a) he dabbles in cosmetology cut and coloring, (b) he has a fondness for a Hamlet quote, and (c) has conducted several experiments relating to food allergies.  He is in the running for the most interesting sushi chef in the world.  He invited me back M-Th for 20% off rolls.  At least I think he did... my mind was still pondering the imy Hamlet quote

Sure, the first time I came here was with a Groupon in hand, but I came back 7 days later ready to pay the full fare.  I love the ambiance of the dining area, and the food is great.  Looks like they've worked out any kinks with their service, as ours was impeccable on both visits.  I really enjoyed the lunchtime Chicken Katsu Bento Box, the Yellowtail Jalapeno specialty roll, and the Tempura Ice Cream.  Even my 15 month old granddaughter ate everything I sent her way.  The Sushi Room has quality and taste that span generations.

Let me start of by stating that Katie was our server, and she is destined for so much more.  I cant say enough about her attention to customer service.  Bravo!  They have good lunch specials, and great summer specials: * SUNDAY: All day HH prices and kids eat free * MONDAY: 1/2 price rolls for any roll on the menu * TUESDAY: 1/2 price sake bombers * WEDNESDAY: GROUPOFF Night, spend $15 - get $30 * THURSDAY: Beat The Heat. The high of that day determines the percentage off your bill, ranging from 20% if it reaches 100 degrees to 40% if it reaches 115 degrees.  Great ambiance, great decor, great food... and they have outdoor seating for those beautiful evenings.  Having a small get together?  Check out their intimate table tucked away in an alcove (left side when you walk in) which seats between 6 to 8 guests.

I feel like I should get a free t-shirt and my photo on the wall, after finishing that!   -Bretters  Well, Sunny did say "no naked carbs"... so I think the bacon and blue pancakes meets that requirement.  Once I heard the tale of such a pancake, I knew I had to make it mine, being a blueberry fan from way back.   Thinking the portion size would have been smaller, I also augmented my order with a side of the jalapeño infused bacon.  What a sheer delight that was, not too overpowering... like baby bear's porridge, it was "just right".  If you like the bloody, then try theirs, as they take that jalapeño bacon grease and muddle their vodka in it... for a taste like no other.  I was so impressed with the pancakes, and how much they served you.  No wonder you get a full bottle of syrup on the table... you just might need it, there captain.  They also have a lemon ricotta pancake, which I'd try next weekend if the place wasn't so far away... and if I wasn't putting on weight like that one time I used those misprinted Deal A Meal cards

I happened to pop in one evening after dining at a local establishment.  George greeted me and signed me up for a free class.  When I arrived for my initial training, I noticed several younger patrons in the area, and wondered if I was wasting my time.  Then I noticed George working with another gentleman of my stature.  He finished up, and then greeted me, giving me a run down of the activities which would take place over the next 30 minutes.  We did cardio, he put on mitts and let me hit them, I worked the bag, and then finished up with sprints.  I was dripping wet when I left my first session, and that made me happy.  I came to sweat, and I knew I was going to get my money's worth when I signed on for 12 sessions.  Want a fun, different kind of workout?  Is your current fitness routine just that?  Routine?  Then head over to Ringside and ask for George.  Tell him Brett "Fists of Curry" sent you.  But bring your own hand wraps.  You won't want someone else's nasty all up on your epidermis.

Well, sometime between last week and now, George was terminated.  So a young lad of 20 named Mitch was assigned to me.  If he had blond hair and an extra 40 lbs, he'd look a whole lot like Dolph Lundgren from Rocky 4.  Mitch kept the workout moving quick, and kept it heavy cardio.  I got my money's worth.

UPDATE: I am your 2015 OTF Ultimate Weight Loss Challenge winner, shedding 27lbs in 6 weeks.  Before coming here, I felt powerless against my relentless weight gain. I cant promise you the same results, but I can guarantee it worked for me!  I am so pleased with the results I've attained since coming here.  And, yes, it's kinda pricey, $159/mo, but my employer provides me a discount.  Ask if yours qualifies you for one.  OTF offers several classes a day, every day (I'd assume holidays excluded).  You can book classes at the front desk, or by using their very handy mobile app.  Never been to their website, but you might be able to book there too.  As a member, you'll receive a hand towel, a shirt and a chest strap.  When you show up for class, you snap a heart monitor into your chest strap.  Dont be a nasty... wash that strap routinely.  Then when the session starts, you'll see a little box displayed on the overhead flat panels with your name on it.  You can see your heart rate, the zone you're in, and the cumulative calories burned (both for you and the whole class).  Now, just because you're a member doesn't mean you'll automatically get into any class you decide to stroll in for.  There is a limited amount of stations, so class size gets capped.  That's why you must book early and often.  And while OTF provides a gut-wrenching workout, it's only as hard as you allow it to be.  So as Kenop says: Get your mind right, and the rest will follow!  But self flagellation here wont do you a darned bit of good if you don't control what you ingest.  You cant out-train a bad diet, so you gotta get your mind right before dropping that coin.  I love the 5:15am classes.  Kyle, Kenpo and Jesse will be there to motivate and direct.  And you always walk away with a little something special and a smile when Jesse gets down with his bad self!  I love these guys

I have a long term relationship with other Cousin's establishments, like over a decade of mostly good times, and each store is a little different.  For example, this store serves french fries, and they are pretty good.  I think this location's mantra is: It's better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission.  I've been here a handful of times, and each time I've had an issue arise.  My first visit occurred within 15 minutes of closing.  The staff told me they had run out of bread.  I countered by asking them if they were just saying that because they had just cleaned up and didn't want to have to clean again.  I walked out with only my dashed expectations to satiate me.  On my second visit, I was picking up an order I called in (learned my lesson from the first visit).  But when I passed around my Philly Cheese-steak to the family after getting home, the general consensus was that the meat tasted funny.  One call to the manager (owner) and he remedied the situation, surpassing my wildest expectations.  My third visit was reminiscent of the first, as they were out of wheat bread.  That is soooo annoying.  On my fourth visit, I was picking up an order I placed online.  Imagine my surprise when the staff told me they didn't get that order, pointing to a lonely printer behind the counter sans any printed orders.  I half expected that, but I took the opportunity to besmirch their online ordering process.  Before I walked out, I decided to check the bag to verify the contents, and wouldn't you know, it was missing the cookies.  Now I know what you're thinking... that SOB forgot to bag your dessert... let's kick his ass.  Sarcasm noted.  Its not that I was really peeved, but it is indicative of their attention to detail.  On the drive home, I tore into my sandwich and received another bout of disappointment as my Italian bread was either old or stale.  The owner seems to be a great guy, but he needs to start paying attention and 'get his house in order'.  Contrasting my recent experiences at this location to Steve's Crazy Subs in Gilbert, will have the latter receiving my sandwich business for the foreseeable future.  Steve's track record gets it right the first time.

Stay far away.  I don't need to be sharing a lap lane with another swimmer while I'm trying to get my mile on.  This place is perfect.  Perfect location (I can bike to here, and then bike to work), perfect amount of swim lanes (usually will be two to a lane, but I've seen a trio working one), perfect price when you buy a punch card, great lifeguards, and they have showers.

I can only offer praises... yes, it can get busy, but it's worth the wait.  The spa pedicure has everything I could want... callous, sugar scrub, hot towel, and my personal fave... paraffin.  It's like that line from Karate Kid, "Get him a body bag!"... yes, I would love to fully immerse myself in that toasty elixir of softness... even m'lady parts.  It's like Snuggle for your epidermis... but alas, they'll only agree to wax your feet... which is good enough for now.  They accept AMEX, Visa & MC, but appreciate cash for gratuity.  I think they'd prefer cash for the whole shebang... I know I would.  They also have no qualms with putting a bright coat of hi-gloss on your little piggies... they will call your bluff... so know this before wandering down a bad path.  And when your done, strut those newly pedicured feet down the asphalt runway to Inta'Juice for a little wheatgrass action.  No one's gonna spoil your party, not today!

I really wanted to love this business... rally I did.  Dave's is one of the few places in the area that will work on lawnmower engines.  Well once upon a time, I had me a mower that just refused to start.  I replaced the air filter and cleaned the housing, to no effect.  I figured the next step was a rebuilt carburetor.  After a quick search, I found Dave's via Yelp.  I called them up to confirm that they did indeed work on lawn mower engines, and headed right over.  The place is pretty cool, kind of a throwback to my earlier years, when life wasn't much more than otter pops and big league chew.  I plopped down my $20 deposit and headed home... to an overgrown yard and a love letter from my HOA.  Called Dave a week later to check on it, but it wasn't ready.  A few days later, it was!  Came down, paid an additional $102, and took my mower back home to do some big time pruning.  30 pulls of the starter cord later, my mower roared to life.  But I was a tad winded, and for $122, I would have thought 3 pulls suffice.  So now, every time I roll 'ole bessie' out for another trim job, I make sure I've warmed up my shoulder, in anticipation of another yank-fest.

Not only have the employees been incredibly helpful and friendly to me, but I've found some entrees that I look forward to having, day in and day out.  They have microwaves on-site, if you want to cook and eat there.  I'm partial to the tacos, but because they are microwaved meals, the corn tortilla usually cracks before you can eat it.  For breakfast, my top 3 are: 1. Good Morning Sunshine: Spicy ground turkey, served over eggs and rice, topped with pico de gallo & cheese 2. Farmhouse Steak & Eggs: Yukon gold mashed potatoes and scrambled eggs, paired with marinated flank steak 3. Breakfast Tacos: Lean ground turkey with eggs & cheddar cheese, served over corn tortillas  For Lunch, my top 3 are: 1. Chicken and Sausage Gumbo: Creole Style Chicken Breast & Andouille Sausage Gumbo 2. Shredded Beef Tacos: Spicy shredded beef topped with pepper jack cheese, served in corn tortillas 3. Omega Me Crazy Salmon: Ginger glazed Scottish salmon with sugar snap peas & carrots  For Dinner, I've only tried the Ninja Tenderloin and the Butternut Pork.  I love the tenderloin, and the heated fresh spinach is pretty good.  I enjoy the pork, but the butternut is a little too al dente for me.  But all this is clean eating at its finest.  Check out the stats on some of these meals.  The protein count ranges right around 40g a serving for the regular sizes.

"I want it, oh, I want it Oh, I want it for my own I've got to know I've got to know What is this place that I have found?  What's this?" - J. Skellington   The lunch bunch had wanted to enjoy Crepe Bar for many months, but had been previously scared away by reports of insane wait times and limited seating (sohwee Janee P).  Realizing that they took reservations, I set aside a table for 6 (really 8) about two weeks prior.  And boy, am I glad I did.  Walking in with Ann R, I didn't see an available table in the place... which is when I noticed J-WoW and Linh were occupying the table of highest honors... the reserved hi-top.  Realizing that our party of 4 was not getting any larger, we shifted to one side of the table to free up four contiguous chairs, because we're thoughtful and stuff.  Our Sep outing found us at Salut Kitchen Bar with the greatest waitress of all time: Keary.  I found her male counterpart: Cody.  This dude embodied the essence of Crepe Bar, fun, witty, timely, and able to turn down a bribe.  I'll be back with more cash...  Being our first time, the table took a while to lock in on palatable entrees, and Cody didn't rush, even though the place was packed.  Even better, since we were at a reserved table, we didn't have to order at the counter.  Dining in a group really is the only way to go.  I paid for one savory crepe, yet was a partaker in four amazing crepe combinations.  I couldn't pick a favorite, they were all so good!  And Cody had the sensibility to hold off on the sweet crepes until our party had completed round 1.  But what's this?  We were being treated to a sampling of paper thin cut radishes on cultured butter.  Hey, it could have been served with ignorant margarine, and I wouldn't have known the difference, but it was nice to feel so froufrou... because, you know.. I'm in the fast lane from LA to Tokyo.  Okay  Upon arrival, I knew J's dessert was going to take the cake.  That crepe was bananas, B.A.N.A.N.A.S.  That crepe was also nutella, N.U.T.E.L.L.A!  One more round of free resplendent Rollos and we were ready for our PhotoOp... which Cody and team made happen.  Overall, it was a FABULOUS lunch.  I'll award the Crepe Bar an: A + + + + + + + + + + !  And I didn't even have to use my AK, today was a good day

After my morning Camelback hike, I knew just where breakfast was gonna be.  Rolling in around 7:30am, I knew I'd be beating the church crowd.  I've seen this place get packed, and its no joke, G!  My waiter, Darryl, was professional yet personable, allowing me time to look at the menu after offering a few suggestions.  The chicken fajita omelette was just the thing to satisfy the protein deficiency in me.  That bad boy was massive.  I dont think it was 4 eggs massive, but it was fairly sizable.  That entree came with hash browns and 2 large pancakes.  All were satisfying.  All in all, a good meal for when you're pondering the hand that life has dealt you... you know, when you feel like Ethan Hawke sitting at a card table in Training Day

I really like the pedicure at Furama, and they're the only salon I let put glitter polish on my piggies.  Sometimes their state of the art massage chairs alternate between goosing and squeezing my bum.  Sometimes, when you order the callous removal, they grate a hole in your foot with that cheese grating tool, and sometimes they don't... but the pedicure is so good you'll be back.  Their tagline should be: Furama Nails - So good, you wont care when we cheese-grate a hole into your foot.

On a whim, and because I thought it might provide for an amusing experience, I asked my cosmetologist daughter to wax my back.  I don't think she wanted to do it, as I was immediately provided with 3 reasons why it would be more expensive for her to do it than EWC.  Hey, I wouldn't want to wax my dad's back either...  I pulled up the website to perform a little recon, and noticed first-timers get a free waxing*.  Couldn't find what the star referred to, so I gave em a a call.  For guys, the free service could consist of an ear, brow or nose wax.  Booked!  Showed up, checked in, answered a skin questionnaire and awaited my mistress of pain.  Her name was Kayla, she was petite, had striking blue/green eyes, and is a talented artist.  After verifying that she had not yet detached any of her client's epidermal layers, and she didn't plan to make me the first, I let her approach my ears for the freebie.  Totally painless.  And since I had recently shaved, she had to tweeze some of the short hairs the wax couldn't pull.  I thought "this is going to be fun" as I removed my business blue button up long sleeve.  It wasn't until the 5th or 6th strip that I started to question my decision.  Ain't no funny @#$% happening, and it was starting to sting/burn/hurt.  Found out that some guys just get up and leave part-way through a back wax.  Probably because they aren't made to pay if they capitulate to a TKO.  Kayla suggested that I go to my happy place, and continued the depilation.  I winced with each spirited yank, like a captured spy who is continually open-hand slapped while bound to a metal chair.  Kayla, sensing my distress, or maybe noticing my perspiration sopping the protective paper table lining, would place pressure on the newly follicle-free area... and darn it, that helped.  It was rough, but we got through it together.  The $58 was rendered, along with a generous tip (how much should one tip a back waxer?) and I emerged with revealing, beautiful skin... under my dress shirt.  I was strutting, glowing, and feeling fabulous!  I took those 4 steps to gorgeous, and I never looked back.  However, when I fabulously strutted at home in front of the family, I was informed that there was a line of demarcation about two inches under my neckline which stretched from shoulder to shining shoulder.  It looked like a rip-curl of hair-nastys were about to white-cap.  Guess the neck and shoulders were not part of the full-back wax.  Must remember that for next time, or as I like to call it: 4 weeks out.  See you then Kayla, and this time I wont ask you to take pics

Huge props to J-WoW for orchestrating and inviting Linh and I to do something new.  This week, it was Vino & Canvas, a wine and painting party, which contained no wine, unless it was in the acrylic set we were using.  Being from the hood, I thought I'd just roll up with my spray paint tag-banger set, which is marketed as Crayola Airbrush Markers, also known by their street name: Blo-Pens  But no, they dont allow outside food, beverage, or spray markers with stencil sheets... and that's okay, because when you walk in, you'll see your station, ready to go, with some sparsely drizzled colors on a Styrofoam plate.  You'll use all that real estate, like Foofa, for mixing up colors!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_SvDFPG6tc   After taking some fun photos, we returned to our stations as the instructor was preparing to start.  Once it began, J was a woman possessed.  I had to stop and gaze at the wonder of her perfect circular strokes on canvas.  She flowed with speed and grace, and it was noticeable right away, that she is a talented artist.  But I'm an artistic "leper", or "lemur" at a quick glance.  So I listened to teacher and followed directions, not jumping ahead, and though my painting lacked the aesthetic qualities of J-WoW's or Linh's... mine was the only one to feature SpiderCat.  And super bonus brushes... guess what other Yelper was all up in the mix?  Chris H was, and we all got a photo together holding our finished products!  Yelp Represents!

When the king of pop decided against "Beautiful Young Thing" for his epic 1982 album, Thriller, that set the wheels in motion for what we know today as BYT.  When this place is packed, and it gets packed, you'll be doing the moonwalk as patrons enter and exit by means of any open crevice between you and the other line-mongers.  Michael was so right... You Are Not Alone, but tough it out, because once you sink those bleached choppaz into your first bite, you'll Wanna Be Startin Somethin.  I can personally vouch for the carne asada, chicked and birria tacos, with the later being my favorite.  My wife and I split a carne, cheese and bean burrito.  My only complaint was the fatty chunks, and the gristle.  I wont ding them too hard, as they were totally slammed.  The biggest disappointment of the night came in a styrofoam cup.  The side of frijoles we ordered had to have been from a can... like a can of Rosarita.  I can see them needing a fallback with as  busy as they were, its possible they could have sold out of the good stuff.  I wont know for sure, until my return visit.  I use Elmer's Tacos or Rancho Market as my bean baseline, so be on your A game guys, because based on The Way You Make Me Feel will determine if I'm going to continue to Rock With You, or not... because I will Remember The Time.  I also polished off an order of chips & salsa, a Mexican coke and a large horchata... so I left pre-diabetic and pretty stuffed... so much that I almost didn't recognize that Man In The Mirror.

Jack Black may be known for the "Get That Corn Outta My Face!" meme, where he slaps two ears on a stick from Esqualito's hands.  It was probably because Hector scored the offending vegetable from America's Taco Shop, which has an embarrassingly bad rendition of this barrio sensation.  I shall be known as the "Get That Corn Inta My Face!" guy, after ordering elote from the Joyride app offering.  I am the Albexican, and know good corn Mexican.  Yeah that rhymed, I do it all the timed!  Another win for the vegetarians comes in the Garden Variety Burrito, enchilada style... sawed in half, with competing red and green sauces covering each dismemberment.  Snicker's could never satisfy like this  Lil tip... when you order, say, a... pineapple auga fresca... drink it quickly.  If you let it sit, the ice will melt, and you'll end up with a watered down agua fresca... and your heart will be sad.  Finally, and potentially the most important aspect (depending on if you're actively on laxatives or not)... the bathroom scene.  Let's taco bout it.  There's three doors.  Choose wisely, don't doddle.  1. Guys & Gals (The most spacious of the three.  Like driving a Chevrolet Cordova) 2. Gals & Guys (This is the middle child... we'll call it Jan Brady) 3. Gals  (VERY CRAMPED... because gals get cramps?  I dunno...)

Surprised!  Amazed!  Astonished!  Stunned!  Shocked!  No, that's not my reaction after seeing my polished piggies... that's my disbelief at not being offered an upsell.  Yuko and I came after hiking Picacho Peak, with our feet needing sweet relief.  Mine actually needed a pedicure bad, as the previous pedicure's polish from 4 months prior, now looked like French tips on my downtrodden digits.  Take a couple of seconds and let that visual sink in.  I received a basic $25 spa pedicure, and the massage portion was pretty darned nice.  I probably would have bit on the paraffin upgrade, but that $5 is snuggled safely in my wallet

"I've never eaten a hot pocket and then afterwards been: I'm glad I ate that" -Jim G  All you need to know, is that these palatable pouches are anything but the frozen snacks made infamous by Mr Gaffigan.  J-WoW and I had been working up quite an appetite painting moonlit cherry blossoms, and wanted to pair our creative sides with a venue we'd never frequented... enter Yelp, which suggested this highly-ranked hideaway.  I was relieved to see a nearly packed parking area, as our previous potential eaterly was kinda ghost-town'ish.  J spotted a swanky hi-top, which suited me just fine... because the seats were 360 degree swivel!  Is there a better way to annoy that obnoxious group of strangers, sitting to the left of you, who ordered "samples" of Malbec and Shiraz?  Actually, I might try that sometime.  Oh, and it gets hella LOUD in there, son.  I looked like a fool with that waitress, yes, the one with the captivating red lipstain... after I referred to the cuisine as Cuban, or as I like to call it: Cuban-oh.  The fare is actually Costa Rican, or as I like to call it: Chican-oh.  Not knowing which of the appetizers to order, the waitress suggests the most expensive item, which I thought was a good choice.  After a little pleading, and emotional breakdown, J decided to trade halfs of her empenadas for halfs of mine.  That makes sense, until I realized I gave her both halves of my Pernil (slow roasted and specially seasoned pork).  I tricked her into trading one half back, because she tried to offload both halves of her Republica Chicken (chicken, fresh vegs and seasonings), onto me.  I saw how it burned her fingers after cutting it in half and picking it up.  As the scalding liquid ran down her fair hand, she screamed out      So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a lizzle     Got some cheesy drizzle, drippin' on my shizzle  All I could do was sit and stare.  I was captivated by my lil G, J.  I also ordered the Cubana (pernil, ham, mozzarella & dill pickle), which was fabulous (and J's favorite, even though she balked at first), and she also ordered the Jalapeño Popper (cream cheese, grilled seeded jalapeños & salted ham).  That oñe was my favorite, eveñ though I ñever order poppers añywhere, maiñly because I can ñever find the "n" key with the tilde, and that lack of autheñticity really cheapeñs the review.  "There is the vegetarian hot pocket, for those of us who dont want to eat meat, but would still like diarrhea." -Jim G  Anywho... they also offer empenadas that dont contain meaty things.  Choose the Greek (sauteed spinach, feta, sun dried tomato, kalamata olive), the Cheeze (asiago & mozzarella blend), the Bean & Cheese (black beans & mozzarella) and Achite Potato (potato, annatto seed seasoning).  That's right, fool, count em... 4 vegetarian selections.  So, if yous latch key kids are sitting around the house, and got nothing in the freezer, grab some cash from your parents dresser and call a neighbor to swing you by Republica Empanada!  Hungry kids in the crib, ma Pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot, pocket like it's hot

I'm going to have to side with the vinyl on the window.  NLS does open at 10am M-F, and thankfully for me, my second excursion to this unexpectedly spacious scuba store was fortuitous.  Walking in, I executed the traditional panoramic overview, sweeping my head from left to right, at which point I noticed Sheldon.  Throwing him a head-nod, I offered up a "What's up?" that probably sounded more like "S'up".  That is the bane of being raised on the streets of suburban Massachusetts, where the kids who weren't allergic to bee stings called the shots, and would gut you as soon as look at ya.  I mean, I wasn't actually raised ON the streets, but I did spend a fair share of my time playing near them.  I've been to a handful of dive shops here in the valley, and NLS has one of the larger showrooms.  Their assortment of gear isn't as vast as say, Sports Chalet, but its not a corporate conglomerate... and although I'm pretty sure I used that word incorrectly, as an adjective, it provided the appropriate amount of disparagement.  Interesting note... purchases over $700, if made through an approved GE Capital line of credit, will enjoy a full Gregorian calendar year of deferred interest.  Combine that with the 10% discount extended for being a club member, and that, my friend, spells savings.  For example, the regulator, oct (the yellow line and breather), wireless tank transmitter, and gigantic wrist computer I'm looking at run about $1900 combined.  Subtract the 10%, and divide principal-only payments over 12 months, factor in sales tax... minus the amortization, carry the two...  OK, I think we can all agree, I'm no math whiz.  But, if you purchase a regulator, you'll get the Equipment Specialist course for free.  That's a total prize package worth over $160 US... and I'm gonna do it... and not just because I said I was going to do it in this review... although that is mostly the reason.  And if lake diving aint yo thang, then stop by the trip and travel kiosk, located conveniently in the west wing.  NLS hosts monthly trips to San Carlos MX for only $599 pp based on double occupancy.  Here's the kicker.  You ain't staying in some musty hotel.  No my friend, your accommodations are located in an oceanfront luxury home.  That's how Antonio Banderas would roll, and gosh darn it, why should your roll have any less butter than his?  Two days of 3 tank dives are included, with an available third day of room and diving for a modest up-charge.  Have a little more chang-chang in your pocket, then consider Honduras.  Not only are they know for cigars and the flesh trade, but their diving is unparalleled.  Two words: shark diving.  Get up close and personal with the spiney blast-bots of the sea.  Only $1650 pp based on double occupancy.  All trip deposits are $500 min.  All gear can be rented at NLS.  I'm happy to have a shop, close enough to my house, to call my own.  P.S. That same GE credit card can be used at Global Bikes too.

I've gotten into The Habit on several occasions, as it's close to the office.... and each time I do, their Santa Barbara style American Double with a side of Green Beans, puts me in my fatty place.  After ordering, you take your vibrating drink coaster to a booth of your choosing.  The place has been fairly empty each time I've been there, so I make sure to grab a table right next to the only other seated couple.  I'll place the pager on the tabletop, grab a drink, and then peruse my phone.  Once the pager rattles against the table top, it's LOUD, like that vibrating football game from the 70s.  I let it resonate for about 30 seconds, pretending I'm really engrossed with my mobile device... I'm so precocious  The employees have always been friendly, the tables clean, and the condiment bar always has a heaping amount of jalapenos and those firm yellow pepper things that end up squirting spicy juice into my windpipe after biting into it, which temporarily causes me to gasp for air.  You never forget your first asphyxiation

This is the closest location to hit whenever I pick up J-WoW for an outing... and being a new customer, I'm so impressed by the locations I've been to.  These kids are having a ball, and the prices are phenomenal.  My jam is the sf Cocomo.  It allows me to feel like I'm enjoying a dessert, while getting all of the fat and none of the sugar.  *overt hip thrust*  J talked me into a sf Caramelizer last time... and I dont think she'll do that again

My hiking partner strikes again, as during our 2nd descent down Piestewa today, she asked some guys around us for a hamburger restaurant rico.  "Ingo's" they shot back!  It's a round, quaint little place, slightly reminiscent of the old Woolworth lunch counter style dining.  If there's a free seat, take it, or stand on top of the printed footsteps located behind each position at the counter  We had a waitress in training, and both she and her trainer were pleasant and charming, full of recommendations and suggestions.  The Paris, Texas burger caught my fancy, and I requested it with the BBQ sauce on the side, topped with a fried egg.  It arrived with a darling heart tipped toothpick which held the condiments in place.  The burger was delicious and juicy, with a light and airy bun, crisp bacon, and this amazing fermented jalapeno sauce.  I actually tossed back a shooter of one.  And the "potato chips" were thin cut, french fried potato rings, crispy on the outside, creamy inside.  And when customers were all paid up, they hit the "cookie jar" before bouncing, as there were fresh made cookies, free for the taking.  I can imagine this place gets crazy busy, as the food is so good I tried to talk Yuko into splitting another burger with me... its worth the wait!

In honor of my YFF being today's ROTD holder, I declare an end to my review hiatus.  Thailicious has sat motionless in my bookmarks for months, ever since mon ami Kristin J first alerted me to its existence.  The name alone evokes images of "superlicious delish", as the superlicious Mary A states.  The characters in this screenplay are as follows... Joyce W - my YFF and international essay contest winner, who I shall refer to as J-WoW.  If you want to read an actual well written review, check hers out. Linh L - one of today's top talents in beat-boxing, who I shall refer to as Mr Peanut.  If you want to read an actual amusing review, check his out. Brett B - the author of this autobiography, who I shall also refer to as Mr Peanut The Waitress - who I shall refer to as Flo  As an author, whose responsibility it is to convey an experience to you, the reader, I hope you'll be able to take away this... I arrived AND checked in prior to either J-WoW or Mr Peanut!  After 'handshakes & hugs', we gangsta strolled up into that beyaaaa...ah.  What a sight it must have been.  Two of us could have passed for cast members from the Asian version of Melrose Place, while the third closely resembled Zippy the pinhead.  We were promptly ushered to a booth with what appeared to be vinyl seats, and I make this distinction to inform the reader that as I scootched myself across the bench, an inopportune vibration was simulcast from the vicinity of my pants bottom.  Not wanting to appear like a wind-talker in front of my co-diners, I made an effort to replicate the sound by continuing my side-glide until successive audible vinyl rubs were rendered.  But no such vindication was attained...  My companions were a true delight.  Dear reader, may you be blessed with your own J-WoWs and Mr Peanuts.  Lunch doesn't always have to just be about binging on 1800 calorie entrees.  Open your heart, and your heart may just open you back.  I ordered the Pad See Ew, vegetarian style as a nod to my girl Cici F.  Now, I'm down with PSE, yeah, you know me.  It's my jam.  The dish gets my merkin a twerkin... however this one didn't have the je ne sais quoi of Thai Spices or Thai Rama, but that didn't dissuade me from a raucous display in which no less than half of the deadly sins were involved.  After putting in our dessert order, I asked Flo if she would be so kind as to provide me with a spoon, say... eighteen or nineteen inches in length.  Now here's the kicker.  She looked at me like I was a damned fool.  That delightful Thai Tea Creme Brulee dessert proved to be the meal's Swan Song. It boasted a sun kissed glow that could have passed for San Diego's own TM, a consistency smoother than my girl MC J, and was reminiscent of everything that's right about pumpkin pie without the benefits of high protein or dietary fiber.  How is no one singing its praises?  [Chorus - Nicki Minaj, J-Wow & Mr Peanut:] Flo, I got this short-azz spoon in my hand Beating like a drum on a treat that's all tanned Can't you taste that creme, bacreme, creme, creme, bacreme, bru, lee? You got that creme brulee creme, bacreme, creme, creme, bacreme, bru, lee Yeah, that's the creme brulee (Creme) [x15]  Side Note: If you enjoy leering at beautiful women from the shadows, as they make selections from a salad bar, then boy are you in luck!

I was sitting in a Thai Restaurant no less than 500ft away, when I saw Tricia F's check in for OHSO.  Since I was waiting for my daily special to arrive, I perused the photos from OHSO and made plans to swing by.  Today was a day made for al fresco burgers and pie at OHSO.  The sun warmed me as light breezes visited my table.  I was a little apprehensive about going with another burger, given the let down experience at Rehab Burger Therapy.  It was just too soon... but I had missed the AYCE Backyard BBQ cutoff time, so a BBQ Burger it was!  I was very pleased with the taste, and since I ordered it med rare, it oozed wonderful juice subsequent to every luscious bite, which the substantial bun sopped up.  The fries were nice, thin, shoestring, with a sprinkle of chopped parsley.  I dont know, I'm just making stuff up now.  The pies de resistance (which is weird, because the word 'pie' is in the phrase), was the Caramel Apple Pie from that one good pie place.  I think it's called like Pie Snob or something.  It was worth going up a jeans size for.  I take that back.  It wasnt worth it... because now I'm going to have to go out and try on some jeans, and I can never find a size that fits me right out of the gate.  It's always like 4 trips back and forth.  Take tight jeans off, try fat jeans on, look in mirror with disgusted expression, take fat jeans off, squeeze back into them darned tight jeans again, and waddle back to the display to rife through stacks of folded pants to find a different size.  But the pie was really good

Since I also think this is a 3 and a half star experience, I'll split the outstanding star with Ali B.  One morning, I found myself pulling into their weird parking lot... so I call Mr H and ask him if he wants anything.  He tells me "No thanks, I've already had my coffee".  "Alright bro, next time", I replied as I hung up, wondering if he actually heard that I was at "Señor Taco"  Then I called my boy A-A-Ron, catching him before heading into the office, and asked if he'd like something from Senor Taco (since I'd heard him and Paddy talking about their breakfast burritos the week prior)  "That's a 10-4 good buddy"  I've previously been to another Senor Taco, but never for breakfast.  Although I contemplated that the $6.49/ea price might be a little steep, I slapped down a Jackson, while under my breath in a falsetto, I sang "I'm sorry Ms Jackson, I am fo reeeeal"  I was pleasantly pleased by the girth or weight of the to-go bag.  I didnt know any lyrics that mentioned "girth", so I just falsetto'd out a "this bag's gotta lotta giiiiiiirth" as I bounced like a wrecking ball  Both Aaron and I sat in silence, he with his chorizo and I with my machaca, occasionally glancing at each other during chews, exchanging a satisfied head nod

I've been awaiting a great eatery to replace the now defunct Chandler BBQ Company, and the wait was worth it.  I've had both the meat tortellini with bolognese and the marscapone with butternut squash ravioli, both made from scratch, both delightful.  I have huge expectations for their artichoke parmesan.  The restaurant does have a Facebook page when you can come and get a little extra info.  It's quaint and cute on the inside (seats 16) and they have a nice sized outdoor patio with ample seating, for al fresco dining.  The chef, Carlo, is friendly and excited for you to try his creations.  They have a chalkboard menu behind the counter, where you'll place your order, and a deli case with meats, cheeses and olives... soon to include desserts.  They offer hot and cold sandwiches, salads, pasta (with your choice of six sauces), and a few side dishes.  The beverage options include a fountain station.  Stop by for lunch or dinner.  Stay for the ambiance or get it to-go!

This is where you go, when you first go to that new ramen place down the street for lunch, only to find out they've run out of food.  They've run... out of food...  Didja catch that?  You know what I liked about this place?  It's in like a hotel lobby, so if you want to use the restroom, you have to walk into the lobby, past the front desk, around the corner and down the narrow hall... as opposed to the foodless ramen place, which has a restroom icons above a hallway, but when I pushed through the door, I ended up in the kitchen.  The look the workers gave me was like "hey buddy, you're not peeing in here.  You're not peeing anywhere"  You know what else I like?  The fillet meat in the pho was chunk meat, not thin slices.  And it was good.  Did you happen to see my photo?  That was a good photo, huh?  I had help

I've dined with all the greats.  Pavaratti, Giovanni, Lipschitz... and none of them had the sense they were born with.  That's why I now dine with J-WoW.  Less than 32.5 seconds after walking into this establishment, she recommends that we each order something different, so we can double our exposure.  Yes!  I just know Bocelli would have ordered the same mac-n-cheese burger that I would have ordered... the blind fool!  J orders the stuffed mac&cheese and fries, while I go with the stuffed reuben and tempura green beans.  Sometimes you realize you lose.  While the tempura veggie is a "must-try", the reuben burger is a "must-miss"!  I just know Andrea is somewhere, singing to me, right now "Who's the fool now, you bald headed pelican?"  I'll be back to try the other creations.  I shall also give props to J-WoW's m&c stuffed burger (get it... no, I didnt drop an inside joke... I'm telling you to order it!), and I thought the outrageous fries were good... until they cooled down... then they were just embarrassing themselves.  Next time, a tin of dignity might be in order... hmmm?  I dont even know what that means.  You should have stopped reading a paragraph ago

Great little place that ain't so little.  The staff is friendly and informative, decor doesn't scream "buy stuff" like SB, and the product is tasty, served in ceramic black cups atop saucers.  If I could remember stuff, I could tell you how they make their own vanilla bean syrup AND marshmallows (no swiss miss minis here) with said vanilla, how they have chocolate flavoring from Brussels, which includes "white chocolate", which is made by mixing Greek yogurt with a dark chocolate.    Don't blame me if I totally hacked the facts... I was too preoccupied with the VIRTUAL loyalty punch cards, tracked through Square.  No more having to remember to put that card back in your wallet, Square tracks where and when you purchase, so I know my 20th cup will be on the house.  Sure, some Square vendor ran an $18,000 fraudulent order on my card, but we're talking free coffee here people!

When J-WoW told me about Thirsty Lion's amazingly generous offer to Yelp Elites, I was stunned.  All I had to do was send an email stating the day/time my party wanted to show, along with the Elites in my party, and they would provide us with a comped meal, including apps and desserts!  Parking wasn't too bad, in their ample lot, and was only a short walk to the front door.  Once inside, Tom D greeted us with a smile and a hearty handshake.  The interior was spacious, so I took a stroll to survey the estate.  This location includes a delightful patio area.  We were led to a reserved high-top table in the bar area.  Yes, they were expecting us.  It was about this time that our 4th, Kazi, arrived.  We hugged, we laughed, we looked at the menu.  Since the apps were on the house, I had to go with the Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna, since J decided on the Bacon Wrapped Dates.  My Ahi couldn't have been more perfect.  It was as good as I've ever had anywhere else.  And I shared my wares with the whole table.  For my entree, I had to try the Grilled Atlantic Salmon.  Once again, the fish was perfectly prepared.  At $21, it may be a tad expensive, and generous, for a lunch, unless you're sporting quite the noontime appetite, as it came with a mound of white cheddar mash and al dente green beans.  My friends and I were treated exceptionally well by the staff here.  It's quite a ways away from my home and office, but I would absolutely return if in the area.  Thank you Thirsty Lion management and staff

Lo-Lo's was bumpin on a Wed night at 8pm... and it was a rainy, dreary night.  That's gotta be a testament to how much peeps be loving the place.  I had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, but the waitress was very apologetic, acknowledging my patience, which was very nice.  I ordered the KK's with 3 thighs, because I'm not afraid of the dark.  When it arrived, my cheesy eggs looked a little runny, but the taste was all that, especially with the onions.  You may want to temper your use of the hot sauce.  The Lo-Lo's brand is very similar to Tabasco.   The hot and fresh fried chicken was better than my grocery store's, and I think Fry's has a pretty good product.   The waffle was reminiscent of Waffle House.  Why they gotta call it Waffle House?  They're not that good.  Truthfully, they should re-brand the "house" as "Waffle Bungalow".  You know who makes a great waffle?  Me!  So stop on by the next time I'm at your local Homewood Suites, and I'll whip you up a Belgian to remember  Everyone was incredibly friendly.  No less than 5 different people checked on me during my stay, one even patting me on the pack, but Christian was eggceptional!  I got 3 high-fives on my way outta the joint!  I felt like Aaron Carter, that time he beat Shaq

This place is cute and clean, so check it out before the masses leave their mark on this place.  Has a Batman Ride, huge rocking horse.

This place is cute, and was clean, but the masses have already left their mark.  What once was a great utopia of fun and frivolity, is now a shell of its former self, littered with games and rides that are "Out Of Order" or simply just ingest your hard earned tokens without so much as a "sad trombone" sound byte.  You know it ate your token... it knows it ate your token... but nobody's sayin nuthin.  The kids do adore Chuck E though, along with the parade that ensues about the floor, enticing children away from the not-so-watchful eye of their parents with promises of "free tickets".  My personal favorite from the Chuck E time, is getting to watch the employees who flag the mouse on either side, perform the Chuck E dance with great enthusiasm.  Then as 2 bags worth of free tickets are tossed in the air, like a Manhattan ticker tape parade, I wince as throngs of children dive head first toward the anticipated landing zone.  All in all, the pizza is decent, and they have a cool ice cream vending machine with prices that arent all gouge'y.  As long as she likes it, I'll keep coming back.  And while I understand my previous review was quite lacking, thanks to all the feedback I received, it was necessary in order to secure the "First to Review" slot.

Who has the true Aussie accent?  You decide! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIcOh-3-y5c   Yuko and I are on a roll!  After descending Camelback today around 4pm, we decided on pizza.  Base Pizzeria stands out because they hold a solid 5 STAR RATING!!!  After getting the full experience, I now understand why.  It's in a strip mall, so I wasnt thinking much as I walked into what was a pretty fancy dining room, especially for a pizza place.  White linen tablecloths with crystal clean wine glasses ready for the filling.  Some people know I'm a sucker for an Aussie accent, and they had me at Hello... literally, when I called up to see if they were open on Christmas Eve.  The same charming wonder from down under, led us to our table and offered up some recommendations.  Breaking tradition, I ordered a Cooper's Pale Ale from the Motherland, or is it Fatherland? ...Underland???  Anyways, it was a perfect, unfiltered beer with a refreshing taste, to this trail weary hiker.  I went with the meaty pizza, while Yuko chose the Mediterranean.  We made a secret pact to share slices... which turned out to only be one slice after she announced that her's was better.  Okay, I guess I'll just hold the monopoly on pizzas with fennel seeds.  The bottom line is:  COME HERE!  It's close to Camelback, and closer to Squaw Peak (Piestewa).  Take a train, trolley, cab, Uber, Lyft, hang glider, pogo stick... whatever.  Just come here.  The owners are super personable, really upbeat with a great energy, and just plain happy to have you there.  I recorded a 43 second video with the owner, that Yelp isnt allowing me to upload.  Dont make me send Crocodile Dundee up there to handle things.  Get your tech together, Yelp!

Argh... first impressions...  Walked in the door around 8pm on a S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... NIGHT... and let me tell ya, it was hella loud son.  Like, The Metro nightclub in Riverside, three decades ago loud.  Like you have to yell at a girl to ask her to dance loud.  However, the iced tea was wonderfully tropical, and I should know, just coming from the tropics.  I ordered the eggplant parm, because I love it, and can usually tell if a place is going to be good by how it turns out.  Fact: Carlo & Emilies has a great eggplant parm.  Even Buca has a pretty good eggplant parm... but not these guys.  It also came with fettuccine and red sauce, topped with a croissant.  Yeaaaah, like my mom used to make... from a canned sauce.  Granted, I should walk away with a lesson learned, but I'll return to try the pizza... next time with earplugs.

They got me hooked.  I can now finish a large iced sugar free Cocomo in under 50 seconds.  They need to offer a larger size

What happens when really good food is topped by stellar service?  Five stars!  I was invited out by "Aunt" Jib, to try out her family's new Thai restaurant.  After informing our waiter of this, and he lit up like a Christmas tree.  This guy was very happy... like a happy that's contagious...  Looking at the apps, we decided on their Chon Thai Chicken rolls, which were fabulously crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside, by what I can only assume to be potatoes???  It was served with a sweet spicy sauce and diced cucumbers and red onions, which gave it nice crunch and fresh flavor.  The Chicken Tom Kha was delicious, with its coconut broth and bobbing mushrooms.  My companion ordered the Drunken Beef Noodles and I went with the Panang Curry with Beef.  I adored both dishes, but was even more impressed when the waitress told me that I can call ahead, and place a special order for mussamun (pronounced "muss a mun", not "moose sa moon") curry, as its not on the menu.    For me?  You'd make a special dish just for me?  WHO DOES THAT?!?!  Then, as if they hadnt been kind enough, our waiter asks us not to go anywhere because he has a surprise.  A surprise for me?  What could it be?  A sword?  Clown makeup?  Singing lessons?  Wonderful gift ideas raced through my mind, but none were as tasty as the mango and sticky rice dessert which was placed before us.  On our way out, my companion mentioned to our waiter, how much we enjoyed his service, and he said that her words was the nicest thing that's happened all day.  My companion said he was the nicest thing that's happened all day.

"The best corned beef hash I've ever had!"  Ok, admittedly I've had corned beef hash like only three times, but the Bear knows how to sling it!  Cholla!  My hash came with a moderate portion of scrambled eggs, fresh fruit (instead of papas) and french toast.   The fresh fruit was a medley of sliced strawberries, pineapple and grapefruit.  Simply delightful!   The toast looked to me like it was going to be a big disappointment, but it pleased the palate.  And just because I can't turn down fresh squeezed orange juice, I continued my personal crusade against scurvey.  I left quite full, and since that ample feast only cost $15, my wallet left quite full as well

When Yuko wants to try out a new ramen place, you go with her, because she knows.  Our first time here was fabulous.  I ordered everything she did (Tonkotsu ramen and gyoza), because I was in ramen training.  In an unexpected turn of events, the ramen arrived before the appetizer, but that didnt stop me from wolfing down all 6 yaki gyoja once they hit the tabletop.  The ramen was a delight, with a delicious pork belly surrounded by things, a floaty egg and my first love: noodles.  The egg was cooked perfect, with a runny yolk.  This day was extra special, because that's when I found out about kae dama... which is Korean for "Bring me extra noodles, please".  I dont know, maybe its Japanese.  Anyway, an extra order of noodles is only $1.50, but it takes a frickin long time, so if you think you want some, order some once they set the ramen on your table.  During my return visit, the yolk was cooked too long, but the service was UNPARALLELED!!!  George, my waiter, was outstanding.  He essentially fawned over me, explaining the process, and showing me the fancy high tech noodle making machine from Korea.  This kid has a bright future in whatever he sets his mind to, because he has a winner's attitude!
