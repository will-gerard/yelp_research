Highly recommended if you are a visitor to Phoenix for the first time. A large variety of cacti- and some of those saguaros have to be 40+ feet tall! Keep in mind this is the desert, so don't expect lush gardens, but it is beautiful in its own right and if you are from the East Coast like me, it is amazing how alien this type of plantlife is to us.

Very cool place...HUGE! Lots of nooks and crannies with a wonderful selection of Day of the Dead- themed items. I bought two DOTD-themed tiles for $9 each. Wish I could have bought more, but only had so much room in my luggage.

Arizona's version of NY's Blue Hill at Stone Barns...very lovely grounds with three separate restaurants for your dining pleasure..review of their fine dining restaurant- Quintessence- is in a separate review but I wanted to note how impressed I was with the property. I came at night and it was lit up very nicely and there was a great feeling of serenity as we strolled through the property and took it all in. There was a wedding reception taking place in one area and if I lived in AZ I would definitely have considered getting hitched here.

I came here for lunch when we first arrived at the MGM and checked in, being it was one of the few restaurants open for lunch. First off, the bread they bring you is out of this world. I think I would have been fine paying for a bucket of that for my meal instead of what I actually got. Not that the cornmeal fried oysters or po' boy were bad, they just didnt do anything for me. The po' boy especially seemed to be all bread, I don't even recall at this point...and I have a memory like an elephant...what the hell was in it. The one thing about Vegas I wish would change is that more high end restaurants would be open during lunch hrs so people can try there fare for 'fairer' prices, even if its still expensive, heck...I'm on vacation...and it;s better than having to settle for another one of Emeril's crappy restaurants.

is there anything more glorious than a well-crafted burger? Why yes, a well-crafted burger with whatever the hell you want to plop, drop, dump, or slather on top, paired with a damn good milkshake, preferably with some alcohol added. My burger of choice was angus with grilled lobster tail, chipotle aioli, bacon, and avocado on an onion bun....with a coffee/Bailey's milkshake concoction thingy whose name escapes me. damn good though. And for dessert I had the tasting of 5 beer floats...5 different beers each paired with their own scoop of ice cream. Been done before of course, but 5 ways...and they were a nice size too....30 oz worth total. When you come to vegas you will come here, because I command you.

Beautiful, classy classy property without being over the top...very good taste all around IMO. Basic rooms are gorgeous with big marbled bathrooms, remote-controlled shades and a mini bar where if you breath on a bag of chips, they charge $11.00 to yuor room...so don't touch or move anything on or in there, because its ultra-sensitive. Great array of restaurants, too. Problem for me is..when I stayed there for three nights, I found myself getting bored..lacks the excitement and appeal to all demographics that I feel MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay deliver.  Would and will stay again on my honeymoon...I'm sure a room with a view of those beautiful fountains (the coolest "free' attraction in LV) will be oh-so-take-those-clothes-off-right-now-baby-romantic.

ithink MGM Grand is the only property in Vegas that might very well appeal to everyone....college kids on spring break, families, high rollers, and people on a modest budget all can enjoy themselves here. The place is HUGE, there is a LOT to do, a great selection of restaurants that touch on a variety of cuisines, including the great Joel Robuchon's namesake restaurant (a must do on my honeyroom stopover in Sept.). If you signup online or text them you can get pretty good deals on rooms (which are nothing special but get the job done and are clean and comfy). If you are going to Vegas for the first time, I recommend MGM. Then try Bellagio or mandalay next time. Oh by the way, get a players card and gamble and stay ONLY at MGM MIrage-affiliated casinos (there's like eight of them on the strip  I think). You can reap some incredible rewards..I just got two nights free at Mandalay Bay...so I'll be writing that review when I get back.

I don't know what the appeal of this place is..it has almost 900 reviews    ( at the time of me writing this review)...and a four star rating...and it was such a disappointment. I think people that eat here mainly go to eat out on the terrace and people-watch. Sole redeeming factor- great fries.

Even though I have wandered thru virtually every casino hotel on the Strip (except for a few of the crappy ones no one cares about)..I only review the ones I actually stay at. So this trip was my first time staying at Mandalay Bay..I got comped 2 nights and I did like the looks of the place so I figured why not...even though it is ALL THE WAY at the southern end of the Strip. The room was decent, nice big bathroom with tub and shower, though I'm not quite sure why there was a window between the bathroom and entrance foyer...unless we got one of the Kinky Rooms or something, though I don't really get off on watching my fiancee on the toilet, so this whole window thing is still over my head.   We had a great view overlooking the entire pool area...and that is one big pool area...I think I counted six pools and a river....and a wonderful view of the mountains in the distance. everything looked beautiful lit up at night...one of the reasons I love coming to Vegas...a beautiful city of millions of lights plopped in the middle of the barren darkness of the Nevada desert.   The hotel is laid out very nicely, everything is clean and classy...wonderful choice of restaurants, good buffet, lots of bars and shopping, with an easy walk to the Luxor next door..and that's about the only easy walk, because if you wanna go to any other casino on the strip, you have a hike ahead of you, or an expensive cab ride...because those buses they have on the Strip...SUCK. I really enjoyed my stay here but what would keep me from going back for a few years is its inconvienent location, hence the 4 stars intead of 5.

I spent the same $$$ at this place as I did at L'atelier and got like seven times the amount of food. Of course, it's not really about that, it's about the fact that the steaks are knock-your-socks-off good. We had the Kobe menu, which means that for two people, we got to share two kobe steaks- a filet mignon and a skirt steak- 3 sides, 3 apps, and 3 desserts. Way, way to much food, it was actually freaking us out and we had to ask to have one of the sides removed from our table because we needed to focus our energies on the MEAT. Kobe skirt steak....my second favorite steak, after the cowboy cut i had at Porterhouse NY. Our waiter was really excellent also, very nice guy. I can't wait to come back here and hopefully order more smartly so I can enjoy everything and not pass out face first into my ice cream.

I went here for breakfast, and it was fantastic. Omelette stuffed with shortrib, a generous amount of delicious bacon, brioche instead of the typical toasted white that was the bet bread I ever had...everything was very good and the service was great as well....I lot of people have stated that the service is uneven here, but i guess I had one of the good waiters.

I've been to this buffet three times...breakfast, lunch, and weekend brunch...and it has been consistently top-notch. I have yet to be to any other buffet in vegas because I keep wanting to go here, so I have nothing to compare it with...but I can't see buffets getting much better than this. They have a ton of top quality items that I feel safe eating and knowing I won't be paying for it later. Yes...the Maalox can stay in the travel case for today. A little more $$$ compared to the other buffets...but a better value given the food available...plus its a friggin buffet...you eat til you feel you get your money's worth

I've been putting off writing this review because I had a feeling it would get long....I dined at both RM Upstairs and RM Downstairs on the same trip to Vegas...and they are basically considered seperate restaurants but here they are both listed under RM Seafood. I also want to mention a pretty cool thing that happened....my visit to RM seafood Upstairs was our lat meal in Vegas and we were actually taking a red-eye home that night...a few hours after out final dinner. So I saw Chef Moonen in the restaurant talking to some ladies...maybe an interview?...and I actually overheard him saw he was taking a red-eye to NY...hmmmm...I wondered...same red-eye as us? Sure enough, a few hours later as me and my GF are seated in coach, who comes walking down the aisle but Rick Moonen himself. So we exchanged hellos and we told him we were jut at him restaurant. he said thanks and was nice and seemed pretty cool. He was on his way to NYC for the James beard Awards. At the end of the trip he gave us an in-flight magazine that had an article on HIM in it, which he signed for us! pretty cool! And pretty trippy.  Getting to the actual restaurant reviews...we ate at the downstairs restaurant first...which also has a sushi bar. had a great pork belly roll, super fresh tasting oysters, a crab cake that was okay, and miso-enhanced steak tartare. The highlight was the 16 flavor ice cream tasting game...what a lot of fun! ...(except for the garlic ice cream). we got 12/16 right...not too shabby.  Upstairs was even more impressive...beautiful aesthetics....like a luxury yacht, best service we ever got....super-friendly, glad to have us, and very efficient.,,even gave us a tour of the spotless kitchen. The food almost got overwhelmed by our impression of everything else...but it held its own...and for $65 for a five course tasting menu...the best fine dining deal in Vegas. And the tasting menu is arranged so u have three options including a more luxurious upgrade for each course. we added oysters to start, so we actually got 6 courses...hey, why the hell not? I don't have the energy to go over every detail...so here's what I had.....oysters with meyer lemon, "spider' crab with artichoke and grapefruit....foie gras two ways....walu wrapped in cheery leaf with a mushroom spring roll...rabbit three ways with the best risotto i ever had (morel risotto actually)...and a very whimsical and delicious deconstructed car bomb dessert.....guiness ice cream, bailey's cream, beer suds, chocolate....really cool presentation. They also had this after dinner tea presentation that smoked like dry ice would.   If I would rate both restaurants seperately...I would give downstairs a 4 and upstairs a 5, but I have no problem rounding up in this instance because it really was a lot of fun and a great experience...and thats the most important thing.

I had the pleasure of doing the Michael Mina Cookbook tasting menu with wine paring when I was here. The menu consisted of five courses...  1. Ahi tuna tartare with sesame oil, pine nuts, and a quail egg     - well I love tuna, and I love raw stuff, hence...I love raw tuna...and raw tuna dressed up this way is,well.....the best tuna tartare I've ever had  2.Lobster pot pie     -A minature version of a Mina classic....actually a nice size (served in a ramekin with the pastry baked on top) for a tasting menu, generous amount of lobster, very rich  3.Miso-glazed cod with soba noodles, mushroom dashi, and bok choy     -another variation of the famed Nobu dish...the sweetnes of the miso was well-balanced by the other components of the dish  4.Kobe ribeye with foie gras     - the other courses were nicely portioned...this was a very small portion of what should be the highlight of the meal. 2 ounces at most. very anticlimactic for me. The steak wasn't all that great either.  5.trio of Mina classic desserts     -Rootbeer float with chocolate chip cookie, coconut cheesecake, and something else I can't remember..I apologize for that.   The wine parings were very good, whites for the first three courses (including a very nice Riesling with the tartare), a red, and a desert wine that was too overtly weet for my taste. Service was solid. I would go again.

Came here at the turnover from breakfast to lunch. So the two stars are for breakfast because at least they had made-to-order crepes, which were okay, and I got my hands on some bacon before they took the tray away. Zero stars for the lunch items..they were just plain bad. From now on, bellagio buffet only for me.

This place wasn't high up on my list of places to go to, but my mom wanted to go and it was her birthday trip to Vegas, so...  I have to say, i was pleasantly suprised. Our server was really friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. The wine recommendations he gave were very good and he even gave me information on a wine i wanted to buy on my own. I had a beef carpaccio appetizer that was very good, and a $85 entree that I kinda regret getting...flank steak with foie gras butter and shaved white truffle. It sounded decadent- and it was good- but for $85 it needed to blow me away, and it didn't. The steak was a little chewy and the white truffles, which i never had before, really didnt do it for me. I love black truffles, and white truffles, while more $$$, don't seem to pack the aroma and flavor punch black ones do. We got a complimentary glass of prosecco at the end of our meal, which was a nice touch. It's a shame the Fiamma in NYC closed, i would have liked to have gone there.

My second experience here was more enjoyable than the first time I went over three ago. I think this is due to me being a "pro' at fine dining now and being overwhelmed by the extensive menu the first time, not ordering properly. Yeah, I complained about the prices three years ago..and they are just as outrageous. But the prix fix menus at $78/4 courses or $105/5 courses are pretty good deals, all things considered. I ordered the 4 course and added a seared foie gras at the ridiculous price of $39. It was as good of a slice of seared foie gras as any, but wasn't worth the extra...say $15-19. My gripes end there...as it was a fantastic meal. Everything was delicious...the amuse of foie gras/parmesian/port parfait....the beef cheeks...the pork belly...the aforementioned foie..and the chocolate dessert. Service was exceptional, and I have always been a fan of the sexy red/black decor. Glad I gave this place another go...looking foward to going back.

I very nice place to go for a little caviar and champagne if the slots have been kind to you. And they were not to me, but it was our honeymoon and we wanted to indulge in some caviar. They give you all the condiments too, plus a choice of toast points and blini. Really nice.

I was pleasantly suprised with this buffet...it's not as popular as some others but I think it is a good choice for breakfast at least- which is what my review is based on. I really only like breakfast buffets anyway..and there's only so much you can do with breakfast. As long as a place has good bacon, I'm sold. I think Bayside's spread was only slightly less impressive then Bellagio's breakfast spread (Bellagio has more varieties of smoked fish). One thing that ticked me off was when they started changing over to lunch at 10:30. 10:30! They couldn't wait at least til 10:50? Who wants meatballs and chicken quesidillas at 10:30?!

I really want to like Emeril's food...I really do like the charismatic S.O.B....but this is my third restaurant of his and again I walked out unimpressed. Went for lunch, ordered the most expensive thing on the menu...lobter thermedor...and I ended up with a $40 dish...for lunch mind you..with hardly any lobster, any flavor, and a very unpleasant doughy substance  that I believe was supposed to be the expected flaky pastry that covers the dish but was just plopped unceremoniously into the flavorless muddle of ingredients. The place was dead too, but most of the places in the casinos that do even open for lunch and are considered higher end are dead...obviously this is one that doesnt seem to care about the few that do show up.

I wasn't planning on going to Sushisamba while in Vegas, as we have a few in NYC and I never even bothered going to either of them. But we were wandering around the Venetian/Palazzo and we decided to go for it. What a pleasant suprise...everything was outstanding. There is nothing more fun than ordering a bunch of small plates and trying different things...which is why I love places like this and Julian Serrano...different cuisine...same concept. The aja sauce they give you for the lobster tacquitos is SLAM BANG delicious, the seared kobe small plate was A-ONE, everything else was great also...shrimp tempura, salt and pepper squid, oysters, foie/kobe roll with caviar and gold leaf was actually the weakest dish...I got it just because of the novelty aspect really.

I will begrudgingly give Chef Robuchon's namesake restaurant 4 stars...technically I give it 3.5 but will round up. The service and ambience were outstanding..the food was very good...but by no means life changing. I knew going in how much this would cost and I never bitch about price, no one should because we all should be doing our research before going to a Three Star Michelin establishment. What gets me is how miniscule the portions are. I would understand if it was the 16 course Degustation, but I chose the 6 course. I am fine with small portions and am all about quality over quantity, but I was a little taken aback at what I got for $275 (including $35 supplement for three langoustine ravioli that are $75 a la carte). I can't help but feel I paid mainly for that limo ride they include in the price. But it really was a pleasurable meal and we were treated like royalty by a pampering staff (though towards the end of the meal..they failed to fold up my wife's napkin when she went to the restroom- isnt someone supposed to immediately scurry over and do that?) This was are celebratory dinner as we had just gotten married and it was nice, but I was expecting it to be a Top Three meal and I don't even place it in the Top Ten..and for $900..that is a disappointment in my book. I also think the menu plays it safe..nothing reads exciting. I had studied the menu in the past and drooled and some of the dishes listed, but I have come to the conclusion that summer is the worst time to dine in high end establishments. It's more fun dining next door at L' Atelier.

Had a really wonderful stay here for three nights (stayed one night at Hostelerie Pierre du Calvet- AMAZING!). Prime location right in Old Montreal near the wharfs and St. Lawrence. Beautiful building...room was TINY but evoked a wonderful rustic, romantic, Old-World feel with its exposed brick walls and wood floor. There are wonderful memories from our stay in Montreal,,and the Auberge du Vieux Port is a big part of that, with its charming service and the feelings of warmth and serinity it evoked in me (which is hard to do as any one that knows me will tell you). Montreal is a magical place for me.

Easily in my Top Five Restauarnts..a unique, amazing dining experience in the beautiful city of Montreal. I'm pretty sure our 4  course prix fix meal ended up being 10 with all the add-ons, plus the take home cotton candy and madolines in a chinese take out box. I am used to amuse bouches and after dinner treats, but I have never been to a place where I got a got the worlds tastiest 'cheese cigar' served to me in a humidor in between my app and entree. And then some slices of sashimi right after that (can't remember the fish). The food itself was really great..especially the foie...seared and finished with veal ju and a pinch of coffee, it was a really rich dish...very bold for the chef to serve it like that as opposed to the usually way of serving seared foie with some sort of fruit garnish to offset the richness of the foie. The teaser of a lobster "cappucino" with black truffle left me speechless. My entree of veal cheeks was really good, but maybe a tad less exciting than what came before. Then the parade of desserts...all Ii can say is..wow. And the value for all this food is amazing. I can't wait to come back and do the tasting.

I was looking foward to SAGE for a while; as I was really impressed with the menu. By the time we got to the restaurant at 8, we were feeling the effects of an extremely long travel day....waking up 4 am NY time for our flight in to LV. So I couldn't enjoy this really excellent restaurant's cuisine as much as I wanted to (NOTE TO SELF-DON'T WASTE GOOD RESTAURANTS ON TRAVEL DAYS- STICK WITH BUFFETS).   The sweetbreads and pork belly appetizer I had was one of the best apps i have ever eaten...sweetbreads and pork belly are awesome by themselves, put them together in one dish and you will instantly be transported to Yummyville where everyone is singing and dancing and houses are made of bacon and happiness is abound. Unfortunately, my steak entree quickly negated any appetite I had left as it was chewier than the Michelin Man's ass (not that I ever tried to chew on the Michelin man's ass). The flavor was interesting....salsa verde and black truffle paste...it worked for a few bites then got unpleasant...but that may have more to do with me having to chew each piece 52 times.   We skipped dessert because we were not at 100% as stated before, so i was disappointed that I couldn't indulge in that. The wine I ordered- by the glass- an awesome Burgundy who's name escapes me but i have it written down I think- went well with both the app and entree. The service was top notch...really friendly, polite, and effecient. The setting and ambience is beautiful and we had a great spot..our own cozy booth away from everyone else. Oh yeah, and they have bacon bread.  I def. want to come back here..i give it four stars because I am minusing one for the steak, but I think there are many things on that menu that would push it to five stars.

GREAT lunch at Julian Serrano..me and my fiancee's last meal before leaving LV. Every single thing we put into our gaping maws we loved......lobster gazpacho, goat cheese-stuffed piquillo peppers, fried potatos with chorizo and fried eggs, seafood-saffron rice, bread with tomato and machego cheese, tuna/raspberry skewers, lobster/pineapple skewers....I definetily want to come back for dinner when they have a more extensive menu. The pitcher of sangria we got was $$$$ at 44 bucks, but it was huuuuugge. Service was very good and our server made good recommendations.

While I wouldn't recommend every pretentious hipster foodie come running to Phoenix (not that I would wish that horror on the lovely city of Phoenix- maybe a plague of locusts would be easier to deal with)- there are some great places to eat there. I say "there" because I am from NY and I am here now so there is there. Anyway- I loved it here (there) and went twice in my 6 days in Phoenix. Fantastic tacos- shark, smoked marlin, steak, slow-cooked pork, chicken with mole- most at $3.99 some near $5 but all nicely sized and overflowing with ingredients and deliciousness. The horchata was damned fine also. Love the décor, reminds me of Baby Bo's Cantina in NYC except obviously the food at La Santisima is much better.

An expansive beer list but thats about all it has going for it. The food reads better than it tastes. The 'dirty' chips were a must order based on the ingredients, but  it was so huge it got tiring eating it. Was good though. The foot long kobe dog was all bread and it being kobe made no discernable difference in taste. Service seemed peppy at first but quickly deteriorated..maybe we smelled or something.

If you are a fan of all things offal, as I am, then this is the place for you. Came here for lunch because I couldnt squeeze it in for dinner. They have a more limited menu for lunch, but I started with an amazing spicy lamb tartare with mint and some sort of cheese..all went together so perfectly and harmoniously. My entree was a bit of a let down..it was pig heart and pig liver...liver in any animal has that distinct irony taste, unless its foie, and the heart was too chewy for my liking. It is what it is...not knocking the chef..it was my chioce for ordering it. Dessert was chocolate and pig blood panna cotta...now that kicked some serious rear end. Just enough blood to add even more richness to the chocolate..very creative dessert..loved it. I gave it 4 stars because even though I wasnt crazy about my entree- my app and dessert were great and I would like to go back for dinner whe they have a lot more to offer.

At first our waiter was a bit aloof but he warmed up to us and helped make the night a great one. had deer tartare which was outstanding, followed by a personal favorite- filet with seared foie and black truffle. Dessert was a trio of creme brulees that were all very good .

After dining at e' in May, I was looking foward to eating in the main restaurant that houses e'- Jaleo. Me and my new wife shared I believe nine courses and seven were slam-bang. Chorizo wrapped with crispy potato chips, salmon tartare in cones, bread with tomato and anchovie, dungeoness crab- stuffed piquillo peppers, garlic soup with egg, jamon iberico (the really good stuff from the acorn-fed black-footed pigs- forget the exact Spanish name) are just some of the wonderful food we had there. It was an exciting progression of courses akin to a tasting menu that we shared- for a fraction of the price of a michelin- starred restaurant. With drinks, I'm actually shocked that all this great food and the tip ended up being less than $200.

I loved my dining experience here....every aspect of the meal was first rate. The food, service, and atmosphere all came together to make a truly memorable five star experience. We opted to go with three appetizers and dessert, which I think is the way to go in a place like this because the appetizers are what really stand out on the menu. I had langostine 5 ways, sweetbread, and foie gras 4 ways...so basically i had 12 dishes of food on top of the 5 amue bouches and the dessert. If you order an appetizer like langostine 5 ways...you literally get 5 different plates of langostine placed in front of you...grilled, seared, moussiline, gelee, and tartare. 4/5 were home runs...the weakest was the gelee. The sweetbread ( I LOVE sweetbread) and the foie were great too. dessert was called the "red circle" and was comprised of puff pastry, marzipan, marscapone cream, and one or two other elements I can't recall...but oh boy what a delicious end to the meal. I aked for  wine pairing for each course and the wines were decent, not great. service was efficient and friendly. The setting was very modern and attractive, with a great view from our table by the window. I highly recommend to foodies and people who want to experience something different.

REVIEW #100: e' by Jose Andres.  It is very fitting that e' is my 100th review....a milestone review deserves a special 'reviewee'. From the moment me and my fiancee appeared at the hostess stand outside of Jaleo and she telepathically knew who I was until we floated out in a state of bliss over two and a half hours later...this was by far the most fun I have ever had eating out and I really see this as the future of dining in the U.S.   Every aspect of this experience was first rate...the food, of course, but also the setting (very Alice in Wonderlandish) and the service...our host and hostess Anthony and Stephanie were fantastic and made an amazing meal even more memorable.  There is no way I am going over every course but I would say 80% were hits with a few misses along the way (totally acceptable, especially since we were introducing some new dishes for the very first time that night). My personal favorites were the secreto of iberico pork (the Wagyu of Pork), the apple 'brazo de gitano', crispy chicken skin in escabeche, maine lobster with citrus and jasmine, and 'apples and red wine'.  The weakest dish I thought was actually the first one.."gin and tonic"...which was essentially a molecular liquid nitrogen version of the classic drink that I don't feel was a good intro to the Spanish-themed meal (they should have stuck with the original sangria one).  The wine pairings were okay except fort the sherry we got at the beginning of the meal...this was my first time experiencing sherry and I am not a fan..but the beer, white rioja, and red, as well as the port, were all decent.   I loved the golden tickets we got in the mail, the take home printed menu and book mark (so I can always be reminded I spent $514 on this meal....well worth it and I'd do it again in a heartbeat). And at the meal's conclusion we get to sign the guestbook and write comments for Chef Andres to read...like how awesome he is and how he should win the Nobel Peace Prize for what he's done in bringing happiness to us common folk with his amazing food and restaurants.   Now one thing that puzzles me..me and my fiancee were #693/694...yet I am only the 8th reviewer here on yelp...only 1% of supposedly foodies are reviewing this place on here?!...we need to spread the word people!

Words can not do justice to the beauty of Hostelerie Pierre du Calvet. It is surreal walking inside..like stepping back in time to the 18th century. Why there are no reviews and I am the first is a mystery, but I implore anyone who wants a true "experience' to at least stay here for a night. It is pricey, but worth it. Only 9 rooms (or is it 10?)....and it looks small from the outside, but when you step in and you walk through all the common areas..and all the hidden nooks and crannies..it seems so much bigger. The building itself was built in 1725 and they have much of the antique furniture and artwork from that era...the place is like a museum really..and as quiet as one too. You really feel like you are the only one there. I will be here if go into too much detail...go to the website and look at their pictures.

The only problem with all these food trucks id deciding which one to go to for lunch. And if you know me, I couldn't narrow it down to one, so I hit two- Emerson's Fry Bread and Hey Joe Filipino...both choices I did not regret...but I regret not having enough room in my bloated gut for more.
