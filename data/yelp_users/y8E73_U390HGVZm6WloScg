Still waiting for my pizza. Ordered food. Never came. Called driver. No Call. Called Hungry Howies. Was told to leave the drive a message. Dear hungry howies and all of your employees. Please get an education you useless pieces of scum you try to pass as a human being. Its your job to create easy and efficient customer service. No one expects you to be a 5 star steakhouse but please, like use proper english when like, people call you, and maybe dont suck. Cause you freaking suck. I bet the pizza prolly tastes good but who knows. If i wait a few more hours i might find out! (I wont)

Whatever you are looking for you will find it at El Hefe. Too far from Tempe? That's okay! There is a second location in Old Town Scottadale. Delicious food, whether your taste is burgers or tacos it's all prepared to perfection. Every member of the staff is ridiculously good looking but they are equally as friendly. Come early to eat or later to dance off all of those delicious calories you ate there. You will not be disappointed!
