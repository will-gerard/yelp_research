This place is a great place to eat alone, have a date, meet some friends, or even business. They have greet food, great workers, TV for sports, and even on the weekends live music. KINGofHUD

RA Sushi is telling me they are not willing service bento boxes so we left. What a joke at Ray Road. Fire that manager.... When been going there for years and years. What a joke of a manager. She let us walk out. How hard is it to make our meal.

Doctor Karen Leber is the best. You should expect to wait 30 to 45 minutes. This is true in the medical world. Do you not expect to wait through the entire process from start to finish at a steak shop 30 to 45 minutes to be served even with a reservation. A little waiting time, drink orders, drinks, order your meal, then your meal served. People seem to forget our appointments are our target time to arrive and not to be seen. Dr Leber has only improved with time.   People with reviews sadly are commonly over delighted and wanting to punish somebody at the heat of the moment.  I am simply here looking up her contact information, and saw a review or two I did not like.   Have a Great Day Doc, and I will be calling to schedule a visit.

The steak, egg, and potato burrito is the bomb. I have been eating here forever. I was shocked to not see all five star reviews. I would love to buy a franchise if they franchised.

You sold me a defected dash when I spent $65,000 on my suburban. This cracked in less than three years. It is all over the internet, and you cannot stand behind your product and replace it. Stop buying crap from overseas. I want American made vs American assembled. This was a sad day in the world of Chevy forcing me to join the class act lawsuit against them on this issue. Do what is RIGHT.

Tied for the worse Mexican food I have ever ate. You will find very low quality food. Food should never be served with this low if quality.

This is one of the best experience with anything medical. You can tell Rehl really truly care about you as a human vs as a patient. I hope that makes sense. If you have ENT issues there is no better ENT  doctor in Arizona in my opinion. I have been to other just checkout their reviews vs Rehl's reviews as an ENT.

This pizza is amazing. Amazing is not even good enough to explain it. Just try it. The wings are hot, but the flavor is worth it. If you are on a diet do not even bother, because one slice us not good enough. However, the salads are awesome too.

I cannot tell you the Doctors are bad, but I can tell you the front desk and customer service was a terrible experience at this location. I would use a different ENT location vs this one. I hate writing negative reviews, but this front office was a terrible experience.

A fun place to go. The 347 needs to step their game up on their food quality. I only go there based on local choices. I wish I went there because I craved them.

The best subs in Maricopa. You will go back over and over after trying them. It is not your regular subs.

The food was amazing. Be relaxed while waiting be served. This was my first time here and the lack of attention sucked, but I am glad I stayed.

I would rather eat at subway, and clearly I would rather eat at firehouse subs. There is nothing special about these subs.
