Yum, I love this place. Great sack lunch special. The bug juice is delicious! The fresh baked bread is soooo good. The current staff can sometimes be dickholes but I am still gonna give them 5 stars cuz it's all about the food!

I have always enjoyed this restaurant since coming here as a child. Occasionally they will do a champaign Sunday brunch, that is definitely the way to go.

I love this little place, good drinks, decent happy hour and they always play weird old movies. Bartenders are all pretty cool too

Recently visited this jeweler to have a ring resized. Was quoted a resize at $80, then $85 when I brought it in to drop off. Furthermore, the gentleman told me that he keeps any gold he removes as that is included in his price.  Upon shopping around, I was able to get the ring sized and rhodium plated for $40 bucks out the door! It looks beautiful and I felt much better dealing with someone who was straight from the start.

Wow, what a gem!!! Great poolside bar at the Palomar hotel in downtown Phoenix. Amazing views and service....The unbreakable force, known as JeffEverett, will serve you some libations that will literally, blow your mind! Be fourth warned, you will not regret this decision!

Cool new place in Arrowhood! Finally something different for lunch. That hot fresh Fry bread is sooooo good. Tried the carne Asada and green pork....both were bomb.com!!! The desert was super good, I had enough to share. Side note; They need to start jarring that salsa bcuz I am in love.

Wow, definitely some of the best pizza in the valley! Tuesdays are 1/2 priced bottles of wine. Make sure to try the traditional pizzas!

Wow, this place is a hidden Gem...pun intended!  Recently visited another jeweler to have a wedding ring resized. Was quoted a resize at $80, then $85 when I brought it in to drop off. Furthermore, the owner told me that he keeps any gold he removes as that is included in his price quote.  I came to Fine Jewelry repair at the referral from a friend in the industry. The staff was amazing and I was able to get the ring sized and rhodium plated for half of what I was quoted elsewhere! It looks beautiful and I am glad to deal with a a company that was straight forward from the start!  Thanks again Fine Jewelry Repair!
