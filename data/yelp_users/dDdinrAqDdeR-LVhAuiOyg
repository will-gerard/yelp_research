When I am in AZ, I have come to a particular place outside of a sports venue. Usually, I am in AZ for a Dodgers vs D'backs Game. During those non-Dodger Days, I like to travel about 20 minutes east of Phoenix to one of the most authentic swap meets at the Mesa Market Place Swap Meet.  Unlike what I am used to Los Angeles, Mesa Market Place Swap Meet is one of those swap meets that you will want to keep coming back for more. In Los Angeles, I just want to grab what I am looking for and leave. Mesa Market Place has a huge parking lot. I wouldn't be surprised if Mesa Market would expand another aisle and possibly branch out to do automotive items. It would be something different. Probably do window tints or install aftermarket items.  You will find all sorts of items you would see on eBay and find them here. Whether its cell phone cases, luggages to statutes or cooking demonstration, you will have a lot of fun walking down four aisles. Oh yeah, Mesa Market serves $3 Beers! That is a very BIG PLUS! You can walk down the aisles and drink or sit down and listen to some singing. I definitely got some Chicken Tender & Fries after shopping around. You'll probably get full from getting the freebie trail mixes from the multiple stores that offer them for free.  When you are visiting Phoenix, definitely stop by Mesa Market Place. Not all shopping has to be done at the widely invaded Wal-Mart or at the mall, but sometimes the swap meet is the cool place to be. I can't believe my one month supply of trail mixes is almost gone in two days. I have to go back and make sure I buy a year supply for a weeks worth :)  Yelp!

This review is for 06/11/2011. After a failed attempt to find something to do, my GPS told me about the Biltmore. I had no idea what it was, but it was located in a busy business area of Phoenix. To my surprise, I was...SURPRISED. If Beverly Hills/Rodeo Drive had to relocate, it would be here at Biltmore Fashion Park.   This is a very classy place. It is a combination of an outlet mall meets Beverly Hills. There is free parking on the north side of the mall. However, if you are eating in you can park in the south side with, I think, two hour validation. There is valet service as well. I parked on the garage because of the heat and the shade would provide some level of comfort when I returned.   I parked on the second floor which was a mistake because I walked in one of the most expensive stores at the Biltmore, Saks Fifth Avenue. By simply walking in, I had declared bankruptcy a couple times over. There was a lot of female associates waiting to take your credit card. Glad I walked fast out of there.   I walked the center of the mall and it was calm feeling. A lot of people were just sitting outside while the water mists were filling the property. It was so damn relaxing there. I took a walk around and decided....I think I need a drink. I found a Biltmore Guide and wasn't familiar with a lot of the stores. I saw something called Black Chile Mexican Grill and I knew that this place was a guaranteed win for drinks. That will be on another review.   The Biltmore is simply amazing. I met a new friend here at Black Chile Mexican Grill and had an amazing time here. I won't be buying any clothes here, but I will grab a drink again if I am here in town. What a wonderful place!!

Since I was coming over to Glendale, AZ for Baseball Spring Training, I had to book a hotel for three days. I didn't really care where I was going to stay. So, I used Priceline's Bid System and with the low price I submitted, I was going to stay at the Crossland Economy Studios.   I wasn't going to use the hotel that much since I was going to see the Los Angeles Dodgers at Camelback Ranch. So, this place was perfect to just sleep and go. Prices will vary when you stay here. I forgot to take a photo of this place, but its on McDowell and 51st Ave. It is a three floor hotel or an apartment. Why I said that?! Well, it seems like it was made as an apartment versus a hotel. The elevator button was missing for a bit on the third floor.   The room is simple with a small electric stove, sink, and microwave. I didn't have tub, just a shower with a seat. For some reason, my room had some strawberry jelly all over the place. Not sure what that was about. Someone didn't clean the place thoroughly. Also, I noticed that every time I left the room and come back many hours later, I noticed the bathroom was a little wet, but major. So, there are some plumbing issues here. TV is very standard and room has an AC...COVERED WITH STRAWBERRY-COLOR'd type jelly. I swear it was all over the room.  There plenty of fast food places you can eat at that are just walking distance from the hotel: Sonics, McDonalds, and etc. If you are collecting trash, please note that housekeeping does charge. There are trash bins near the stairwells to dump the trash.   Office Hours are from 630am to 10pm. I had to leave a bit early, but there is a phone just outside the office to call the front desk. There isn't much to complain since I had already known that it was going to happen. If you don't plan to use your room often and save $$$$, then this is a place to stay.   Yelp is my Review, My Story, and My Life. It's time to share it.

This review is for 06/11/2011. Don't worry, I will write my review for Black Chile Mexican Grill later. I only have a couple hours left in Phoenix and I had to make the most of it. It was the best final decision for the night and stay. I was staying over in Phoenix most of the time and I didn't realize Scottsdale was next door. Well, ON FORWARD to COACH HOUSE!!  I arrived around 7:30pm. From the outside, it looked like a horse stable. The parking lot is unpaved and seems like something from Roadhouse than it did Coach House. There two bouncers at the entrance and they will swipe your ID for verification. I have no idea what the drinking laws are for Phoenix, AZ. It was a bit quiet here, but it would pick up in an hour.  I met an Asian bartender named Aaron. The first Asian I have seen in Phoenix in a long time. He was a cool guy. I asked him about their drink special and he said, "Cranberry Vodka". My favorite drink. Coach House was not cheap about their drinks. When they pour their drinks, they give you the best for your buck. Cranberry Vodka was only $4.50. I had a few...lol.   I met a few new friends here and we talked. It was wonderful to be at a local hangout. I feel I belong here. There were TVs here, but I only watched for a few minutes before someone was chatting with me. On a hot day, the water mist is on and it feels much cooler to be there. This was an amazing place to be on my last evening with a few hours left.   I am thinking about moving out here. Stress of Los Angeles can shorten your life and Phoenix can give you a fresh mind....Well...unless the Coach House gets to you. :) Now knowing a classmate lives around here, I'll make sure to come back in this direction again.

WOOHOO!!! RIO!!! I love this place. You don't need Dubai or make a city the center of Las Vegas, you just need to make customers happy.  I am here, right now, for a Video Poker Tournament and MMA XPlosion Fight Event. My friends will arrive early Saturday morning and I think I am going to enjoy this hotel room to myself. Since I am in the tournament, I am staying and got a $50 for free.   I got a nice view of the Pool Area and the freeway and strip. The only problem I have is the Ice Machine. The Ice Machine is broken. Its hot outside and NO ICE. I will have to knock off a star. I am on the Impanema Tower. Not sure what the other tower is called, but that's the building you see from the freeway. I am resting comfortably. Its a big suite, but I don't know what a classification of a sweet is these days.  Umm, I checked in about 11am and I was surprised they let me in early. Some hotels you have to wait until 4pm. So, I will add back the star for a PERFECT 5 STAR. You made me not wait in the heat.   Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!  Small Update (07-18-10): They fixed the Ice Machine...lol..It should be 6 Stars Now...lol..

Although Caesars Palace is the Flagship of Harrah's Properties, this is the busiest and most popular of all Harrah's Properties. It pays better than most other properties and has a lot of events going on here.  They have a lot of slot machines and restaurants packed in one small property, but they do it much better than most other casinos. Larger properties doesn't mean better, but Cluttered means a little more business. They have a great Rewards Center and got $50 Rewards for free, plus 15,000 Points to purchase.....NICE...  Today is St. Patrick's Day and I have a feeling its going to be very crowded with drunks. Oh boy....Wish me luck today!! Although, you may be reading this a long while later..lol  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

FIVE STAR YELP RATING EQUALS FIVE STAR SERVICE!!! Yesterday, June 21 was my birthday. Turning 25 gives you special upgrades at a casino that cares. Where to celebrate your 25th than Harrah's Las Vegas. I had my choice of staying at Rio, Caesars Palace, Paris, Ballys, but I wanted to stay at the name of where it all started, Harrah's.   The parking is still rugged, but you'll notice there is a lot of cameras for security. It may look like the Sahara's, but this is a much more popular site. Hotel Registration had a LONG LINE. Either this was a popular place to stay or something went wrong. However, service went fast since there was a lot of hotel clerks on hand. As of June 22, the Diamond Lounge is out-of-order, but you guys will get First Priority Service. Wyndham Vacation Services took over the lounge on the second floor. I think they are relocating it or already have relocated it right at the Valet/Hotel Registration Entrance.  The wait in the line was about 10 minutes, but it was moving very fast. I was greeted by May, a Filipino Hotel Representative. She noticed that it was my birthday when I checked in. Originally, I had a free Classic Room, but she upgraded me to a much better room in the Carnival Towers on the 32nd floor (out of 35 floors) Room 37. The room was AMAZING!! Either it was Mini-Suite or just a damn looking Classic Room. (Picture Posted as a Panoramic on June 22, 2010)  The bed was King Size, the view is OK, but whose here to look out the window. TV is the old type, but again, who is watching TV in Vegas. The one thing that stands out is the BATHROOM. The bathroom has a sauna and a jet stream bath. I tried the sauna for the first time and damn..I want one now. The sauna can go up to 120 Degree Fahrenheit. The bathtub has it's own windows to show the bedroom. Kinda kinky in a way. Its like watching your neighbor take a bath. DON'T DO IT THOUGH...lol.  I am grateful to Harrah's for giving me this wonderful room on my birthday stay. Whether or not I am a Club Member, you make me feel valued. Thank you Harrah's and hope to stay at Harrah's in the future.  Will Have Lots of Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

Circus Circus is now a Freak Show. I remember coming here a lot as a kid, but now things have changed so much. They really need to update the place or become a casualty to new hotels such as the Encore, City Center and Planet Hollywood.   Parking Garage 1 is the the worst. At least Sahara Parking Garage has lots of space, but its ridiculous to find every floor full and people fighting for parking. There are footprints all over the place. Why do people do that in the parking garage? One Elevator? There was like 50 people waiting for a small elevator. Geez..No supply and High Demand.  When you walk in, its like SPAM. All these marketing and promotions for their stores. If I am going to spend something, I would do it at the Miracle Mile Shops or Caesars Palace. Things have changed so much. I think Excalibur does a much better job than this place. I am not sure if MGM Resorts are paying attention to this place.  Did not Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

Out of all of Las Vegas, Wynn Hotel is the Ultimate Experience in class and experience. I remember coming here in 2005 and know, right there and then, that this hotel will be forever be special. Steve Wynn created most of Las Vegas and he dang deserves his own hotel. Not even Trump Hotel that is across the street can outshine the true Mr. Las Vegas.   Wynn was hosting the Pacquiao vs Margarito Fight and out all of the hotels, this would be the place to be. The fight was in Texas, but most knew that Pacquiao's real fight home was in Vegas. Wynn and the Encore can accommodate a large party, but I am still not sure if they can host a Fight Night Event. Mandalay Bay & MGM usually gets the big events.  Right now, I am sticking with Harrah's Brand. If you are a millionaire/billionaire, then come here. Bellagio...pffssh....Wynn knows Las Vegas even better than MGM tries to do with CityCenter. I wonder what the next hotel name would be called...Wynn..Encore...(?????)  The Yelp Universe. Where are you traveling today?

This review is for 07/16/2011. It looks like I have entered enemy territory once again. Last time it was at Angel Stadium, now I have entered the home of the Arizona Diamondbacks, but the one thing I love about the enemy is their home base called, Chase Field.   I arrived to area around 4:15pm. It is the most majestic way of having multiple arenas in one spot. This should be a lesson for the next Los Angeles type city. I am not sure if Chase Field has their own parking, but there are plenty of parking spots in all directions. You can pay from $5 to $15 for parking spots. I found one just across the street for $9.   There were a lot of Dodger Fans and glad I didn't feel like I was alone. Chase Field is AMAZING!! The exterior felt like it was some haven from sort of nuclear holocaust. The entrance was fast and easy. If you don't have a bag, you can enter through a faster line and get your ticket scanned fast.   Once you walk in, you can see the beautiful field. This was a perfect spot to hold the All-Star 2011 Game. Seats in the 100 Sections were quite long. I was seat at Section 134 Row 29 Seat 1. It was one long section and there was a lot of foot traffic. That somewhat ruined the experience. It was like the 405 Carmageddon followed me.   As for food/drinks, unlike Angels and Dodgers, there were a lot of staff selling food from rice krispies to beer in a bottle. I went to one of the food stands and just got myself a large bottle of water ($6) and Craker Jacks ($2.75). I would have gotten beer, but I have been drinking most of the day. :)   One thing I did notice Chase Field did somewhat lack was the sound. The sound was mainly at the Chase Field screen. I would like to know what it would sound like if the sound exploded through the stadium. With the roof closed, it was 78 degrees with outside being 108. I work in the construction industry and kudos to the air conditioning company who was able to get the air circulated for this big space. I would like to have seen the roof open, but the air would take awhile to cool.  Chase Field was amazing!! I know Seattle Mariners' Safeco Field is the next quest for my baseball visit. I still got SF Giants' AT&T Park, San Diego's PetCo Park, and Oakland A's O.co Coliseum. I am having fun despite Dodgers losing every time I go to a game. Oh well, its America's National Past-Time. Glad to be making my journey of visiting MLB Teams' stadiums.  The Yelp Universe. Where are you traveling today?

BEST DAMN BURGERS on the strip!! After our convention ended for the day, my boss and I wanted to get something to eat after all the activities. The location of the Burger Bar is between Luxor and Mandalay Bay at the Mandalay Place Mall. I wasn't sure what to expect, but sure was great my boss wanted to go here. I was supposed to go here last November, but my plans had switched because of the Pacquiao fight.  We were greeted by a beautiful lady and placed on the tables near the entrance because the booths were full. My boss wanted to see the Football game, but at the same time have a great meal with our work money. I opened up the menu and I see this expensive $60 burger. Foie Gras Burger...What?! Geez. I ordered the American Classic with skinny fries ($14). I am not sure what my boss ordered since it was a customized burger, but sure was delicious for both of us. I guess I am willing to pay $14 for a burger, but not a dime more.  The atmosphere was awesome and people were just having fun watching the game either with the MLB or NFL. The American Classic Burger is a MUST!!! One day...I will order the Foie Gras Burger...just need to win $60 bucks.....  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

This review is for 11/13/2010. After deciding to go to Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet, I just had to figure out where the heck it is. I know...I know...its on Flamingo Road, but I just don't know what the design of the building looks like since Aria, Caesars Palace have distinctive designs. How old is Flamingo?   I had trouble finding the parking lot many times. I circled the building twice and entered Imperial Palace's parking garage by accident and got stuck in it. I finally found the garage, but I was so lost where the elevators were. POOR SIGNAGE!!! I made a mistake and accidentally found a sweet spot near the elevator. The parking garage is not connected to the casino, so you will have to cross the driveway where the cabs are waiting. My mom thought she saw a woman from Designing Women waiting for her limo or ride. I think it was a TV show. Oh well, I am not familiar, but I guess you will bump to someone from the past in Vegas.  We walked in and wow...bright and shiny like the casino was brand new. The smell of coffee in the air and all the shiny floors and railings. Looks old on the outside, but definitely cool in the inside. I didn't have my Total Rewards Card, so I headed straight there to get it. Unlike Harrah's Casino, this TR area was small. Only 3 people working on a small booth type area. I got my card and I was in and out fast before the Platinum's got theirs.   I saw a lot of Filipino workers here. Geez...With Pacquiao's fight, I swear it was a Public Relations ploy to get Pacquiao supporters to stay at Harrah's Brand instead of MGM. On the way to the buffet, I, actually, saw FLAMINGOS!!!! Why didn't I take a picture?! It was weird to see a pink bird just walking around the patio area. Now I am thinking of Suzanne Somers from Three's Company.   Overall, the casino looks better than Sahara, but the bathroom might need some upgrades since I had trouble trying to get out of the stall...lol. My leg blocked the way out. Parking Garage and accessibility is a little confusing since you have to enter from the back through the alley. Would I return?.....I will say...Yes.   The Yelp Universe.

One of the greatest hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. To add to my trip...its a BUSINESS TRIP. I get Per Diem and I get paid to attend. Woot. I am glad to be exhibiting Mandalay Bay  Convention Center and stay at Mandalay Bay Hotel.   This review may not be lengthy due to the fact that I was there for 3 days and no way I am going to do step by step, but I will do my best. My boss and I arrived at Mandalay Bay around 12:30. We had to go check in with the convention center to drop off our cargo for the show. The convention center has many floors with many ballrooms. I won't state what convention due to security reasons, but there are a lot of business people attending at various floors. There are 3 floors, but each floor has like thousands of ballrooms.   After we checked in, our hotel agent, Jessica, was very lovely. She joked around with my boss and tried with me, but I was serious about having my boss getting a key for my room. Thank you Jessica for our stay. Both my boss and I got got separate rooms for the 11th floor. I'll upload my photos, but there are 460 reviews...I think you know its a great hotel.  The hotel overall is wonderful except when it rains with lightning. Great thing our convention and room was under one hotel. The Convention staff helped us from Day 1 to the end. Food from the Mandalay Staff was AWESOME and I swear they spent over millions of dollars for our convention. Met great staff like the Security Agent Alicia. Alicia joked with me from not having my badge to not having talked to her. Sweet lady!!  Overall...you would forget that you were in Las Vegas, except the fact that you hear people shouting and slot machines making noises every second. I'll be back in Vegas for my mother's birthday. I didn't win this time, but lets see about next month. :)  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

I am a VIP Member here and this buffet stinks. I would prefer the Caravan Cafe over this. $8.99 with a Club Card...No Thanks!! All their food seem to be reheated from the previous day. I eat one piece of food and I am done. Every time I go to the Sahara Club Window, they keep asking me if I want a Buffet Coupon, I just say "No, Thanks!!". Its just awful.   Orleans' French Market Buffet has better food and price without the Club Card and they are far from the strip. I'll save my comps for rooms and the Caravan Cafe.   It seems that their Buffet is situated in a former Poker Room or Gambling Room and right next to a Studio or Showroom. Its so far away from the entrance that its not even worth it.   I highly recommend you to stay away as a VIP Sahara Member. If you have no taste palettes, go eat away. I have been going to the Sahara for two-three years and it tastes bad. Go to the Nascar Cafe...eat the B3 Burrito and its yours free...or go to the Caravan Cafe and actually eat something.   Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

This review is for 07/16/2011. After leaving the Well, I had to eat up before the Arizona Diamondbacks vs Los Angeles Dodgers game at Chase Field. On my previous visit to Scottsdale, I drove by the Fashion Square Mall a couple times, but I never got to visit. With the help of Yelp, I found the Yard House.  I arrived around 12:30 to a nice part of the Fashion Square Mall. I don't know the exact location of the Yard House, but I know its around the valet service that the mall provides. The location where the Yard House felt like I was in Las Vegas, but it seemed that way. This Yard House vibe was excellent.   I walked in and sat at the bar since I was alone. I was greeted by Steve and ordered a Cape Cod ($8.75 each) right of the bat. Yeah, I love my Cape Cods. Steve used Ketel One Vodka ($8.25) with Cranberry ($0.50). I can't believe they had to break the price down on my receipt. I was very hungry and I got ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken ($16.95).   The wait for the food was about ten minutes. It is my second time to ever be at Yard House and I am still surprised to see so many drinks served on tap, but a lot of the drinks were sold out and had to be served by can. I finished my Cape Cod and ordered another one. Too much for one day?  My food came and I, immediately, smelled the mushrooms. No, not that those mushrooms. The chicken was very crusty, but the sauce definitely complimented the crusted chicken like it was butta. Awesomely delicious. Steve had to take a break and I had a female bartender. We stroke a small conversation and Steve came back. Sorry about that....I was starting to have fun with the talk. My total came out to be $37.54.  I had to go in and out fast to get ready to get to Chase Field, but with my stressful morning and celebrating at a dive bar to eating at a restaurant, half of my day came out to be just a perfect morning. Glad that this place was next to my hotel, but like an Angeleno, I drove instead of walk.

Since I was headed to Phoenix for Dodgers Spring Training, one of my supervisors recommended me to visit a couple places. One was a casino and the other was a BBQ joint. Right after Game 2 between the Dodgers vs Chicago White Sox at Camelback Ranch, I headed over to Famous Dave's in Peoria.  Well, I didn't know this Famous Dave's was located right across the San Diego Padres' and Seattle Mariners' Peoria Sports Complex. Before you walk in, the parking lot is filled with advertisement from the portable grills, trucks, and the piggish look of the exterior of the building. When I walked in, it was around 3:30 p.m. I was taken to the bar area since the crowd was very light and the game at the Peoria Sports Complex had not finished.  My waitress for the day was the beautiful, Victoria. I didn't tell her that because she had a ring on and I didn't want to get her in trouble. She might get in trouble now since I just posted this review. Sorry Victoria! Well, I was told to try the BBQ Pork, but I saw the Famous Dave's Daily Special, but before I ordered my meal, I saw the Spiked Berry Lemonade ($7.50). Go order one and try it out. Its a MUST!  It was time to order and on Friday's Famous Dave's Special, it was the Sweetwater Catfish Plate ($9.99). It comes with a corn muffin, and two choices of sides. I chose Famous Fries and Dave's Cheesy Mac and Cheese. While I waited, Victoria brought some complimentary Famous Dave's BBQ Chips. Oh my, this was different. It was DELICIOUS! I am not sure if the BBQ chips are house made or brought in, but it was very good. I wish I asked for seconds, but my main entree came on time.  I saw the deep-fried catfish tenders and I was ready to dip it in the sauce. Again, with me being hungry, I neglected the fact that it just came out of the fryer and I just put half of a tender in my mouth. Yeah, it burned! With the help of the Spiked Berry Lemonade, it cooled me down, but I had ran out and asked Victoria to give me a small Bud Light ($2). Glad it was cheap since I came in during Happy Hour. The catfish was delicious and pieces were quite big. Unfortunately, I used so much of the sauce, I didn't notice that there were 4-5 different BBQ sauces next to me.  Since, I did not order any meat, I tried the BBQ sauces and it truly complimented my meal. Whether it was for the catfish tenders, the french fries, and even the corn muffin. I tired the regular to sweet BBQ sauce. Oh yeah, the macaroni cheese! Now, there was something special about the macaroni cheese. Oh, there was some corn in it. I swear corn makes the meal delicious. Like I always mention, the saddest part of the meal is finishing it.  Victoria was great and drew some hearts on my check and receipt. I would have joked more with her, but the ring part was a strong part that I would not dare interfere. She is cool, but her service was great! Oh, I might have to send some Los Angeles Dodgers neon lights since the maintenance staff was putting up some San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners signs. We'll have to change that next time I visit.  Do you think I write too much? Well, you can call me a Yelp-O-Holic!

Awesome spot to relax after losing at the poker tables. I was just walking out of the Poker Room to get fresh air and I hear Green Day type music. I walk further out and DAMN...there was a lot of people.  Carnaval Court Bar & Grill is not just the stage and bar, but its like a big-small carnaval...lol. I just got sodas, in which, I forgot what the price was, but it was very reasonable. I don't usually stay for concerts, but the band was great on 10/7/2010 evening. A lot of people who were having fun and having a drink.  Harrah's is my brand of hotel. I only stay at MGM if someone else pays for it. Harrah's had great entertainment and great place to just relax. Sorry I couldn't write much, but I think you should just see for yourself in Vegas.  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

This review is for 06/11/2011. Well, I got my things done earlier in the day and I had to visit one of Phoenix's malls. My GPS told me about the MetroCenter Mall. It looked big on the GPS and I decided to that way. Maybe it was a mistake to head this way....  I arrived to the MetroCenter Mall around 10am after a busy morning doing some errands. Since I am an L.A. Guy, most malls are always full of cars. All I saw was nothing..A BIG NOTHING. There were a few cars, but the parking lot was HUGE. I thought this area was infected by zombies or something. Then, logic kicked in and I knew the economy had to be an issue. The mall seems like a place, in the past, where it was a watering hole for the locals. Now, it is dead quiet.  I walked in at the SportsChalet side and it was confirmed. It was dead quiet. It was quiet and a lot of the stores are empty and closed. The only thing going on around there was the food stores, a couple kiosks, and a lot of sports apparel stores. Really?! It was depressing inside. I am not even sure why this mall is even running.  I walked up to a Customer Service Desk and asked of things to do. I was given great advice by the lady. She is the only reason why I didn't give the mall a One-Star Rating. She gave me some activities to do, but I didn't get to do any of them because of my time frame. After asking her, I continued on to nothing.   When you think of a mall, you think of lots of activity, but this is just one big million dollar nothing. How is this business even running? There is a theme park next door, but that is also quiet. It was a weird feeling, but reality kicks in and you know you are witnessing how the economy is affecting business. Oh wow, there is nothing really to do here. The only time it will get busy is Christmas when temporary shops set up and sell. Time to leave this void and hopefully it will be better, if I return.

I wondered why my dad took me here several years ago. Its because its cheap and almost a good competition to Rio's World Buffet. I think the price is $8 per person for lunch. I did not have a Orleans Club Card, but $8 is a deal. The Sahara Hotel has $8.99 Buffet with a Card, but with the Orleans, you probably would save $1 or $2. I remember my total was around $16. Very Good Deal!!  They had Salad, Mexican or Tex-Mex Station, Chinese Station, American, Italian, and their own big Dessert Station. I mainly went to American Station since I always fall in love with Mac N Cheese. I had sandwiches, and bunch of other Americana stuff. They had a lot of food, but I only had three plates. Like my headline says...I am a Big Guy, but I don't eat a lot.  Orleans is away from the strip, but somewhat is small scaled version of the Rio. Orleans has their French Market Buffet and Rio has their World Buffet. If you are on a budget and not wait a long line...go to the Orleans. Its pretty cheap for lunch without a Club Card and food is better than the Sahara Buffet and probably as close to the Rio Buffet without the high price.   Lunch Ends around 3:30pm. Not sure what time Dinner starts during the weekdays. Very reasonable and not too crowded, but the food is very good and not seem too be mass-produced.  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

Ever since visiting Chase Field a couple years ago, I had always taken my vehicle to watch the ballgame. Although traffic is not as bad as Los Angeles, I just wanted to relax to and from my games. The Valley Metro Light Rail is the perfect way to get to and from Downtown Phoenix.  For just $4, you can get an All Day Pass and travel on the rail. I am not sure if the Day Pass works for the buses as well. Most of the time, I park my vehicle at the Montebello & 19th Station near the Christown Spectrum Mall. There are very few stations with Park & Ride Lots that you can use.   The Light Rail Trains (LRT) are very interesting. Although the doors are closed, you just press a button to open the door and walk into a very COOL and well maintained air conditioned train. With a lot of transients, it was very hard to to see any graffiti or any damage inside the train. That shows you that Valley Metro takes care of their trains. There are bicycle racks on the train to provide space on board the trains. However, it can get too packed on very busy days  The LRT stops at the important stops such as malls, airport, and more importantly for me, Chase Field for any baseball game. Whether you are watching the Phoenix Suns Game or Arizona Diamondbacks Game, the LRT will get you there faster and cheaper. If you are waiting at LRT Station, there are some parts of the station that there is a button. That button is an AC Cooler. It is very interesting. Just push the button and you can be cool for a few moments. I like how Valley Metro is thinking for their customers and making sure they are cool on hot days.   Like my Dodger Games, I try to take the train whether its in Atlanta, Los Angeles, or Phoenix, I've got to experience how other people get to their games. I want to tryout the New York Games and see how people get to their games on packed subway cars to the Mets or Yankees Game. Like our motto in Los Angeles, this should apply to all public transportation system, "Go Metro!"  Yelp! The One Stop Place For Your Everyday Research!

Ugh...I guess Vegas never wanted me to leave. I was driving on the I-15 at 3am and I was about 3 miles from Goldstrike Casino in Jean, NV and something black on the freeway disabled my front left tire and I was on my rim....Now I know how it feels when a police car sets up those stopsticks on those chases.   I called my insurance company and they sent me a guy to replace my torn tire with a spare tire. I searched Yelp Las Vegas and I found this place. The tow truck driver also recommended this place as well. I drove 25 miles back to Vegas with my spare tire and it was just embarrassing.  I arrived and it was 24 HOURS!! WHAT?! I don't believe it. So, I drove in and they went to fix my car right away. It took them 15 min and I was ready. I guess Tire Service is a VERY GOOD demand and I am glad they are open especially at 5am. I just wanted to go home. They charged me $40 for my tire and I was off back to Los Angeles.   This morning, it was a wake up call I am a big guy, but I was scared as heck. Getting a flat tire on the I-15 and at 3am is just something no one should ever be in. My rim is probably damaged since my steering is very tense and I might need to see another place, but I am glad to be HOME!!  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

This review is for 10/17/2010. After unloading at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, my boss and I went to a local gas station. I recommended this shop because I have been here many times and the deals were better than most of the shops on the strip.  There are two Terrible Herbst. I prefer the Terrible on the south side. I have never been to the north side. Apparently, there is a training center next door. How convenient....train for one day and work right next door. This Terrible brand is never Terrible except when it comes to paying....  I bought a Coca-Cola ($2) and a Arrowhead Water ($0.69). My total was $2.69. Quite a difference when you don't pay the CA CRV. When I tried to pay, my CC was not going through, but when I paid with my Debit. It works. Hmmm...I guess they want you to use some guaranteed form of payment...lol.  Location is great and just perfect spot just before going back to Los Angeles. I'll be going back in November. Lets see about going to the north Terrible.   Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

This review is for 07/16/2011. After a busy morning driving from Los Angeles at 8pm to arriving to Scottsdale at 3am and business at 6am to 9am. I had to celebrate. This is my second time being in the Scottsdale area. The streets were starting to look familiar, but unfortunately, I don't know the bars and laws. I used my trusty Yelp site to help me find a local dive bar near my hotel called, The Well.   Apparently, the Well opens at 6am and closes at 2am. Wow, I don't know what the rules of serving alcohol, but freaking sweet to know I have a certain place to go. I arrived around 10:15am and it was very quiet location. I met some new friends here, but I won't mention their names for security reasons. I was there for a good two hours having a good time chatting with the local Scottsdale residents.   I had three Cape Cods, but one of the people I met with paid for another one. So, I had four of them. It was $3 for one Cape Cod. It was a decent mix, but heck, it was worth it. The place was dying quite a bit and even the owner mentioned how slow business was going. The owner even gave himself a vodka drink right after starting his shift. Cool type of owner. However, this location was far from the scenes were the college students usually hang around. That may be hurting business for the owner.   I met some new friends in Scottsdale and a lot of the pressure was lifted off of me. Probably because of the drink, but I did have a meaningful two hours. It is a cool place to be. You can hang out in the water mist, in the lounge area with HDTVs or at the bar, but you'll get a lot of friendly people who know each other like they were coworkers. I am surprised no one stays the whole day at their cheap prices.  The Yelp Universe. Where are you traveling today?

I am a VIP Member here, but to the other hotels (MGMMirage & Harrahs Entertainment) I am chump change. I earn a lot of COMPS and free hotel rooms at the Sahara. Sahara is the last of the old Dynasty chains of the Rat Pack Hotels. Sahara has the best deals in town in some retrospect.  The Caravan Cafe is a 24 hour Cafe in the Sahara Casino right across the Poker Room. I did not dine in, but I did take it to go since I was hungry at 3am and wanted to eat in my room. I thought of the Cafe as a Denny's maybe Denny's got their idea from the Caravan, but the food was superb.  I ordered a Sahara Burger ($8.95) and a Turkey Club ($8.50 or $8.95) Instead of Fries, I had Cole Slaw and Potato Salad. Don't forget that they do charge for Order Out. I think its $1.50. However, if you have a Club Sahara Card, I think they waive the charge. I think my total was $20.48, but since I used my Club Sahara Card, they waived the $1.50 and it was around $18 to $19 that they took off my comps. All I remember was the cashier saying that she would take something about $2 less than what I saw on the receipt.  The Sahara Burger was meaty and delicious especially with the Cole Slaw. My friend had the Turkey Club and it was just as good. Although I think my friend wanted the Cole Slaw, so we exchanged the Potato Salad..lol..  Peter was my waiter and he served me very well while I waited for my togo order. Since my food was free, I gave him a $5 tip for watching over me (Giving me something to drink, making sure I'm ok) He even gave me some extra stuff that would've normally been charged.  In the end, its just a diner/cafe. I just needed something to eat without traveling outside of the hotel. Nothing really special and really soothing to eat in without the crowds. It may be the oldest hotel on the strip, but it still has a lot values for visitors.  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

What are you doing Sahara?! Now the Caravan Cafe is open from 7am to 11pm only? I used to go at 3am on a Tuesday morning and now you have limited hours?! I am surprised, but now I am quite concerned about the future of Sahara.   After a failed attempt at going to The Orleans for a very cheap great quality buffet, the next choice was the Caravan Cafe where my meals are free. The previous night, I was shocked to know about the relocation and reorganization of the Caravan Cafe and very disappointed. Paco's Bar & Grill was the previous location before Caravan moved in.   Well, lets get straight to the food and move away from the negatives. I am not sure about the prices since I have a lot of comps and didn't worry about the prices. I did order the Corn Beef Hash & Eggs (Sunny Side-Up) with Wheat bread for $8.25 I believe with the Sahara Club Card and I think it was $9.75 without. The Corn Beef Hash was below average to average. I swear they were conserving too much cause I ate it fast before I finished it. The eggs were OK, nothing spectacular.   The setting was too small. The other customers were literally just an arms length apart. I didn't feel comfortable in there now. So much has changed in here and I am not sure I am going to like what Sahara will do. Hopefully, they can move it back and make it 24 hours all week.   Hope You Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

This review is for 11/13/2010.  I lost majority of my receipts and I managed to just get this out of my bag. As many of you know, I am a Vegas lover. Who isn't?! I got a BOGO offer from Harrah's to tryout any of their properties buffet. I wanted to try something different. With my mom's birthday at hand, I decided to go to Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet for the breakfast buffet.   When we arrived at the restaurant area, there was a lot of people lined up. However, it was for the Tropical Breeze Cafe. When we walked a little bit to Paradise Garden Buffet, there was another line, but it was for special guests...lol. I guess Special Guests were treated like normal customers. So, I went to the regular line and in seconds I was at a cashier while the others waited in line for minutes.   I was greeted by Brenda. I gave her my Total Rewards Card, my coupon, my ID, and my credit card. Wow...that's a lot to give for food. Apparently, we came in during Champagne Brunch. Since it was just my mom and me, the total would have been $52.00. Whoa...$52 for two...Don't forget my coupon. My total would be $27.01. It would be $24.99 per person for Champagne Brunch.  When you do pay, they ask what you would like to drink. Its not extra charge, but its just a way to get servers tips since there is no soda fountain. We were seated by Marilou or Mary Lou and OFF TO GET FOOD!!! OMG, they had shrimp and mussels. I knew I had to fill me up. I got my eggs, sausage, this weird looking egg muffin that had no bread on top, but bread on the bottom, salmon, and hash browns. I got another plate and filled it with shrimp and mussels. YUMMO!!!  Best meal of the day. Unfortunately, my mother and I didn't take advantage of the free champagne since we don't drink. The shrimp and the mussels were the best part of the meal. It was like I was a whale and just ate the whole Pacific Ocean. Meal is a little pricey, but we are nowhere near the ocean and there was life here at a casino that seems like it was falling apart. Plus, the coupon help pay for my Mom's Birthday...lol.  The Yelp Universe. Where are you traveling today?

I wanted to see if this place still had the same service and quality since i was a kid. After going through a barrage of marketing and families, our group saw the Circus Buffet Sign only to be seeing a HUGE LINE for just BREAKFAST.   It wasn't a zig zag line, it was just 3 lines and it was short...lol. I noticed that a lot of people are getting a day pass or the All You Can Eat Pass...lol. Geez...talk about Gluttony in the City of Sin. We had four in our party ($10.49 per person) with the 8.1% Sales Tax. Our total was $45.36.  After you pay, you are seated and off you go. There are two sides and the both serve the same things, but from what I heard, breakfast is the best time to go. I got myself eggs, sausages, corn hash, sausage patties, pancake wrapped pie, bacon, and anything breakfast. They had a drink section which is larger than their breakfast area. They had different kinds of milk to sodas..lol. I guess hydration is more important.  One plate of food had done it for me. I got fruit, but it didn't help. It was like they added MSG or something to make you get full fast. Oh well, it was a good breakfast, but wasn't average breakfast. I would like to have seen more or even include Brunch since we came in at 1030am.   Hope you Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

This review is for 07/16/2011. After my Dodgers lost at Chase Field, I got hungry and I didn't have a lot of time left before I had to head back to Los Angeles. I wanted to see a couple of the party scene areas. I found a couple of hot spots near my hotel which is like Club Town. I found the Lodge.   I arrived around 9:30pm to a party scene. There were tons of cabs and lots of women ready to party like there was no tomorrow. Parking is quite difficult, but being an Angeleno, I used my car to drive just a couple blocks from my hotel. I did find a street parking spot and glad I did before it got too crowded.   The Lodge does ID checks and the guy was quite friendly and welcomed me. I walk in and it was filled with more women than guys. I just wanted to grab something to eat and drink, but WOW. I got extremely nervous especially when there are lots of women. I headed straight to the bar and got my favorite drink, Cape Cod ($5). Then I closed my tab and headed towards the dining area.   I sat down in the nice lounge/dining area. I was greeted by Brittany. She was a gorgeous doll and fast on my service. When I ordered food, the one item that got my attention was the Sasquatch Burger ($16). It was like a burger but as for the buns, it was replaced with two Grilled cheese sandwiches on the top and bottom. I had to order the specialty. Brittany was on top of me when she passed by (That's what she said). I would point to her and she knew what drink I needed. I got two Cape Cods during my meal. My total was $28.50  Ten minutes later....I got this huge plate of potato fries and this humongous sandwich or burger. I couldn't even give this a classification. I had no idea how to eat it. Eat the grilled cheese sandwich top bun first, or slice into it. I mean, you would have to cut it down unless you have one big mouth. The Sasquatch burger was damn amazing. You'll have to look at the photos that other Yelpers posted. I did finish by the way. I left the crust of the Texas Bread out because after all that drinking, I might have passed out from food coma and drinking :)  After I was done, Brittany chatted with me and wished me safe travels back to Los Angeles. Again, she made sure I was OK before I left. I gave her a nice tip for checking up on me more than the other guests. That Sasquatch Burger was just overwhelming. I think I gained 5-6 lbs from it and with the multiple Cape Cods through the day, I am not even sure that I ate it.  The environment was quite clubby, but there was no fee to get in. There were a few military guys in there, but the ladies didn't even go for them. There were some older guys in there trying to be all arrogant and badass, but to me, they were just trying to impress the ladies. I miss this place already, but I am not sure my stomach wants to try the Sasquatch Burger very soon...Give me a year....  The Yelp Universe. Where are you traveling today?

After many...MANY MONTHS, its almost time for DODGER BASEBALL!! From October to mid-February, I had to fill my sports appetite with basketball. When I got an e-mail from the Dodgers to register for tickets for Spring Training.....I WAS ON my A-GAME. I have visited Dodgers Stadium and Isotopes Park. I can finally mark, Camelback Ranch off my list.  I attended the first three games of the 2013 Spring Training Seasons with the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs. The first game was going to have the most crowd because of everyone showing up including the NEW owners from the Guggenheim Partners. Camelback Ranch is quite new and very scenic. It is home, not just for the Dodgers, but to the Chicago White Sox.   Access to Camelback Ranch is very easy and FREE PARKING! You have multiple ways to access the park: Straight into the stadium or take a very beautiful walk to the training fields. Bags will be checked. The big item is the water bottle. Only 1 Liter, but they may let it slide if you have more. No Can Sodas! I had tons of baseballs and they were wondering if I was going to throw all of them in the field. Nah, just purely for autographs. It would be funny if I did, but I would be banned.   The landscape is just marvelous with a canal running through and the multiple fields for other teams. You can watch the pitchers, major hitters, and/or watch players work on their techniques. You can try to grab players autographs behind the metal fence and some of them will slip by you. So, you better be READY!  After you are done watching the players, you can enter the park. You can re-enter the park if you need to. They will exit your ticket and re-enter it in their system. There is a team store for both the Dodgers and White Sox. The park is so clean, you wouldn't realize you were there for a game...until you hear the announcer call the players. I've had front row seats on the Dodgers Side and got a couple of Dodgers Autograph.   There is an All-You-Can-Eat Patio Section on the left field. It is much more classier than the All You Can Eat Pavilion at Dodger Stadium. I had great views of the Dodger Legend, Sandy Koufax and current Dodger Pitchers. You have the basic items: hot dogs, chips, popcorn, and peanuts with soda. I ate so much that I didn't even have room for ice cream....Until the next day that is....lol.  I've met a couple people at Dodger Stadium such as Dean who is an user at Section 27, Stephanie, one of the security at the gate, Melissa, host at the All You Can Eat Patio, and Jose, another host at the All You Can Eat Patio. Without these wonderful people who represent, not just the Dodgers, but Camelback Ranch, the experience wouldn't be the same. It would feel like the old Dodger Days and I am sure a lot of you don't want those days to come back.  Dodger Stadium, Isotopes Park, and Camelback Ranch are just simply amazing. I've had great moments at every baseball venue and I...SO...can't wait to go back. April 1st is the Dodger Home Opener and can't wait for those words: It's Time for Dodger Baseball!  Yelp is my Review, My Story, and My Life. It's time to share it.

Whoa...Aliante is far out there, but this casino is the most beautiful I have ever seen. Almost fitting that this is the true Las Vegas Casino in a desert. Why was I out here, when there was other major casinos? Well, I have to thank a friend for making me drive out there.   We were going to have a small reunion at this buffet and like I said, it was beautiful. This buffet is a combination of The Orleans French Market Buffet with Rio's World Buffet. The right price and elegant decor. The Feast Buffet has six stations (Asian, Tex-Mex, BBQ, American and Italian). Mainly, I was on the American, Tex-Mex, and BBQ).   OMG...They had Mac n' Cheese, my favorite. I had two to three plates of the magnificent comfort food. They had sub sandwiches which I took a lot of..lol. On to the Tex-Mex, uh-oh, I shouldn't have gotten it, because the meat was right off the stove that it burned my mouth..OUCH!! Finally was the BBQ section. Oh man, there was a lot of Back Back Ribs with a similar smell of Tony Roma's...I only got a plate of it.   There was one station that I forgot to get....THE DESSERT Station. After eating all that food, I was full!! So, I just got fruits (cantaloupe, watermelon, and grapes) To top off the trip, the Executive Chef came by and made sure we were doing fine. Now, that's class. In any history of a buffet that I have been to, I have never had an Executive Chef come to pay a visit. Now that's CLASS.   I don't have any figures since I didn't pay for the meal, but my friend did use her Station Boarding Pass for lunch. Looks like it was around $9.99 with the BP. This casino is a little far, but it sure is very classy in the middle of nowhere.   Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!

When I am in Arizona, its usually because I am there for a Dodger game. With my busy day at Camelback Ranch, one of my supervisors had suggested going to a casino in Scottsdale. I wasn't aware there was one and should have visited before. Glad I found one of the luxurious casinos in Arizona called Talking Stick.  At the hotel I was staying, there were pamphlets for Harrah's AK-Chin and Talking Sticks. When I saw Talking Sticks, I had to pay a visit and try out my luck. I had arrived on a Thursday Evening and it was crowded. I had realized when I got back to work that Nascar was in town when I paid a visit. Thus, explains why the huge parking lot still seemed small.   As I mentioned, the parking lot is huge! Walking to the casino is very easy. Lots of lights and paved pathways to the casino. Plenty of parking for small cars to huge RVs. I wasn't sure if I was walking to a casino or I was going to work at night. Valet areas are elegant and the entrances are just as magnificent.  I walked in and it was loud. Machines ringing, people shouting, and lot of music playing. There is a huge poker room with lots of people throwing money on the table. I wasn't able to dine at Talking Sticks since I was busy gambling. There are a lot of servers going around making sure you are good and spending more $$$$. You'll find Blackjack, Poker tables, and many different denominations of slot machines. I even made sure I signed up for the Player Rewards Club. I was hoping to get a free buffet one day :)  Talking Sticks was a very high class casino and probably is and was a better option than Harrah's AK-Chin. I had a nice chat with a girl that was next to me, but I wish I hadn't left my chair to get more money and she was gone. I wasn't sure if she was Lady Luck or just me pretending I was talking to someone. I didn't win at the casinos, but I did have a fun experience. I hope to get some freebies from Talking Stick when I come back.  Do you think I write too much? Well, you can call me a Yelp-O-Holic!

During my last couple of hours on my random trip to Arizona, I had attended two Arizona Diamondbacks vs San Francisco Giants Game (Don't ask me why I attended this non-Dodger game), I was curious if Arizona had a drive-in theatre. With the help of Yelp, I found the WestWind Glendale 9 Drive-In Theatre.  It was about 630pm when I used my Yelp App to find the WestWind Glendale 9 Drive-In Theatre. It was still bright outside, but the place was already open. I was one of the few people already entering in. I was greeted by one of the staff. Since I was the only person in the large vehicle, the lady didn't bother to inspect my truck for any other people unlike other locations. Admission is $6.75 per person. The lady told me a lot of people drive across Arizona to come to visit this drive-In theatre.  This location is near an industrial area and railroad tracks, but not close to the movie theatre. During the weekends at noon, WestWind also serves as a Swap Meet. I wish I was there to experience that like my younger days. I saw some pamphlets that there are some concerts at the WestWind. With a huge lot, I wonder if this location host an event like Coachella!  Since I've seen most of the movies already, I just wanted to experience the drive-in theatre. I watched, "The World's End" and "Two Guns" at Theatre 9. When I parked my truck, I parked it as I would park between the lanes while the other cars parked wherever. I think I may have blocked some views and spaces, but I was far away. Sorry! The quality of the sound and picture was OUTSTANDING! It was like I was at the movie theatre, but in my truck. With all the other people's radio out loud, the sound was spectacular and echoed throughout the lot. I wish I had my Dodger lawn chair and sit in front of my truck.   While you wait for the 1st or next movie, you can head to concession area and grab some popcorn, drinks or ice cream. I grabbed a King Cone Ice Cream ($6.95) since it was really hot and it definitely hit the spot. I miss going to the concession stands, but do be careful when you walk during the dark. You might step on trash and slip. There are plenty of trash can bins and still don't understand why there are tons of trash.  I have visited a couple of California's, Georgia's, and now Arizona's Drive-In Theatre. I think this is one of my new list to do in my life. If I see a drive-in theatre, then it is a must to do. I wish there were more these days. Just going to one of these drive-in theatre is a lot of fun and much more enjoyable than a modern movie theatre.  Yelp!

After a long day watching the Dodgers at Camelback Ranch and watching a movie at the Glendale Drive-In, you'll get hungry! With me being hundreds of miles away from Los Angeles, there is no better place to grab a late night snack than at In-N-Out in Phoenix.  Located on the shopping center with Michael's and Staples on 28th & Peoria, you'll find SoCal's famous In-N-Out in Arizona. A couple hours earlier, there was a car crash and on that intersection and tons of local law enforcement. When I came back around 12am, there were a lot of Arizona Highway Patrol cars at the In-N-Out. It looks like a lot of them were taking their break. There were even more when I left. I didn't eat in since there were more coming in. I guess you can call this a temporary HQ for the Arizona Highway Patrol.  It had been awhile since I ate anything at In-N-Out. So, I ordered what I use to order: a 3x3 Burger ($4.35) with everything on it and Animal Style French Fries ($3.50). I didn't realize that the Animal Fries was put into the microwave with the cheese. If I have to describe what it tastes like, then you really need to add In-N-Out to your bucket list.   Yeah, there are tons of Sonic locations, but if there is an In-N-Out, you know where my priorities lie! I still dream of a 100x100 challenge, but I am not sure if I want to add that to my things to do. Maybe I'll keep trying out more of their not-so secret menu.  Do you think I write too much? Well, you can call me a Yelp-O-Holic!

This review is for 06/11/2011. This review is dedicated to the awesome new bartender friend, Brooke. After a long day in Phoenix, I had to find some good spots in the area. I haven't touched alcohol in about a month. Why not start it in another state and still say that I haven't touch alcohol in CA. Let's head on over to the Biltmore Fashion Park and dine at the Black Chile Mexican Grill.   This place is a close resemblance to El Torito, but a little more classier. Black Chile Mexican Restaurant is at good spot and after reading the other reviews, its a NEW restaurant as well. I walked in and a friend's tip was to always head towards the bar. So, I did. When I got to the counter, there was no one there. I wasn't sure if the place serving anything at 11am. Then again, I don't know Arizona's law on serving alcohol.  The bar section is quite lovely. One side of the bar is in the interior and the other side is on the patio side. Plus, the water mist made it even seem you are at the beachfront when you are in downtown. Then a few minutes later, a female bartender named Brooke came on over and got me started with my order. I started with my drink of choice, Cranberry Vodka ($6.50). She also offered some complimentary fresh chips and salsa while I contemplated on what I was going to devour for my meal. While I was waiting, some kids were asking for some olives on a stick. Wow...you got some future martini drinkers in the future. Those kids would come back every 10 minutes for olive and/or a pick stick.  After downing my Cranberry Vodka, I came to order the Chicken Chimichanga ($12.96) with hot, spicy sauce....Oh did I forget, I ordered another Cranberry Vodka. Since I did not have long stay in Phoenix, I asked my bartender friend on places to visit for the next 6-8 hours I have got left. Well, she did her job and gave all the great spots which were in the neighboring Scottsdale. Unfortunately, I never got to do them because of time-constraints.   About 10 minutes after I ordered, my Chicken Chimichanga came in and I had already finished my second Cranberry Vodka. Blast it!! My body does want alcohol after a hiatus. So, I saw the Margarita Glass and asked for their house special on Margarita. Brooke gave me a taste sample on the frozen margarita and it was pretty good. So, I ordered their house Black Chile Margarita ($9). That drink was awesome and complimented my meal quite well.  The Chicken Chimichanga came with beans and rice with the hot green sauce on the plate. The dish was right out of the kitchen and it was pretty hot and quite spicy. Not too spicy, but enough to give me a tear. I forgot what the name of the bottle of hot sauce she gave me, but I think it was Cholula. I am a Tapatio guy, but it was good enough to add more heat. I finished my meal and the margarita was taking its toll on me....LITERALLY. Glad Brooke got my back and got some more fresh chips to balance me.   Well, it was getting close to 12:30pm and I had to close my bill. I didn't have enough time in Phoenix to do enough. Brooke closed me out and my total was $36.15. Before I left, I had to use the restroom. The restroom is downstairs and there was a nice little lobby/waiting room down there. Almost thought I accidentally found a VIP area.   Before I left, being the bartender friend that she is, she watched out for me and gave me a glass of water without me even asking. **This sounds awfully familiar from another friend** She gave me the list of places to stop by, but time was one thing that was not on my side. Black Chile Mexican Restaurant was amazing and glad to have found it. I believe this is the last review for Phoenix and I hope to be back in the future. One day in Phoenix to get away from Los Angeles is not enough, but sure was worth it.  The Yelp Universe. Where are you traveling today?
