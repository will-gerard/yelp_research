I came here for some sausage for the holidays. If you like big, long sausages then you'll love this place! And you can smell this place from the outside. The smell of smoked Kielbasa lures you in. The store is non stop for the holidays but bring cash or check as no debit or credit are accepted. At Best of Europe you hear Eastern Europeans speaking in their native tongue, see the facial features of those of whose ethnic ancestry are similar to mine, those scooping up the traditional Christmas foods of herring, kielbasa, havarti cheese wih dill, smoked mackerel, pickles, sauerkraut, homemade rye bread, sardines from Scottland. This place is clean and organized. Traditional foods for Christmas or Easter is a great time to celebrate with Best of Europe, try the rest of the wonderful deli meats and cheeses during the rest of the year!

Dr.Ric Rios is the best;  he has prescribed contacts and glasses for me and my family for many years. I just wish the office  wasn't so far away from my frequent destinations. It would also be great to see if he has more updated frames, I currently like the French designer Koali made in Australia.

Best place to get a watch battery changed, have your jewelry repaired or buy second hand beautiful and unique jewelry. Don't be fooled by the other jewelers who want to charge you more money if you own a Movado or other high end watch, the competitor's  18-25 dollar batteries don't last any longer  and DO NOT affect the timing! Many Rolex owners discovered this gem of a place. They also have the add a pearl necklaces with the pearls sold separately. Nancy is a struggling business woman who has a kind heart! Don't be dismayed by the lack of fancy furniture in the shop, the work is quality.

Sorry, but I've been to this store in the past and although the assortment is beautiful, it is too pricey. Repairs are super pricey! I would recommend N&R gold and Silver across the street next to Micheal's, they're much less expensive.

I was just at this salon yesterday and I was not impressed. I live in FHills but shop in Scottsdale and because they are open a bit longer than salons in FHills, I went. I called to see if they would accept competitors coupons and they said yes- NOT TRUE.  First off, the colors were outdated and looked watered down. The water in the tub was luke warm. Since I was new, I requested a plain pedicure and was charged $25. I gave her the Cindy and Danny's spa pedicure coupon for $19 and the woman owner said that they only accept the discount equivalent to what their coupon is at $22. For that money minus tip, I could have gotten a mint scrub, hot towel massage and beautiful colors.  We are in a recession, if they think that they have a such a superior service to offer for a foot bath with clipped toenails and paint, I'd rather give the money and tip to a salon that really appreciates my business and wants me to come back.

I have worked and lived near this place for many years and remember when it first opened. They used to advertise lunch specials and happy hour to get customers in the door and oddly I never heard any comments about it until YELP.  With so many great compliments in Yelp, my hubby and I decided to give it a try.  We ordered the calamari to start and it was very delicately done but not much of it.  They have mackerel but it is called spanish mackerel--it was still very good.  We enjoyed a tasty assortment of sushi that was beautifully presented.   My only gruff is that the sushi crab is the fake Krab, but at least they note it on the menu.

A packed restaurant in the middle of the afternoon, now I know why. they have great food, good prices and beer that doesn't give you a headache. The wait staff was very nice, attentive, young girls with new breast enhancement (why don't they wait until they're older and have a few kids first? If you young ladies are reading and want to know the reality... You have to pay $10 grand to have them redone in 7-10 years and they take the breast tissue that adheres to the implant with it.)  You cant see the kitchen, I tried to peak around the corner to see how clean the floor was and the kitchen looked small so I hope it was clean. (didn't see them on dirty dining.)  Fish and chips is great, calamari is as good as a coastal restaurant, and the black bean and SWestern rolls were very well made with a nice light dipping sauce.  Out running errands, stop in for the food and beer.

I was shocked that I could get good take out of dine in Chinese food so close to home! I was lucky to have had fast service on this busy weekday. The special was Pine nut shrimp and it was excellent. A nice amount of shrimp, albeit they were probably farm raised in Thailand, and great assortment of vegetables other than onions! It came with a few crispy things and a side of soup. The hot and sour was just right and had nicely chopped small amount of veggies in it too.

This man is great, he is accommodating and finishes when he said the work will be done. His prices are fair and his work is quality. I will drive all of the way there from Fountain Hills for all of my cobbler needs.  Scottsdale shoe repairmen need to get a heads up--they charge too much and the wait is too long!

I don't know who would be so hard up to purchase these 80's looking, too high priced, cheap clothing from the tight wad who owns this place.  I went in to sell  a two season past, hip, light gray cashmere Oscar de la Renta twin set  that was in excellent condition and they wanted to give me $8! I asked to speak with the manager and the owner was there and she told me that I can take my business elsewhere after I told her that she was crazy for asking $30 for a long length, highly padded blazer from the 80's. I asked anyone in the store if they wanted to make me an offer on the way out. I'm glad that I donated it to a place where she can't get her hands on my things---The owner most likely sends her staff to Goodwill to stock her store.

My husband and I were the only Caucasian Hispanic couple in the joint so I guess we got the visitors (non-ethic related) plate--one that was bland, skimpy, cold and had a hair in it.  I can't help but to notice that the BAD food is for the Gringos.   Sunday was busy, we dressed casually and got the the bad joke about my hubby's t-shirt from the waiter. There were plenty of casual exercise wearing families there. I would have been very upset had I felt like I dressed for a special occasion and received this Extremely Bad Food.   Big deal on the decor, the inside looks like an over the top gaudy and old fashioned ethnic restaurant. My husband and I would have rather eaten at a fast food (forbidden for us) restaurant!   Lamb was a cheaply cut, marinated in water and pounded to separate the grizzle. A measly 4- 1 inch pieces that aren't even 1 inch solid chucks of meat.  Seriously, I can cook Persian food MUCH better.  The plate made the portions look large.    The service was fast but the portions misleading and a TOTAL ripp off.  The waiter never checked on us.   And how do you eat chunks of raw onion with basil and bread? Who wants to be around someone after eating raw onions--GROSS!   I would give this zero stars but the yogurt dip was the only good thing.  PS: Groupon sucks for carrying this crap

They have the best herb filled and parmesan sausage around, not fatty and all flavor. The sandwiches rock, the groceries sort of pricey. It may take an extra 10 min or so wait but this is not subway. Good value too. Expected them to have an excellent giardineria in a jar, it is still good on a sandwich but AJ's has the best and I could eat it out of the jar plain!

Food is great and prices are comparable. I get the Vegas and the Caterpillar rolls and they are tasty. The signature drink is good and you can tell they are not watering it down. You have to try the Kobe sliders- deelish. I don't care if they use ground turkey, they are so good and the pickles and sauteed onions that come with it are excellent!

The food and drink are appreciatively foreign and artfully presented. The atmosphere was nice but I couldn't hear any music and this would have made for a more enlivened atmosphere. Menu choices are a great selection of meat and seafood. I had the yellow fun tuna and it was fantastic. The yellow rice that accompanied the tuna was unique but I would have have served half the rice along a few asparagus or something.  Veggies and potato are a la carte and you'll need them to feel like a complete meal. I would recommend ordering the lamb medium well and nor medium rare. A groupon would have been smart.  Desserts were  fantastic and also offered in the lobby of the Westin and look scrumptious; however they are uncovered and open to those who sneeze and cough.

Cindy and Danny have moved back to Cali to be closer to their family...  But the new owner(s) are doing a very nice job and a great deal--and you can put gratuity on the debit card!  I've been here many times before and always have a great experience. The  other technicians in Fountain Hills  massage my calves so hard that it hurts! The nail technician gave me a nice foot massage and knew to stop scrubbing my very sensitive and ticklish feet when I squirmed.   The music that they play is very soothing. I like the hot towel in winter and warm lotion....aaahhh, relaxing.  See you in a few weeks for some festive color, purple today, glittery gold for good luck in the new year!

Never ever had a problem (knock on wood) and I have used many different drycleaning services all over town. I've been to some places that have trashed party dresses and lost things and not compensated properly. I had my silk wedding dress cleaned at Prestige, they claim that they can take any stain out if they know what it was from but they are too pricey, request additional pay for a redo if they missed a stain, and don't have the convenient hours that Delia's has. Delia's workers are very nice and Anthony is an exceptional employee (no I'm not related to him or know him personally) he is professional, smart about the business and very helpful.

Brunch is exceptional, try the eggs benedict they are delicious. Sliders were excellent. Cheese, meat and olive tray- wonderful.  Mimosas and Bloody Marys are perfect with the noon menu. Pricey, but worth it. Great service.

It has been about 3 years since I last visited and it took me this long and a few people to say good things about them before I could return. My last visit was reminiscent of cheaply made sushi and bland food. The green tea fried ice cream was terrible.  Just last Sunday I had a wonderful experience and the place was nearly packed to full capacity. The happy hour had a few great items and they also have specials that are written on the boards. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing.  Dont miss the surf sushi or the lollipop. I'll be returning next week to enjoy other interesting sounding items like pork and ahi sliders.

a Groupon turned me onto this cute Aveda salon, otherwise I would never had known about it. My stylist did a great job of haircut and color. My only complaint is that the owner(s) are most likely asking the stylists to up-sell, because I was told that I'd need a second cup of color for $15. In all of the years getting my hair done, there has always been color left in the bowl. I did notice that the amount of activator and color in the cup was mixed in a much smaller quantity. Everyone wants to make a little more money in the down economy,  I'm happy to pass it on to a hard working stylist.

Very nice interior. I Love the bar with oyster shooters and the deli and lobster tank!  I'm aware of what fish have the highest mercury, which are substituted and which are lying low on the overfished list. I know what water areas are most polluted and which are not.   I WANT to know the country of origin my fish is from and whether it is wild caught, sustainable or farmed. When I'm paying for something with my own money I make informative decisions and want to know exactly what I'm getting.     They serve the EXACT fish that they have on the menu--NO Substitutes. I think that the majority of consumers aren't aware that restaurants AND grocery stores can serve fill-ins or substitutes for the actual fish and essentially lie about what they are serving. Yeah thanks to our lazy and corrupt USDA.   Excellent service from our male waiter--the best I've ever had!

Sorry, but don't waste your money or time. I needed to have my Coach sunglasses tweaked and went to see if they could help. The glasses kept falling off my head and the guy worker, who is apparently just the repairman, told me that he could tighten the screws and replace the nose pads with some silicone pads but I would have to leave them there and come back in an hour or two! What the hell? It was hot and I must have been dehydrated because he said that it would cost $20 for each pair. After driving about two blocks, I turned back around and picked them up. Silicone pads are usually only a few bucks and the Coach have their emblem on the pads, so he would have removed the nice ones and replaced with cheaper ones. All that he should have done was narrow the bridge with the needle nose pliers. The inside of this place is very unattractive. I don't know if the owner was booted out of his house and is living in the store, but he has all of his family photos in the store.

Ambiance: I liked that they have a stage, upbeat music, happy hour and you can see the kitchen.  Re: Good looking staff:  We had a handsome waiter, the other young ladies are just average looking.  The chairs had worn out cushions and i sank in them.   The food was good but a few discrepancies on the menu:  The Butternut squash Cannelloni  is actually Ravioli! Do you reviewers not know the difference? And there was supposed to be corn, white asparagus and sugar snap or snow peas with included but were missing--they would have added to the overall taste, value and nutrition of the menu.   Appetizers: ordered the mussels and got a great portion with a wonderful broth and superb toasty bread for dipping. A few of the mussels had an off taste though.   Also a port cheese from France which I thought would have a port wine swirl through it but it was very tasty. Served with a berry jam, I would have preferred a crushed olive dipper. (for $4 I can't complain.) Desert: carmel corn custard something or other, more than for one person. It was more sweet than an expected sweet and salty.   Shared the entire meal and it came to 51.and change. Good deal for 2 ladies who are watching their calorie intake and want something different.   Will be back for appetizers and happy hour.  Of note: Again, I am a seasoned fish and chipper-- please serve malt vinegar at the table when serving. The coleslaw looked very healthy, not  mushy.

I really don't like to give bad scores, but I received an email today from this organization and it jogged my lackluster experience and prompted me to write this review. I made a phone call early in February this year to have my veins examined, mainly for cosmetic reasons  Warning: The Google listing for this place is incorrect and so is this Yelp listing. The correct address is: 8962 E. Desert Cove #110                   Scottsdale, AZ 85260  The office staff MUST forewarn clients about the address and provide location directions. Also, the office staff needs to verify your email address and let you know that you will be sent and email from them AND mention that if you DO NOT receive the email within the next day, to call them back--because likely the person who does intake likely forgot to ask for the email address or wrote it down incorrectly!  It appears that the doctor likes to surround himself with lots of young ladies, regardless of their training or desire to resolve a problem in a friendly manner with a new client, such as myself. The vein doctor appeared competent and kind, however, I don't need to have my veins stripped, all I needed was a few minor injections.  So here it is, June, 5 mos after my visit, which at my exit I told them that I will not be returning.  Perhaps the office got a new office manager?

I have eaten Peruvian food in Costa Rica and this is comparable but with smaller portions. The flavors and smells were enticing. The service was excellent. The ceviche dinner was perfect. I had a 1/4 of chicken with an incredibly addictive spiced rice, some thinly sliced cucumbers and red onions and a side of Yuka, that serves two, served with a cilantro sauce that I could have drank plain it was so tasty. They have a South American cola but it has high fructose corn syrup as an ingredient. Listening and watching Andrea Bocelli video in Spain es mui romantica. I want to see some neighboring flavors of Uruguay and Argentina, grain  fed beef (sold at Sprouts) free range chicken and anything with chimichuri, please.

Looking forward to starting a new great job next week means that I'll be super busy for the next 2-3 weeks so having a good manicure and pedicure prior is necessary.  I chose to do a shellac french tip after trying the gel. My technician did an absolutely beautiful creation. All 3 of the ladies are very nice and the atmosphere is very cozy and fun. The place was booked non stop and there was a little bit of a wait but not any hassle. The cost is a few dollars more but worth while. The pedi does not have the whirlpools or massage chairs but I don't mind since there have been so many discussions in the past about local salons not being clean. I will definitely return to this salon.

Maria did a nice job on the trim, blending in my long layers allowing my hair grow back to its pre chemo length! A pretty blow out and pleasant conversation and a smoking deal to boot. They are open after work hours.  My uber fashion conscious niece gets her hair cut here and it looks much better than the time she dropped $50 at Taglio,  Go, go, go now and get you hair trimed up, you never know when that interview is going to happen and you'll have time to practice the Star process with a neutral party.

I have eaten at both and love the one in the Quarter's atmosphere.  Surprised to see overweight wait staff in light of the healthy food served--Now they can get an education on nutrition and chase tables to become fit!  Most of the food served on the menu is stuff that I can purchase at Whole Foods and make on my own at home, however, the lasagna was awesome and a few other dishes that take time to create are worth indulging in.   I think Dr. Weil is Overrated and a hefty no-exercise pontificate, but it's a Fox Concept restaurant and I think they all about big business with lots of money. What are they doing about creating a greener environment?   I prefer to spread my earnings to independent small businesses. Too bad someone cannot succeed or create what you see in the organic and clean ingredient restaurants that are commonplace in California. Hmmm, I may just have a business plan after I finish paying the student loans...

I have been here a few times after an afternoon shop at the Promenade and have enjoyed the happy hour that is from 3-7. The service is very good.  I had the mackerel dinner and it was great!  The miso soup is delicious and the dressing on the side salad is very good.  I think if the sushi were prepared with more veggies, like carrot or cucumber slices incorporated in some of the choices, then it would bring the quality up a notch and I'd frequent much more often.  The quality and quantity is very good for the money. The decor is nice for a strip mall restaurant and can be interesting to look at.  Yume means dream in Japanese.

Went with a groupon in hand but have been here before The prices are a tad higher than others, I don't think $4 for an Lipton Iced tea or a watered down Green tea are worth it, so got a Kirin. The place has a limited dinner menu, sushi is mostly ordered.  I had the battered shrimp and calamari and it was great.  My hubby asks every Japanese restaurant we go in if they have this item with an egg and beef over rice, he used to eat years ago in Japan and they didn't make it.  Anyone know what dish I'm speaking of?

Conveniently located to my office, I was able to pick up a California veggie Panini within 5 mins at 1:30. The taste and presentation were delicious. Heads up that they are currently listed and available for purchase on restaurant.com. The woman who works there refused my coupon, a man relented and explained that he tried to resolve the erroneous listing with the site several times.

Since there's not  much going on in Downtown Mesa, I'm going up and down the Main street strip and critiquing all! (I'm still working at the Health care facility and Mesa--and looking--if anyone has an opening please let me know!!! I need to work FT hours and conduct my college internship somewhere a bit more progressive! plz msg me)  Ordered the special of the day: Orgeat 12 oz  latte for 3.25 and a vegan choc peppermint scone and it was very good! They have a seletion of bagel sandwiches too and will return to try! They score high for having agava syrup  Suggestions to business: Clean glass and door of messy hand prints Post cost of food in case (muffins at $1.50 would move faster than $2) Get some better framing for musician pictures and hang more aesthetically, organized not mishap, around sofa area.

Hidden gem, but right off the express way, so all those returning back to north Scottsdale have no excuse to not swing by and give this wonderful place a try. The waitress Shana was very attentive and sincere, the owner stops by to make sure everything is fine. Very hospitable. The music selection was fun and upbeat!   The owner knows how to run a business: Clean, very attractive asian decor and sports mix. Black table linens and white cloth napkins, along with lovely heavy silverware makes it feel upscale. And of course, a jersey of Yao's on the wall!   The food is better than Jade Palace, Flos and PF Changs, and what a deal. Happy hour and lunch specials can't be beat! I ordered the shrimp Kung pao with lots of good veggies and the heat did not overwhelm the dish, nor did the sauce take away from the flavor of the shrimp. It has been so long since I ate somewhere and could actually taste the flavor of the shrimp until today!  The egg drop soup was great and my husband's dish of shrimp and rice was very filling, flavorful and healthy!  I'd eat here more often but I live and work in Fountain Hills. The locals business employees need to check this place out!

I've had peels before but nothing like the deep sensitive peel that made my skin as soft as a baby's butt! Lauretta is a seasoned professional with a cute office. She made me feel totally comfortable and at ease with my skin issues. I wish that I could afford to go each month, I'm checking to see if I can buy another groupon to prevent my skin from the rosacea problems.

For the longest time this theater was closed and now it has a whole new look, name and appeal!  I bought the groupon and enjoyed The Wolf  so much with the not too sweet raspberry lemonade that came with the $5 ticket/ When the groupon came on again I was right on it! The burger is big and comes with potato or sweet potato fries and it is enough for 2 people.  The service is great, the tables and chairs are comfortable and clean. The only thing that I'd like to see is a healthier style menu and chairs that recline.

Bought on a Groupon for my husband without checking ratings first. It has only partially working after 4 visit, to rid the hair. They begin the treatment on a lower level and then work their way up. They don't use any gel (Cheap) and it hurts like hell and do not provide any cream afterwards. And there are spotty hair patches that look like corn rows! When we confronted the black haired woman, who likes to listen to country music, she got all defensive. Face it chica, you did a craaapppy aaaasss job!   Better off with another place, check AZ spa Girls for reviews and deals, Spa 810 rocks!  Case in Point: Groupon has hit all time lows, Living Social is junk too.

The decor is shall I say overdone "eclectic antique," but quaint." Music was too upbeat for breakfast, but then changed to a nicer soft jazz.. The ladies bathroom didn't have the toilet seat covers replenished.  The place must be esthetically romantic, but a fire hazard with all of the candles at night, but I wont bother to find out and this is why: A big dining out day and they failed for brunch. Vday brunch=meh. From overpriced Evian at 7 a bottle to a 12 sangria; reasonable prices for repeated visits would be 5 and 9 respectively. We shared the scrambled eggs which were delicious, but they failed to give us the two small accompanying toasts, and a bit of a simple carb was needed. Same with the salad; no toast or biscuit served and every dish that pased me had one or two. The smattering of pruciouto was expected....eating in Spain definately spoiled us. We also shared the crab loie salad and it had a sprinkling of crab, at 20, this was pretty sad. If they want to emulate Barcelona, (and prices in Barcelona are less, at least were just a few mos ago)  or anywhere in Spain, start with some olives and breadsticks, gratis and add a croquet or 2 with a carb free dish--meal idea 101. And no butter or olive oil needed guys, save your money if you need it more than your reputation. And instead of investing in another restaurant, how about a small olive grove, they grow like weeds out here and you could serve them on the side! I understand that rent and chef wages are high, but restaurants are a competitve market, and the ingredients were not organic --which makes me wish that I could open my own because I could have created all of this in my own kitchen and better, but it's my day off. The water men were very nice, as was our waiter, but no biscuits on menu. I feel bad for those who drank bottomless mimosas with no crackers or breadsticks to soak up the alcohol. I didnt even want to stay for a coffee. We left hungry and had a croissant and espresso at Starbucks afterwards. The saving grace was my handsome, generous and loving husband, who would have taken me anywhere upon my request.

I was looking for an Aveda salon that wasn't too far from my home and work and Nu Image is the place. The décor is modern and hip. I appreciate that they offer some snack type nibbles, since a hair color appointment can take a while. Bobby did a wonderful job with consultation, color and cut and exceeded my expectations. The clothing boutique is also nice, I picked up a pretty grape colored blouse. I think that the hair station area needs a little something, accent artwork or color design in the wall or cabinet décor to really make the place visually pop.  I plan on checking out the pedi services too, since the layout of the salon is interesting and has a nice 2nd story window view!

Returned to see Bobby again and he was successful and brought down my extreme blond a few notches, closer to my natural dark blonde. At first the lowlights didn't show over the dark rinse, but after 2 weeks, it has come to achieve a beautiful blend of natural low and highlights that I desired. For a young guy, he did a great job. Bobby likes to talk a lot, I enjoy relaxing and listening to his life experiences. The owner spent time talking with me and offered me water, tea and snacks is also very kind.

Easy phone order and pick up of shrimp fried rice. This second order tasted better than my first Sunday evening order. Generous portions and fresh! A tad of soy sauce and I was happy. The spring rolls were very good too. Come on you cheapo FH peeps,  support your local restaurants!

Excellent variety of toppings for you pizza and a deal it is! I can easily share a pizza with my coworkers and get a salad for lunch to tie me over until a late dinner. The flavored tea beverages are not the norm and excellent.

I went to my appointment today and already can see results, well worth the drive. My GPS took me a bit off track and I jumped off the crazy expressway, missed the 60 and took the surface road on McClintock. I clld to say that I was running late and luckily I was able to still get in. All of the staff that I encountered, from checkin to the Practice Manager, Michella, were extremely nice, patient and helpful.    Since I have had my veins done in the past, it has been a few years and needed touch up to my "bad leg." I have quite a few scar revisions from an old mva and was worried that I'd be in a lot of pain, not so. It does hurt a bit but for a 10 or 15 minute treatment, you bite the bullet and it's over.  I received gentle care. Jillian is not only educated, she is a competent professional and an excellent vein eraser! I can't wait to go back and have more done, if needed.
