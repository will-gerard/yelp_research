This is the most legit New Mexican food place I've found in the Valley. Los Dos Molinos is more popular, but Si Señor's dishes are more traditional New Mex style. Their chile is great. If it doesn't make your face sweat, your nose run, and your eyes water, it's not good chile. I never leave this place disappointed with the heat and flavor of the green and red chile they use. Service is always pretty bad and slow, but it's worth it.

Pretty good pizza, though there dough could use a little work. I got the Funghi pizza while my wife got the Corn pizza, which had a surprising kick of slickness. Only paying $20 for two 8-inch pizzas felt like a steal so we'll definitely be back to try some of the others.

Get the Sheridan sandwich. It's bomb. Draft beer taps are limited to 8 with a decent rotation.

I come here way too often, but the enchiladas are so good. You can get up to three and try up to five different fillings. It's got a chipotle style of ordering only you don't have to worried about them busting your burrito and it's more delicious.   Both their red and green sauces are good but I prefer the red cause it's spicier and has a bit more flavor. Their jalapeño ranch dressing makes a pretty great topping for both salads an enchiladas, and they stock a decent variety of beers.   The only problem: they don't have enough locations.

Duck and lamb tacos? Are you freaking kidding me?! If you're branching out into unconventional stuff but can't make a decent carnitas or carne asada taco, you should rethink your restaurant. Taco Guild is all flash, no substance. It's biggest saving grace is it does have decent local beers on draft and some nice cocktails. Come for the ambiance and drinks, not the food.

Really chill local brewery that actually feels local. Seating is limited so get here early on a weekend if you want a stool. No patio yet, but they told me it'll be ready around September.   They had four beers on tap opening weekend (Porter, IPA, Ginger Pale Ale, and Coffee Oatmeal Stout). Everything they make is great and they got an Imperial Porter, Vienna Lager, and Honey Wheat Beer in the works so you'll find something to please pretty much all of your friends. They're even experimenting with growing their own hops because they're just so hardcore local.   No food. There's tons of tasty taquerias around the neighborhood though, making it a great place to meet up for a few brews before heading for food.
