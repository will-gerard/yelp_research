Arrowhead Lexus by far is the worst Lexus dealer in the state of Arizona. My first experience with Arrowhead Lexus should of been my last by I decided to give them a second chance.   The first issue was when I purchased my new 2014 Lexus IS350. Their sales department as well as their sales manager at the time flat out lied to me. They informed me that the vehicle that I ended up purchasing at Lexus of Chandler was nonexistent in the entire state of Arizona. They also told me that Lexus motor financial does not look at the three credit scores from experian, transunion, and equifax to decide the tier you qualify for with their special lease programs. Their sales manager just told me experian. Little did he know I myself am in the car business and have been for over a decade. Lexus as well as Toyota look at all three and pick the highest to determine your lease money factor and tier. That was my first experience knowing that I was being lied to I went to Lexus of Chandler and purchased my is350 from them in exact color combination that they said was impossible to get.   Being a person that believes in second chances I decided to give their service department a chance. As I know being in the business the sales department can be different from the service department. Service might be better I thought? Well I thought wrong. I have roughly 6,000 miles on my IS now and visited their department three times. All for warranty issues. I have had a weird clicking noise from the rear suspension that has not gone away. I brought it in when I first heard it and they told me it was fixed. A week later it was back. I then set up another appointment to get it looked at at they informed me that they could not duplicate the click. So they could not fix it. My speaker as well ended up being blown on my vehicle as well. I video taped the cracking of my speaker showing it was blown and I got a excuse that it was poor music quality from my MP3 that I downloaded from the iTunes stores. Two issues that were never resolved. As said being a person of giving people extra chances I continued to do business with them in service. I chalked up the two issues as manufacture issues and have told myself there is nothing I could do about the two issues.   My third and final straw came today as I brought my vehicle in for my first tire rotation. I informed my advisor that the sunroof roofing I guess you could call it had a strange bend in it. Which is a manufacture flaw. Upon pick up of my vehicle my advisor said that the department manager has came to the conclusion that it was a customer damage issue and I damaged it. Which is a lie. I never damaged it as it would be near impossible for myself to do it. He showed me with the sunroof open the liner fell of track and caused it the roofing to get deformed. Key phrase "sunroof open" we live in Arizona and I have had this vehicle for four months. It is hotter then blue blazes in Arizona and I have only had my roof open four maybe five times each time I recall and non of those times was I driving or putting by hands anywhere near the outside of my sunroof.   After speaking was my advisor as well as the service department manager I asked them to go out to my car and I could show them it was impossible for me to do such a thing. Long story short after explaining it to him again he "the department manager" said it was not like this when I bought the car I said are you sure about that? You saw this car when I first bought it? He said yes I inspect everyone. I said strange so you saw it when it first came off the truck? I made him repeat his answer twice. Then I said we're through here you just lied to me I purchased this vehicle at Lexus of chandler. Him being the department manager is a lack of leadership and ethics. I no longer will be taking my vehicle to Lexus of arrowhead for service. I will gladly drive the extra 15 miles to Lexus of Scottsdale. Hopefully my experience there will be different.

This store is always too busy. Be sure to bring your favorite pillow because it will be a  hour before someone can help you.

Best tattoo shop in town hands down. This studio has the best artists in the state. The shop has a awesome vibe in it from the moment you set foot in the shop. If your thinking of getting a tattoo, finishing a tattoo, or getting a coverup this is your shop look no further.
