This is where it's at! If you are looking for really good, cheap and somewhat late night (I think they are open till 11pm) mexican food, you've got to try Rosita's. I absolutely loooove their mole sauce-- best in the Valley. Try the beans and rice burro, enchilada style with mole.  Pair it with a nice cold Pacifico-- Sunday afternoon Heaven! Their salsas are to die for, and both the red and green pack some serious punch!  You've got to pay a dollar for chips, but it's so worth it. The tamales are also muy delisioso!  The little old ladies who work here are absolutely adorable in their little matching dresses. They are no nonsense, too. There's a sign posted that says "Please control your children!" I love it. Plus, they have a kick-ass temporary tattoo machine at the front where you can buy "Dogz" tattoos, with realistic looking dogs in gangsta settings. Classic.

This is my dad's wife's favorite restaurant. She thinks cilantro is exotic and Caesar salads are too spicy.  Applebee's isn't terrible. The food is.. edible? It is definitely over processed and bland, but there is at least a good variety of (tasteless) meals, and a few somewhat healthy choices. And they are open late. I wouldn't choose to go there, but if you gotta do a chain or entertain easily frightened Midwesterners it is OK.   This location tends to have horrendous service. One time we had to wait at least 30 minutes with empty dishes and cups and no check. We almost just left!

My boyfriend loves this place! They have about the nicest staff you could ask for. There's no stereotypical haughty, know-it-all, jerkhole comic book clerk (think the Simpson's comic book guy) at Samurai. They know their product and enjoy discussing comics, toys and anime with anyone and everyone. Their selection of current comics is unbeatable, although they really could use more back issues. When the death of Captain America issue came out, they sold out pretty much immediately. Because the owner knew my boyfriend was a fan and a regular, he saved an issue just for him. Ya can't ask better service than that!

Good ambiance, great service, comfortable enough, and the prickly pear margarita was delicious! So what gives with the two stars?  The food was abysmal! I've never had worse mole sauce. I wouldn't even call it mole sauce. It was more like "black bean paste." Another member of my party had the same dish as I, and we both only ate about half and turned down the offer of the box. And I love almost everything! It was just bland, which is really bad in my book. A person orders mole because they like flavor! No one else in my party complained aloud about their food (but neither did I since I was eating for free), but I heard few compliments about anything except the wonderful margaritas. Stick with happy hour at this joint.

Cypress Pita Grill is great little restaurant to grab a quick snack, an afternoon beer, or a light dinner. The restaurant is located in the Town & Country plaza, next to Trader Joe's. It's a pleasant enough atmosphere, with a small dining room and plenty of outdoor seating. The waitstaff can be hit and miss, but I've never had anything less than acceptable service.   You have to try the greek fries!!! They are amazing-- with this zesty lemon sauce and feta cheese. Pure heaven! I can dream of nothing else now. The rest of the food is always good. I wouldn't say "amazing," but definately healthy, light and filling. The veggies in the greek salad are always fresh, and the meat tastes slow grilled-- nice and tender. This is a great place to go when you are looking for a laid back meal any time of the day.  UPDATE: I've upped to to 5 stars. Today I tried their white peach sangria. Yes, folks-- they have sangria. Two kinds, I might add. It's heavenly. Go there! Now! Get some for yourself!!!

Alright so I'm not a huge fan of Arby's. I mean, I'll eat it if it's put in front of me, but generally I find everything to be a little gooey. Weird.   BUT, I gave this particular Arby's four stars for the radicalist (as in the most radical, not like a radicalist who overthrows governments and stuff) sign ever to grace the Arcadia hood. It's right up there with the great Courtesy Chevrolet sign on Camelback.  Also: they have a bell you can ring for good service! I think every Arby's has it, but I love it because people will only ring it literally AS they are running out the door.

I've read a lot of reviews about the decor not being much to look at. I found the restaurant comfortable. If they just dimmed the lights a little it might be downright cute. Jake: Much to my disappointment, I saw no magic eyes. But the mural was hilarious!  The service was excellent when we went! We had a party of 6, with diverse tastes. The waiter sized up each person and knew just how to make suggestions and offer helpful advise on menu selections. He was quick with a refill, but not obnoxiously so. He definitely got this place the four stars!  The food was pretty good. I wasn't expecting much when I saw Chimichangas on the menu, but the green corn tamales were to die for. I also had an enchilada, but I would probably stick with the tamales when I go back, which should be soon!

This is a great little lunch spot. Neatly tucked away among galleries and shops in Old Town Scottsdale, this gem was bustling at lunch time today when I went. Despite the crowd, I ordered and received my lunch promptly, and didn't even have to struggle to find a table. They even had large round tables for groups. When I walked in from the outdoors, it felt a bit hot inside, but after sitting and consuming lunch, the temperature was just right--not totally freezing like most air conditioned restaurants this time of year. The food was good-- I had a half sandwich and a side of fruit salad. Each sandwich comes standard with "the works"-- which is lettuce, tomato, cucumber, red onion, mayo, mustard and even, get this, alfalfa sprouts! My half sandwich was only $3.45 and the fruit salad was $2.00, well worth it given the generous portion and delectable fruit. They even had mangoes in there! Not your typical pineapple and strawberry mush. The other sides looked great, too, like parmesan pasta salad and the like. They have hot sandwiches, too, if that's to your liking. Nice simple little place with plenty of afternoon attractions in the area.

Oh Orange Table, what can I say about you? I am, to say the least, a regular here. Completely by default, of course, given that I work directly over this great little coffee shop.   The food here: amazing. The coffee: the best. The atmosphere: perfect. So why only four stars? Because the service can be absolutely abysmal at times. Given, there are a few star performers here who give it their all, bust their ass, and never forget a customer's name. And Sue, the owner, really seems to genuinely care about each and every person that walks in the door. But the service is so unwaveringly slow that I am often prevented from eating here due to time constraints. Example: I once ordered a cup of soup to go-- soup, mind you, that is completely ready and cooked, just sitting in a big tureen in the back-- and it took 35 minutes.   So, yes, the food is amazingly fresh, inventive, delectable. The prosciutto is shipped in from Italy. The bread is natural and baked locally. The chef's in the kitchen are mad geniuses, whipping up sandwiches, salads, appetizers, all completely fresh and filling. But you absolutely must have the time to wait for it. I've never had anything I didn't like!

This place has great pizza! The atmosphere is nice, with a long bar and an open kitchen so you can watch them put the pizza's in the large brick oven. Try your pizza with sun dried tomatoes, meatballs and risotto-- so good on that delicious crust. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because I find it so damn irritating that they have the menu on the place mats, but when you sit down there is always a plate over it that you have to move to read the menu! It gets really awkward with a large group and everyone having to hold their plate while reading. Sounds picky, I know, but it's irritating.

Delivery time was amazingly quick. Pizza was good, and hot. Drunk food never tasted soooo good! Delivery guy was actually quite nice, and normal looking. I had to speak to the manager because 1-800 dominos couldn't figure out where i lived. He was very nice, and sounded sexy! I kinda wished he'd delivered my pizza....  Trust me. You don't want to miss the Philly Cheese Steak pizza. It's delicious!

Oh man. I feel kinda bad giving this place two stars with all the glowing reviews below me. But come on! The place is soooo shady. They charged my boyfriend $3 for a glass of coke poured from a can-- and not even the whole can! And in the same night, I got charged $4, $5 and $6 the same drink from different bartenders. Any of those prices are a lot of money for a gin and tonic, with well gin! After paying cover, you end up pretty much broke at the end of the night.  On top of the money situation, this place just screams pretension! They don't have any theme-- they are just trying way too hard to be cool. I mean, there is actually a crooked painting on the wall. A crooked BAD painting on the wall.   I would have given only one star, but the martinis are pretty damn good. Plus, the music is always fun. But, still, I won't be going back anytime soon.

I heart Shady's!! You are always sure to meet someone interesting here. And not in a one-night-stand kinda way. In a "Let's have an interesting conversation" kinda way. Plus, the bartenders are always a lot of fun. By your fifth visit, they'll know your name, I promise. They show great movies all the time, always on mute so as not to interfere with conversations, and have the best jukebox in town! The infamous photographer Aaron Abbott frequents this little gem. Give it a visit, you'll be hooked.  Oh, and for you smokers, they have a nice little tiny patio.

I heart Rumbi!!!! Every single thing I've eaten here was good. I highly recommend the Aloha Mango Salad (hold the onions, though, they taste kinda weird in it), or the Bali Island Rice Bowl with Pulled Pork. Anything you get is bound to be over the top delicious though. The mango iced tea is really good, too. Their food is absolutely addictive!

This place has been pretty well reviewed already, so I'll just had one note: you have only 6 days left to stop in and enjoy some of the best margaritas $5 can buy.   I went here about a week ago with a large group, and apparently during the month of May, each drink on their entire margarita menu is only $5. The list is quite extensive, I recommend the Prickly Pear of the few that I tried (OK, maybe more than a few. What? I had to take one for the Yelp team, and find out which was the best!). They have some great appetizers, too-- like the brie and mango quesadilla. Get in there now for some cheap drinks!

So this place opened only about a month ago, and I don't even think I can count the number of times I've been here already on both hands. I really like Pita Jungle-- laid back atmosphere, beautiful interior, delicious food! Yes, the waitstaff can be slow at times, but they are young kids, and I feel they generally fit more in the "atmosphere" category than "staff," meaning they are all young and cool and hip, and thus contribute to the whole vibe of the place.   I could make a thousand recommendations, but I won't. Just read over the huge menu and try something you never would have thought of. I promise you, it will be good. I will tell you this, though: this location is still waiting on their liquor license as of my last visit. Have the iced tea, it's yummy! Also, this branch is planning to have delivery service soon. I may never leave my house again!

Yucca Tap Room! I love this place! I went on a Saturday night with an itch for shuffle board. When we walked in, I thought there was no way we'd get on the table with how crowded it was, but boy did we. We monopolized that table for what seemed like hours, playing with and against complete strangers and having a blast. A band was playing, which made for a great atmosphere but was not at all too loud for conversation-- a definite plus. I'll be going back very soon now that I've read about the live band karaoke!!

Ugh. I despise Kinko's. I despise everything about Kinko's. I don't even know where to begin. Buckle in, this is bound to be long winded.  Once upon a time, I thought Kinko's was this magical place full of neat machines and free paperclips that was constantly full of cool projects and was hopping twenty four hours a day. Then I began to need to use them for my job, and that's just when all the trouble began. First of all, very few Kinko's, if any, are even open twenty four hours a day anymore! But that was just the initial crack in their facade for me. See, I used to be able to just email them a document as an attachment, and put instructions in the body of the email. Then I would follow up with a call to make sure they got the file, which they always did. They would tell me over the phone when I could pick it up, and the orders were always on time.   THEN everything changed. They no longer accept email orders. They have created the most complicated and horribly bass-ackwards program on their website to upload documents. I understand why they did it, and I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm just saying the program needs some major overhauling because it never ever ever EVER works right. Either I can't explain what I need to them through their structured questions, or it won't upload right, or the submit button doesn't work. Then, once I finally get it to work, I have to call them 20-30 minutes later. Generally, they still haven't received my file by my first call. So I call back. I'm left on hold forever, and when they return, they still have to ask a billion questions about my order because their system doesn't tell them what they need to know. It takes virtually forever.  I really feel for the employees at Kinko's. I once worked for a copy shop, and I know how hectic things can get. That being said, I have never witnessed more incompetent help in my life. I don't blame any of the individuals that work there, Kinko's probably just has provided very little useful training for them. But still, I dread going in there. Even to simply pick up a completed order, it will take no less than 30 minutes.  On top all of that, Kinko's is expensive. Needlessly so. Simply because they have a stranglehold over the copying business gives them no right to charge those ridiculous rates for various services. Blow it out your a$$, Kinko's!
