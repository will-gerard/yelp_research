These guys are crooks. Shop manager there said I needed a new tire and that another guy was going to come in an tell me about options available. Guy B comes in and says oh you need 2 tires so let's get some prices. I said your shop manager just said I needed one. "Well I recommend 2." I'll do with 1 thank you. Guy B says oh you're just in luck I have XYZ Brand tire for $108 per tire... I drive a PT CRUISER! I could get all 4 tires BRAND NEW up the street at they're competitors shop without hassle for $75 more. Why the hell would i pay that for 1?! This place is a joke.

Ever hear your mom tell you not to judge a book by its cover? Man I'm glad I took that advice! This place looks divey on the outside, almost to the point of being a turn off. But I went anyway, and found that it is the epitome of a diamond in the rough. The best gyro I've had in years! Tender, flavorful meat STUFFED in a pita with fresh veggies. The kicker however was their loaded cheese fries with cheddar and feta. I made my wife a believer in feta by giving her a bite of these fries. They are the real deal! Do not let the exterior fool you! The best in greek fast food IN THE VALLEY!

My wife and I went there last night for a visit and damn it was worth it! We sat at the bar (tended by one of the best bartenders in the valley) and looked through the menu. He came and chatted with us and dropped a bomb on me. "we're running a special burger tonight, wild boar, bacon, arugula, and brandy aioli." You had me at wild boar my friend! I ordered it with Camembert cheese, medium. My first bite of that burger not only confirmed, but cemented what I already knew: this is the best burger joint in town! Beautifully charred boar was juicy and flavorful, accented with the smokey bacon, peppery arugula, slightly sweet yet balanced brandied aioli, finished with a mellow creaminess of the Camembert. Best burger I have ever, ever, EVER had! Bravo to the chef!
