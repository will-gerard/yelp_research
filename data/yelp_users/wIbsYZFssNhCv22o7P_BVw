I absolutely love this place. I have been twice and Katie (bar manager) has been my server both times...she is great! She recommended the bacon/Squash flatbread and it was outstanding! The wine was great, and even greater on HH (which, btw their HH is from open to 6pm M-S. They are not open before 3pm though, so don't try going here for lunch...it's a chill, nighttime place to bring dates or close friends/family members.  On weekends, there is always an acoustic musician playing. I have experienced Blaine Long and Notes from Neptune. Both phenomenal.   Long story short...if you read my reviews you know I like chill spots with great lighting and patios. This is another one of those....I will be back for a 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc time.  :)

My son goes to Karate right next door. It has been convenient stopping off at this pack and ship place to send things off....unitl last month when I had a prepaid Century Link box ready to be shipped. All I needed was a piece of tape. I didn't see any there for it's customers like FedEx and UPS has. So I set it down on the counter and asked her for a small piece of packing tape (literally 2x"2"). She said "Yes, for 25 cents." Okay, this might sound snobby, but I truly thought she was joking. I said " Really?" and I smiled. She said "Yes, 25 cents." I replied "Oh wow, you are serious. 25 cents?" She said "You have to pay for something. So you can pay for the tape."   I gave her the quarter, but she lost my business. I litereally drive an extra 3 miles to ship my things now. I want to help this business out, but I don't want to be forced to pay for tape just because the shipment was prepaid. That was not cool.

This is actually called NAILS 'U' LUV. The WORST nail place EVER. DOES NOT EARN EVEN ONE STAR. completely rude to me, my mom, and my son. Would not let my son use the customer bathroom. Glared at my mom for not putting her feet in the water when told to do so. Demanded my mom hand her the polish. Nails and dirt throughout the floor! Disgusting. Oh ya, and gave me a design on my nail that I did not ask for. DO NOT GO HERE! Oh, and they do not sterilize. Seriously. I REPEAT: do not ever ever ever go here. !!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no!!!!!!!!!!

My new favorite clothing shop. This place has my style clothes for work and personal life. Kristin is the most amazing sales person I've ever had, making sure I reap every single benefit while there. I come home with a huge bag of clothing and accessories every time and it does little to my pocket book. ****ask for Kristin!

I've been to four mountainside fitness locations and this one is my favorite. They may not have the brand new fancy machines, but they have the best staff, the best steam room, the best kid play place, and the best feel.   Basically what I'm saying is the people who come here are real and not trying to compete in a fashion show. And basically what I'm saying is that this place is better than fancy machines.   I'm actually typing this on my phone in the tanning bed because I like the vitamin D and because what else am I going to do besides write a nice review?

I love how my son actually enjoys shopping with me, but ONLY when I take him to Trader Joes because they have shopping carts for kdis. It's a great way to get my 5yr old involved while taking care of important groceries. He gets to push his cart and pick some of his food (which is great fo when he has his "picky" moments).   Everyone is super nice and their frozen foods are delicious. I wish they had more vegetable choices available. That's my only qualm. I just like to juice my veggies sometimes and they don't always have what I am looking for.

I might as well just slap myself silly for not rating this place sooner. This bookstore is the sheeeeee!!!!! Most of you realize this places is the bomb-diggity! My iPad doesn't understand these terms because it keeps autocorrections me. As I was saying, I love this bookstore. I once found a children's book for $1 with the author's autograph. I once found bandages with pictures of bacon here. I once bought a switchblade comb for my son. I once bought cliff notes for Shakespeare plays. I once bought a sticker that said "cleverly disguised as a responsible adult" and gave it to a fellow teacher friend who has absolutely earned that title. Lol!  Pint is this place is cool. It has fun random amazing things that you won't find elsewhere. Also trader joes is right next store. :))

I have to give this place 5 stars. I was expecting bad service and bad water (according to one yelp review).   However, I'm drinking water as we speak (and it's just fine) along with a fantastic mimosa (which may be why the water tastes fine). Mimosa is $5 and it's large and in charge, unlike zipps up the road, for example. I can't stand mimosas in tiny flutes.   Garlic wings were badass.   Servers (two) are outstanding and very mindful of making sure we are taken care of. She even asked for permission to serve my son another sprite. I thought that was very polite.   5 stars and nothing less.  Btw if u order a burger u get your first beer draft for under $2. Just sayin.

When fiance and i walked in...we looked at each other in shock at how tiny this place was. "No big," i said.... "this could be one of those amazing spots...i mean people look like they are enjoying their meals." i was way off. Very disappointing. Table was dirty. Server let us sit for almost 10 minutes before giving us a menu. Then took my order and walked away without my fiance's order. Weird. I ordered soup and it wasn't good. It was bad. Lunch meals were decent. Bathroom is gross which indicates to me their kitchen may not be any different. I wish I had visited the bathroom BEFORE I ordered (while waiting for FOREVER) because after seeing the water beetle and who-knows-what-insect in the god-forsaken disgusting hole-of-a-bathroom...I would have left FAST. IM SERIOUS!! Look at my other reviews of other restaurants...you will see that I am always honest.

If I eat food from different cultures, I always prefer that the ones preparing my food, serving me food, and patron eating the food are all from that culture. It tells me, "THIS PLACE IS AUTHENTIC." And that is what Korean BBQ is. The servers barely know English and I LOOOOVE that. The patrons near me....same thing! There are karoake rooms, etc. This place is awesome. I have yet to find any other korean bbq place that lets you cook your OWN meal on your OWN table on your OWN, just like Los Angeles.   I take dates and family here all the time!!

I love this theater. I take my 5yr old here once every couple of months and have no complaints! I mean, the pretzel's could be better, but this is no Wetzel's Pretzels now is it? Come to think of it, I should Yelp them, huh?  Anyway, this is a great place, very kid friendly. Only bring cash but, if you forget, they have an ATM. Good prices, of course! I usually go to Changing Hands Bookstore across the street after if there is enough time in the day (another one to Yelp).  Long story short....GO to Pollack Tempe Cinemas....unless you want a brand new movie and a brand new theater and sky-high prices. I do both :)

Best service by EVERYONE (hostesses, bartender, and server)! This is refreshing. The people eating here are even awesome! Best energy and vibe I have had in a long time. Gloria is an amazing server! Lover her! Food a little dry but honestly don't care - that's how welcoming and great these people are....I can deal with a Lil dryness in the food....just not In The people :)  Will be back.

"ICKY- Ban" is a better name for this place.  I feel bad saying this because server was nice, but this is THE WORST SUSHI PLACE I HAVE EVER EVER EVER been to. This will be closed down in no time. Mark my words.   Let me break it down:  1. Broken AC in late July (so why aren't they having someone fix it????) Who wants to eat warm sushi and drink warm kirin? Nobody! Disgusting.   2. Place smells like oil. NO, really...like the air is oily!!!  3. Dark. Lights are off. Even the tepanyaki chef is cooking in the dark.   4. Dirty table. Never toweled it down. Seriously. Dirty. Gross. Menus had food on them including the paper sushi checklist.   5. Sushi - no joke - took about 40 minutes to come out. Waaaaaaaaayyy too long and this place had barely anyone in it.   6. 2 sushi plates made incorrectly. Server messed one up and apologized for it and took it off the bill - he was nice and it was an  honest mistake and he was accountable (this is how I justify even one star).  7. There is more...trust me. Just don't go.   Why did we stay and why did we even go to begin with, u may ask? There aren't many options out here and, well, we are idiots and my uncle didn't listen to me when I read him the other yelp reviews! He has now promised to listen to me next time and to use yelp!  Now if I can just get this stink off me. Ugh.

I loooooove this place! The owner shook my hand (Edgar) and made me a custom meal. I love that it's family owned! I faxed something next door, came here to eat an amazing salad, and I'll be shopping for groceries ten steps away! Perfect! More than anything, I love how I was treated today and I LOVE that the food is AUTHENTIC! I'll be loyal from here on out!!! :)

This is my favorite place to take out of town guests...and dates!! I have literally brougt so MANY different people here. It's all outside, atop a lake, hidden in a little quaint neighborhood. I call Pier 54 my "Hidden Treasure." The white lights they put on aty night....awesome. The musicians they have on the weekends....phenomenal. :) LOVE! Also dogs are welcome!

No! Very unfriendly owner. Literally so uptight and doesn't smile. Wouldn't give me my birthday discount after I explained that I lost it...she refused. Rude and not customer service friendly. I'm so disappointed because I like the PLACE, but with service like this, forget it. I'm out. Ill go to Sunchain down the street.

Finally my official review and I'm going to make it short: LOVE this spot. There's nothing like it. Bartender Stephanie ... Served us tonight and she's the best...

Did I say I love it?! Did I mention that I love it so much I want to work here just so I can be here all the time?! Ya.

The staff I just encountered were two young men who clearly don't want to be there. They were efficient in swiftly taking care of me, but inefficient in smiling. The young girl before me was apologizing to them for not be sure of her order and they didn't so much as say "it's ok" or smile or anything....just blah...I think the girl felt bad because they were so dang serious and possibly intimidating, but I don't know...just a passive observation.   Just smile. It's not hard. Really.   That is all.

1. Bathroom is sparkling clean. Tells me te kitchen would be too.   2. Yes, handmade noodles...you can watch them do it all day long.  3. Stellar service both times.   4. Very VERY reasonable prices.   5. Omg best soup and wontons ever. For real. Seriously. Really really real for seriousness.   6. We are the only white people. All Asians eating here. This is key to knowing if an Asian restaurant is good.

This is the BEST place to get essential oils and tea. It's also the best place for educational events (Dr. Lodi of An Oasis of Healing, for example). The owner taught me how to help keep my breastmilk supply up, what to use to help my infant rest at night, what to give my two children to prevent illness, and which tea to choose for my overall well-being. I bought a cool, inexpensive, small woven basket too. I just love this place. I just recommended it to a friend who needs to remove a bad scent from her furniture!!!!!!!! I come here every time I'm in the area. GO!!!!

Want to start by saying this is our second time here and we are so happy to have given this place a second chance. First time was 2-3 years ago and we were not impressed. We had decided not to return. Well we are back and happy as hell we returned!!!!!  Un-freaking-real how delightful our service was. Honestly, the service we received is bar-none the BEST service we have ever received ever. EVER. Even the buser girl was outstanding, I'm not kidding....she was carrying buckets to the kitchen and happened to see I was done with my meal...she immediately set the buckets down, and walked the other direction to take my plate....And that's just one example. Both servers made sure we had drinks coming. Both servers gave us menus. Smiles whole time. Just a happy environment!!!! We like happy people and people who enjoy their jobs!! This is the place!   The food was great! Fiancé got the croissant and I got the chicken fried steak. Both were really good! The potatoes were perfect!!! The butter for my toast was whipped (thank you). Great cooks!   The bathroom was clean and cool! Hand lotion, spray, mints, etc!  As I'm typing this, the server and buser are saying "thank you! Have a great week!" To the table leaving.   Thank you for knowing how to be. Oh we are coming back that's for sure.   Again....BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. And good food and clean and awesome.

Brought my mom (who was in town), son, and boyfriend here. The food was so amazing that my mom called my dad (in California) to let him know how great it was. We all enjoy good food and LOVE breakfast, so we are SO happy to have chosen this spot. It will be our ONLY breakfast place. Yoli's never disappoints. I don't know why I ever go anywhere else.

I was looking for a reputable company to install blinds on all 17 windows in my home. I found a "deal" in a magazine and checked yelp before I called the company. Thank goodness for yelp because I discovered they had awful customer service etc etc.   That led me to yelp a different blinds company, which led me to Boyd's Blinds. Again, thank goodness for yelp!!!  Boyd himself came the next day, gave me 3 optional quotes (I wasn't sure if I wanted my master bedroom to look different and all that), gave me courtesy, gave me great customer service, and gave me peace of mind.   He emailed me to follow up and when I called him with questions on products I saw at lowes, he provided me info on that as well.   My house looks amazing. It's cooler in temperature and sexy in appearance. It's a comfortable place to be.   Boyd is AWESOME. My blinds are AWESOME. If u want the best customer service, if you want to support a small owner-operated business, and if you want to replace your messed up and outdated window shades.....well you now know who to contact: BOYD MILLER!!!!!   And if you love your experience like I did, I encourage you to add another great review for Boyd because he truly deserves it.   Thanks Boyd!!!

Megan took care of us today and as soon she left out table, my roommate and I looked at each other and said "She is so good and so nice." She was genuine and attentive. It turns out it was her first day by herself on the floor. Yes she made a couple of errors that affected our order, BUT!...she graciously handled it and the manager, Brian, made everything right. I was so concerned that Megan's mistake would be frowned upon (because we LOVED her) but Brian assured us that she was a respected employee.   Bottom line: Brian (manager) and Megan (waitress) took care of us the way all patrons should be taken care of. I want to thank them for making good decisions when approached with concerns. :) Very professional and courteous. :)

I came in with my son on Sunday and, while it wasn't lightening fast, it wasn't te slowest ever. Front desk was nice and the nurse was great! She was sooooo nice and good to my son. Then we saw the doctor who is Tom who was REALLY good with my little guy. He was funny and polite and efficient. He referred my son to a hand surgeon and have us a DVD of my sounds X-rays and the whole bit. We had a great experience and I recommend this place (my second time here by the way.)

Hmmmmm....well the people who work here are super nice but there have been some snags after we left....we received a bill that they didn't send to the insurance...not sure why but they said they accepted our insurance and didn't even charge a copay so I don't get it. Need to call in but c'mon....I have a life to run here.....no time for this, honestly.   And the second dr never called the next day like we were told (several days later) but I guess it's not that big of a deal, I don't know...just a little annoying....sigh*  Want to reiterate that we were treated well while there.  (I changed my stars. Please loon at my edited review)

I have to change my review. The manager called me to fix the insurance issue. She did this without me calling her. I can't remember but I think her name was Deborah? Either way, I will come back if ever an emergency.   I also want to thank the manager for contacting me to rectify the insurance situation. She was so nice and helpful and I have never experienced a hospital of any kind going out of their way to ensure I wasn't charged accidentally. So 5 stars!! All the way. THANK YOU!!!!!!!! Keep up the great customer service!!!

5 stars all the way. The first time I was her, the owner Jamie served us. She was so great and attentive!! I returned today with my boyfriend and met Amy, the other owner. She was fantastic! So sweet! My mimosas were perfect and the atmosphere was too. I have to say that I would have returned here sooner if not for a bad review that I read some time ago.  Amy told me about the review and how the person had a vendetta and outright lied with his post and image that he took from Google images. What a shame. Who does that? How mean and wrong!! Amy and Jamie are awesome!!! This place is great!!! I will be back! :))))

I've had no issues. Maybe they've cleaned up their act because they've seen their Yelp reviews. I feel obligated to give them 5 stars just to help them improve their reputation because I've had stellar service (and I genuinely mean stellar!) all around. I did the oil change and car wash and returned again for another wash. David made very sure I was happy with my clean car yesterday (I'm guessing he's some sort of manager or supervisor). The cashiers have all been wonderful!!
