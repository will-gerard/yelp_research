I so wanted to love this place, but I was so disappointed.  *Way too expensive! We spent less than 2 hours and we had seen it all...$19 for adult $10 for kids.  *3D movie was the best part, but it is only 15 minutes. *The Emergence Gallery was so crowded it was difficult to get up to the windows.  *The Garden is pretty and humid. The butterflies are everywhere! But for the price of one day here I can buy my family annual admission to the Botanical Gardens and see the butterflies often and learn more about them and do the annual Monarch tagging.  *The ant farm is a classroom science project...we were very disappointed in the size. *The bee colony was interesting and we did enjoy seeing the bees come and go.  *The fish are in wall tanks and seem like the ones you see everywhere. The sting rays are interesting to watch, but there is no place to wash hands after touching the rays...paper towels on the ledge only. *The only restroom is in the front lobby. You must walk through the gift shop to wash hands or bathroom the children...There is no way to avoid the gift shop to get to the restrooms...difficult with small children.   The concept of an indoor Butterfly Wonderland is great, unfortunately the reality did not seem like a Wonderland. Our family won't be back. This is not a good value for the money.

Kyle was our cleaner yesterday. He did a FANTASTIC job. Paul (the owner) came by to check in. This company was a pleasure to work with and I will definitely use them for all my carpet/tile/upholstery cleaning needs!
