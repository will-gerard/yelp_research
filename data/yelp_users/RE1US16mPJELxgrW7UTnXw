This is a review of Terminal 4. I fly Southwest, so...well you know...  Phoenix Sky Harbor is my home airport, so I fly in and out of it on a weekly basis. In comparison to all of the other airports I get to go to, Sky Harbor Terminal 4 ranks pretty high. It is "newer", especially the D Gates, compared to a lot of other airports and well maintained. Here are a few things to note:  1. They just recently switched their wifi to Boingo. They still have a complimentary option, so I guess this isn't a big deal. I just cringe whenever I see Boingo hotspots. Maybe because they stole the name of one of my favorite bands from the 80s.  2. Power outlets in the Southwest areas are not too plentiful. They have a few pedestals, some with 6 seats, others with no seats, throughout the terminal. I've always found these to be way too small (impossible for 6 people to sit at once) and awkward. They also have a number of choice comfy seats with outlets. I guess I shouldn't be complaining about free power.  3. The D gates are by far the smallest, so there is often no wait/very short wait at security. If your flight is going out the C gate, and you have some time but don't like waiting in lines, go through the D gate security checkpoint and walk over. The walk is not that long - Airports are like malls: you know you're going to be doing some walking.  4. I travel with a S'well water bottle so I always have water on the plane. Just don't forget to empty it before you go through security. There are a number of water bottle filling stations throughout the terminal. I usually use the one by the women's restroom at the D gates or the one at the beginning of the A gates.  5. All of the gates in Terminal 4 connect, but not too easily. It is a U-shape, from the A-D. The A gates and D gates do not connect. It's a pretty ice walk, though - if you have the time. And they also have a lot of moving walkways. And guys with carts.  I use an UP band, so I always appreciate the extra steps ;)  Happy Travels!!!

I get my prescriptions from this location. It's close, convenient, and they make it really easy to get automatic refills. The staff at the pharmacy are very friendly and helpful!

Conveniently located among a cluster of other midscale dining chains in Arrowhead Fountain Centre, Abuelo's offers an impressive variety of fare, but unfortunately fails to deliver in terms of flavor and quality..  I came in to preview their food, in preparation for my daughter's upcoming graduation. She wanted to find a nice place to go with her grandparents so I was sent on a recon mission.   When I first walked in, I was struck by the beautiful interior design, every detail trying to replicate the experience of being in the courtyard of an old Spanish villa. Weathered columns. Trees. An odd statue in the middle. The ceiling was painted to simulate a pale blue afternoon sky, white clouds frozen in time. I have to admit - it was rather well-executed. But it did reminded me of the malls of Las Vegas (think the Forum at Caesars or the Venetian) with their simulated marble finishes and mock skies that hope you forget just how fake everything is.  Unfortunately, this lack of authenticity carries over to the food as well.  The first thing I noticed when I sat down was the Ziosk machine on the table. What?! I thought I was at a real restaurant. If you're not familiar with Ziosk machines, they are mini-touch screen computers used for ordering food so you don't have to talk to a waiter, playing games so you don't have to talk to your family, and paying your bill. Thanks Ziosk! These machines are sometimes seen at casual dining restaurants (ex. Chilis) and airports. Actually, those are the only places I've seen them. Thankfully, as soon as I sat down a real person came to greet me.   The waiter was actually very friendly. He offered me chips with three kinds of salsa. The chips themselves were thin, unsalted corn chips that tasted like they just came out of a huge 5-gallon plastic bag - you know the ones. The salsas were... interesting:  Salsa one  - bland, red sauce. No reason to waste your time with this. Salsa two - chunkier salsa with a roasted tomato flavor, nice kick and mellow burn. Salsa three - tomatillo based salsa with a curiously sweet/tart flavor brought to you by pureed pineapple. Interesting, but not something I want on a tortilla chip.  The menu is HUGE. Very extensive. Like Cheesecake Factory extensive. For those of you who came to "America's Favorite Mexican Restaurant" but don't want to actually try Mexican food, don't worry  - they have you covered with dishes such as Hickory-smoked Ribeye, Lobster Seafood Pasta, and Prime Rib.   I went for the Monterrey Plate - a ridiculously huge platter that is probably intended for two people to share. I say that because I could only get through about half of it before I was just plain tired of eating. The Monterrey features:  Chile Relleno - nicely-charred poblano pepper, stuffed with cheese buried under a pile of salsa - Not bad. Rice - Ok.  Cheesy Mashed Potato - Ok, but probably unnecessary. Crispy Chicken Taco - The crunchy shell was a nice change of pace. It seemed like its only purpose was to provide contrasting texture against the platter of mushiness. Two Chicken Enchiladas -  Quite flavorful. Probably my favorite part of the meal. Avocado Enchilada - Sounds like a good idea. It is not. Sour Cream Spinach - more mush Yes, it is a TON of food. It looks nothing like the pictures because everything seemed to be smothered with sauce or cheese.  All in all, if you are looking for typical chain Mexican fare, then this is typical chain Mexican fare. Right along the same lines as El Torito or Macayos. Rather bland and uninspired.   Needless to say, we didn't take the grandparents here...

From the outside, Mixteca looks like just about any other fast food Mexican joint in the Valley. Located in a somewhat run-down shopping center (Kmart is the anchor store. Yes, Kmart) on the corner of Bell and 67th Ave, Mixteca is a stand-alone restaurant with a drive -through lane that wraps around much of the building.   I was getting some work done on my car this morning at the nearby Jiffy Lube, and while walking around I saw their marquee sign, saying that they opened at 6:30am. I had some time to kill, so I went in.  Once on the inside, you can see right away that Mixteca is not like just another run-of-the-mill fast food place. The decor is sort of a "Baja Beach" theme with a big thatched-roof shack in the middle. It feels just little more refined - they did a nice job with the interior and I was admittedly impressed. There is a bar (yes, a bar. with beer and television sets) in one corner and outdoor dining for when the weather cooperates.  As far as the food goes, they have all the standard offerings. It was morning, so I opted for a ham breakfast burrito. Nice chunks of ham, potato and cheese rolled in a huge flour tortilla. If I had any complaint, it would have been that the potato wedges were a bit too big. On some bites, all I tasted was potato. IMHO, the perfect potatoes for breakfast burritos are of the shredded hash brown variety. Diced potatoes are ok. (At one place in San Diego, their potatoes were french fries. No, I didn't order a California burrito. But I digress....) These chunks were too big. In their defense, I did order the burrito without eggs (who does that??) so perhaps they were just trying to make up for the lack of huevos by overstuffing it with papas. Oh well. I still ate the whole thing.   Oh, I have to mention - they have a great salsa bar with different types of salsas (and free chips!!) carrots, cucumbers, and onions. Great stuff.  All in all, I was impressed with Mixteca. I look forward to seeing what their lunch and dinner offerings are like!  Enjoy!!

Project C.U.R.E. is a wonderful organization that helps distribute medical supplies and equipment to developing countries. I had the opportunity to volunteer there on a recent Saturday and I hope to make it down again soon.  Housed in a nondescript warehouse space (donated by Microchip Technology) in a Tempe industrial park, Project C.U.R.E. sorts, cleans, repairs, and packages equipment and supplies that get shipped to clinics all over the world. They are a volunteer organization. I went as part of a high school group with my son. We were given a brief tour and then the group was given the task to sort supplies that had just been donated by a local hospital. Because I have a technical background and an affinity for tinkering, I volunteered in the biotech area, where medical equipment is tested and repaired. Working with a couple of ASU biotech engineering majors, I helped test, repair, clean and package x-ray viewing boxes. A couple of girls next to us were repairing an oxygen machine, and another group of guys were fixing an overhead crane light unit. It was really great to see how equipment that most US hospitals and clinics would typically discard could be refurbished to help people in need.  All in all, it was a tremendously rewarding experience. If you are looking for an opportunity to help a worthwhile organization, then here are a few tips:  1. Go to their website at www.projectcure.org. You can learn more about them and register as a volunteer.  2. Sign up and show up - They have volunteers come in Saturday morning from 9am-noon. There may be other times as well. Check the website.  3. Dress comfortably. The sorting room and biotech room are air-conditioned. The warehouse is not. Bring water.  TIP: It's a little tricky getting there if you use GPS. Look for building T3. You can see it from the street. It is a Microchip Technology building.

Every now and then, it's nice to cast better judgement aside and indulge in some unique, local fare. That's what I did today, and I'm glad I did - at least so far! At first glance, Chino Bandido looks like a pretty pedestrian Mexican restaurant, just another divey, strip-mall eatery among countless others spread across the Phoenix landscape. But they are decidedly unique. Instead of stuffing their burritos with carne asada or refried beans or shredded chicken, they fill their tortillas with the likes of Chinese BBQ pork, Jamaican jerk chicken and Egg Foo Yoo. What!!? All of there offerings are served either as rice bowls, quesadillas, or burritos. Turn your order into a combo and you get beans (black or refried) and rice (cooked one of 4 different ways).  I opted for the two burrito combo with jerk chicken and chinese pork. Now, I've been here before and sometimes the burritos are on the small side. Not so today. I'm not sure if it's because I ordered in the late afternoon instead of in the middle of their lunch rush, but these burritos were huge! The chinese pork was just the right combination of sweet and savory. The jerk chicken was packed with flavor and had a nice mellow burn to it. The combo was served with black beans (decent) and jerk fried rice (amazing). Oh, and instead of a fortune cookie, you get a snickerdoodle. Not my thing, but pretty delicious. All this for around $9!!  Now, here are a couple of things to note:  1. Yes, the place is pretty dumpy. It's located in a rough-looking strip mall. It was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and this definitely fell in the "Dives" category. The dining room is pretty non-descript - a bunch of plastic folding tables crammed into two rooms.   2. Surprisingly, the restrooms are really nice - clean and modern. They must've just remodeled them (at least the men's room), because it's the nicest part of the restaurant. How often can you say that?  3. Ok, so I have a degree in engineering but I feel pretty stupid every time I order here. They have these forms that you're supposed to fill out that are less than intuitive. I'm sure if I were a regular, I would get the hang of it. The good news is that they have a friendly staff eager to help.  All in all, it's a fun and unique dining experience. Oh, and they have an awesome panda statue in the dining room. Seriously, it's awesome.  I'll be back....

Great workout and fun climb to some amazing views of the Valley! This is a review of the Echo Canyon Trail, which ascends from the West side of the mountain. This trail is described as "intense and difficult," and I would have to agree - It's definitely a challenge, but the payoff is well worth it.  Getting to the Echo Canyon parking lot is pretty straight forward. Set your GPS to "Echo Canyon Park." If you set your GPS to "Camelback Mountain" you'll end up in some pretty high-priced neighborhood with no trail access and some annoyed locals.  TIPS: 1. Get there early! Parking fills up fast. Also, one nice thing about doing the Echo Canyon Trail in the morning is that you spend most of the time in the shade.  2. Bring plenty of water. I use a 100 oz. Camelbak and I LOVE it!  3. Know your limits and take your time. The trail can get pretty crowded. Don't feel like you have to rush because there are hikers behind you. Let them pass. Pace yourself and enjoy the hike. The last thing you want to do is go too fast and end up with a twisted ankle.  4. Make sure you have good footwear. You'll need to have good footing on this climb.  The hike starts with a pretty steady climb on an easy dirt pathway. Then you hit the a set of railroad ties. The ascent can be steep, but the railroad ties make it easy to manage. After the ties, there is a steeper, rocky section. Make sure you've got good footing. There is a handrail both in the center and along the east fence - Use them!   The next half mile or so is a mix of pathways and boulders. The final 4/10th of a mile or so is a pretty steady climb up large boulders. You'll be on all fours at various points - use your hands. Also, the path may not seem that well defined, but thousands of people have climbed up the mountain so if you take your time you'll be able to spot the road more traveled - typically the easiest route to the top. Either that or just follow the person in front of you and hope they know what they're doing!  The views from the top are amazing. Depending on when you go, it can get pretty windy up there, but the wind is usually a welcome respite after the climb. Take pictures!  On your way down there may be a tendency to move fast, now that gravity is working with you instead of against you. But the descent is often harder on your knees and joints and its easier to lose your balance/footing. Again, take your time and enjoy your hike!  All in all, Camelback Mountain is the gem of Phoenix hiking for a reason. It is a solid workout, presents a good challenge, is a lot of fun and rewards you with amazing views!

A great workout and fun hike, Piestewa Peak is a nice alternative and change of pace from Camelback Mountain. While they are similar in terms of distance and elevation gain, Piestewa doesn't have the sharp inclines or boulder scrambles that make the final ascent on Camelback so challenging. Having said that, it is still a lot of fun and definitely gets your heart pumping and calves burning!  TIP #1: If you are going on a weekend, get to the Phoenix Mountain Preserve early. Very early. Like Camelback, parking is limited and the area gets very crowded. I try to arrive around 5:00-5:30am to get a parking spot. The Summit parking lot (the one with all the cars in it!) is on the left side as you're working your way along Squaw Peak Drive. Watch for the sign - it's small.  TIP #2: There's an Alternate Summit trail that starts close to the lot before the Summit lot. Worth a try!  If you miss it, or if the lot is full, I like to park all the way at the end (Apache lot). If you do this, don't walk along the street to get back to the Summit lot. From the Apache lot, you can hop right into the Circumference Trail (302) that meets up with the Summit Trailhead. It's a great way to add close to another mile (roundtrip) to your hike. It's also a nice level warmup before you hit the incline of the Summit trail.  The trail itself is very well-defined and well-maintained. It's a series of jagged, rocky steps all the way up to the top, with some nice switchbacks and terrain variety to make things interesting. There are no boulder scrambles and with the exception of just a few spots, you won't need to rely on your hands to keep you on track.   Great views of the city (and Camelback!) from the top. Enjoy!  It does get very crowded, so it's important to be respectful of the other hikers.   TIP: Dogs are not allowed on the Summit Trail, but they are allowed on the less-traveled trails of PMP.   Pace yourself, bring plenty of water, take pictures at the top and enjoy the views along the way. Piestewa Peak is just another reason why Phoenix is a great city for hiking!!

Tucked in the corner of an older strip mall, across the street from ASU's West Campus, OHYA Sushi Korean Kitchen delivers solid Korean BBQ at a reasonable price. It's a nice little place for food and conversation....as long as you don't mind the abysmal service.  I've been to OYHA several times over the past year - my son likes the Korean BBQ grill - but I've never been there for sushi (Frankly, the seeing the words "Sushi" and "Korean" together in the establishment's name is sort of a turn-off) and I've never been there for karaoke (I...ah...nevermind), so this review is strictly based on my experiences with their Korean BBQ.  The atmosphere is casual and the though they've managed to cram as many tables into their space as possible, half-wall dividers do a nice job maintaining some level of privacy. The walls are adorned with wood planks that used to serve as tabletops. Their new tabletops now feature electric grills, which I guess they assume don't require smoke hoods. I've never had an issue with smoke there, so I suppose they know what they're doing.  On to the food - They have a nice selection of meats to choose from. Note: When ordering BBQ there is a two meat minimum. We usually opt for one chicken (dalk bulgogi) and one beef (bulgogi or galbi). You get a decent amount of food and between the two of us we are usually stuffed. Along with the meat, you also get steamed white rice and a rather disappointing array of side dishes. Whenever I have Korean BBQ, I always look forward to the side dishes - here, not so much. First of all, there are only six, mostly bean sprouts and kimchee. Secondly, the kimchee has never really tasted very...fresh (yes, I know it's fermented cabbage and it's supposed to have that old flavor, but it's just not what I usually expect.) Anyway, the food is pretty good (depending on how my son cooks it ;)) and we usually leave very satisfied.  The main problem is the service. The service is beyond bad. With the large number of tables they have, during the lunch rush I have only seen one waitress working at a time. One. The last two times we were there, we have seen multiple parties get seated, then walk out 20 minutes later after never getting served. This seems to be a common occurrence. Yes the service is bad. The last time we were there, we had to ask for rice and a fork multiple times before we finally got them. I don't really blame the waitress here - I blame the management for not ensuring that the shifts are adequately staffed.  Anyway, I give the food 3 stars, minus 1 for the service. Come here for the food. You'll enjoy it. Just don't come if you're in a hurry or expect even marginal service.  Enjoy!!

I think I may have just found my new oil change garage! I've had some bad experiences at other Jiffy Lubes in the past. Yes they are fast, but I've always been a little worried that the servicemen there are too concerned with rushing through the job that they may miss something.   I have been going to another service station down the street for years, but this morning they were just too busy so I decided to see if Jiffy Lube could fit me in. I pulled up and they were able to get me started right away. One mechanic took my keys, while another one escorted me to the office. I talked to the manager and got everything going. I was in for an oil change and full tune-up, which included spark plugs (16 of them!), new air filter, cabin filter, windshield wipers and fluids. I expected to wait a few hours. They were done in just a little over one hour. I couldn't believe it!  Now, was I worried that they may have gone too fast? Not at all, because the manager talked me through everything and I actually watched as FOUR of their guys worked under the hood.   The price was good, the service was fast, but what really stood out was how courteous every single employee was. When my car was done, an employee walked me out to my car, where another employee had it waiting. Good stuff.  Oh - and they have free coffee and a very clean restroom in the waiting area!

Dealing with Sanderson Lincoln over the past few years has been a pleasure. The salesman I dealt with worked very hard to find the exact car my wife was looking for with only the options she wanted, all at the right price. He made the buying experience the best I've ever had - no high-pressure selling or tricks. It was almost too easy. He was very upfront and accommodating.  Since then, I have had the car in for regular maintenance and service. Travis does a GREAT job. They are always on time, offer me a loaner car, and clean/wash the car when done.   If you are in the market for a Lincoln in the Phoenix area, I HIGHLY recommend them!!

So yeah, I've been a fan of Nordstrom ever since I worked at the Paseo Nuevo Santa Barbara store (#344) over 20 years ago when I was in college. (Yikes!) They are widely known and respected for quality designer merchandise, diverse selection, and unparalleled customer service. But what some people don't realize is that their cafe is pretty amazing as well! Yes - their food!  At the Scottsdale Fashion Square store, the cafe is tucked away on the third floor next to the restrooms. From the sales floor, it looks like it would be pretty small. It is only once you go inside that you realize just how spacious this place is. Ordering is done "cafeteria style," though with the exception of soups and desserts, you don't actually pick up your food at the line - you get a table number and a server brings the food to you. Ok, so it's not a fine dining experience. But that's ok, because the quality and variety of the food more than make up for it. They have a wonderful selection of sandwiches, pastas, salads, and entrees, along with an absolutely decadent array of desserts. They even serve wine if you're so inclined.   On this last visit, my son and I went because he was craving their tomato basil soup. Tomato soup. I think it's worth mentioning that we do not live close to Scottsdale. This Nordstrom location is about 25 minutes away from our house. But in his mind, no one even comes close to making a tomato soup as good as they do at the Nordstrom Cafe. The soup is silky smooth, with a nice deep tomato tartness. It is served with a toasted crostini. My son likes to dip the crostinis in the soup, so we usually order an extra side of bread.   Tip: Ask for more crostinis!! They are so good!  I went with the mushroom ravioli. Seven wonderful pockets stuffed with a chopped/pureed mushroom fill, served with a creamy mushroom/sun-dried tomato sauce and topped with parmesan and fresh basil. At first, I was worried that seven raviolis would not be enough, but after savoring the last bite I had to admit that I was stuffed and completely satisfied.  The service was prompt and attentive and the overall experience was great.  With all the great things that Nordstrom has to offer, it sorta funny that the main reason my son and I drive across town to Fashion Square...is for the food!  Try it - you won't regret it!!  Oh, and the prices were pretty reasonable - our bill was under $20.

TIP: First thing you want to do when you go to REI is buy a Co-op membership. It's only $20 for a LIFETIME membership and it gets you an annual dividend based on how much you spend during the previous year (typically around 10% back), and access to their Garage Sales.  They have a great selection of outdoor gear here. Sure, in some cases the prices may shock you, but you pay for quality and when you're out in the middle of nowhere relying on your gear to keep you warm and safe, you'll be happy that you paid a little extra for the good stuff! They do have less expensive alternatives as well.  Aside from the selection, the one thing that I really appreciate at REI, especially at this location, is their staff. I have always found them to be friendly and knowledgeable. They know the gear and they know what you'll need for your trip, because they've used the gear on all of their own trips.   I've never had a bad experience there and I look forward to more adventures!!  (Note: No, I don't work there!)

If you ever find yourself stuck at the B Concourse at McCarrens, well then...I'm sorry. Saying that the dining options there are limited is an understatement. I had a layover in Vegas on a flight from Chicago to SF and was actually excited that my flight was taking off through the B Concourse, having previously exhausted all of the choices at the C Concourse. That excitement turned to disappointment when I found that there were only really two places to eat at the B end. I opted for 360 Gourmet, a burrito place that seemed to have limitless custom options.  I was pretty hungry, so I ordered the burrito bowl with sautéed shrimp. Feeling particularly daring, I opted to "Jazz it up" Thai style, which cost more but promised carrots, jasmine rice, and peanut dressing. That should be good, right? I also ordered chips and salsa. No drink. It was close to $17.  I was impressed that the food is actually prepared fresh right there on a series of burners. I was cautiously optimistic. But when I got my food things changed. First of all, the bowl was very small. Now I recognize that as a culture we tend to overindulge when in comes to cheap food by consuming oversized portions of food, but this was ridiculous, especially considering the cost. I took the bowl back to my ledge (they don't have tables or chairs) then realized that I had not yet received my chips, so I went back to the counter.  "Can I please get my chips?" The woman at the counter looked at my quizzically.  "Oh," she replied. "I didn't know you wanted chips. I didn't hear you, so I didn't charge you."  I went back to my ledge and came back with the receipt that clearly showed that she had both ordered and charged me for chips. Without saying a word, she went to the back and dumped a handful of chips in a paper bag.  Ok, now on to the shrimp bowl. It was bland and tasteless. But wait, what about the peanut sauce? And the carrots? I looked the bowl over closely and went back to the counter.  "Is this Thai style?" I asked.  "Yes."  "Where's the peanut sauce? And the carrots?"  "It's in there." Well she could've told me that she also threw in some lobster because there was as much lobster in my bowl as there was peanut sauce. So either she lied, she didn't know any better, or their food is so bad that the sauce is entirely unrecognizable.  Either way, I couldn't finish the bowl, despite its small size. It just wasn't worth eating.  This review may seem a bit on the harsh side, but seriously - if you find yourself at the B gates, then walk over to the C gates. The food options aren't great but they are miles ahead of this slop they try to pass of at 360 Gourmet. If you don't have time then go to the Einsteins across the way and buy a prepackaged chicken wrap. You'll be happy you did...  Needless to say, I will not be back. I'm half guessing that this place will be out of business within the year anyway.

I've been a 24 Fitness member for about 7 years and have had the opportunity to visit a number of their clubs throughout the country. Unfortunately, my home club in Phoenix is not the best.   Don't get me wrong, it's relatively well-maintained (despite being in a run-down strip mall) and they always seem to keep things clean and in operation. They have a nice mix of free weights, machines, and cardio equipment. I tend to go in the evenings and there is never a wait for equipment. The locker room is ok, though I rarely shower there (would rather just go home). I've also never taken advantage of their classes.  My only real complaint is their hours. They close at 9pm on weekends. Since I travel most of the week, I typically only go there on weekends and its tough when they close so early. It's pretty annoying for a place that's called 24 hour fitness. Sure a name doesn't necessarily mean much - TCBY is NOT the country's best yogurt, Best Buy doesn't always have the best deals, and 31 Flavors never has 31 flavors (they usually have more - I've counted), but I certainly don't expect a place called 24 hour fitness to close as early as they do....

I love Elevate Coffee! Easily my favorite coffee shop in the Valley, Elevate offers great drinks, friendly service, a diverse and satisfying menu all served up in a casual, homey atmosphere. Located in Norterra, right by the movie theaters, Elevate is a great place to hang out with friends before a flick, grab lunch, get some work done, of listen to live music. I've been coming to Elevate for some time time and it is my perfect destination when I need to get some work done, but want to get out of the house. (I work out of my home office.)  Free Wi-fi!!!  They have a main open room with a variety of tables, seats and sofas; a stage area tucked away to one side, and a fireplace room which is usually opened up to the main "living room." When the weather is cooperating, they also have a lot of outdoor seating.  Tip #1: They used to have signs but I haven't seen them in a while. If you are trying to work and are by yourself, be considerate and save the tables for groups. There is usually plenty of room (and plenty of outlets!!) at the community table. Make a new friend!  Tip #2: If you are there working and get a phone call, please take it outside. Don't be that guy...  They have great coffee drinks, but I usually like to try out the different teas that they have. They are amazing.  For food, where do I start??? They have some great sandwiches, but my favorite is the Raspberry Turkey Havarti Wrap. The sweetness of the raspberries blend beautifully with the turkey and the havarti smooths everything out, reminding me to Thanksgiving Day in a wrap! Served with chips or....try their blueberry slaw. It's different, but definitely worth a try!  If you're in the mood for a sweet treat, their crepes are phenomenal. I know it's relatively common (in the world of crepes, that is) but I love the Nutella with Banana Crepes. So good, but I do feel like I have to go for a jog afterwards. They have savory crepes as well, but whenever I'm in the mood for something savory, I default to the turkey wrap.  I've never been there for a concert, but they do have an pretty full event calendar with an eclectic blend of artists.  The service is top notch! Everyone is just so darn nice here!  Can you tell I like this place?  No, I do not work here...Ha!

There are a number of Starbucks locations peppered throughout Phoenix Sky Harbor. This is a review of the one at Terminal 4, C Concourse. I imagine that a lot of these comments likely apply to all of them....  Ok, this is your typical airport Starbucks location. It is conveniently located right next to the security checkpoint at Concourse C so you're able to get your drinks on right after shedding any liquids you may have tried to sneak past security. It can get pretty busy (it's a Starbucks, after all) but the staff does a nice job of getting through orders pretty quick. The only complaints I have are:  1. I've had issues using my phone app here, especially when trying to get free refills. As an airport location, they probably don't have a lot of folks taking advantage of their generous refill policy, so that may be the issue. On more than one occasion, my card has been charged full price and the staff has no way of crediting my account. Not a huge deal, but somewhat annoying.  2. Blueberry Oatmeal - They do NOT use fresh blueberries here, only dried ones. For someone who eats a lot of oatmeal and often buys extra blueberries, this is sorta a big deal.   3. They do not sell the Evolution Fresh drinks here. I LOVE the Sweet Greens, but alas - not here. They only sell the psuedo-wannbe healthy sugar bombs called Naked Juice. I assume that this is an arrangement with the airport.   Maybe I am high-maintenance, but my "go-to" Starbucks order in the morning usually consists of coffee, oatmeal, and Sweet Greens. At this location, I'm left with just the coffee....

Wow...I'm not quite sure how this place stays in business. The single star is not a reflection of the quality of the fare or the drink selection. I actually am not in a position to review the food or beer. Because I was never served. I was never even approached by a waitress. Oh, that's not entirely true. At one point in the twenty five minutes that I waited before giving up, a waitress came stumbling by carrying beers asking "Did anyone order a Bud Light? Who ordered the Bud Light?" I was half tempted to take one, knowing that the poor sap who ordered it probably left an hour earlier. Seriously, with all the places to watch games in the Valley, there is simply no reason to waste your time with this place...

Standard El Pollo Loco fare here - marinated flame-grilled chicken and all the fixins. The one thing that is notable about this particular location is the friendly service. We come here about once a month or so and the food and service is consistently above par (compared to other El Pollo Loco locations).  They are accommodating, efficient and work hard to ensure that the orders are correct. That's all management and they deserve a nod. If you're looking for a quick, delicious meal in the area, El Pollo Loco is an easy choice.

Neat place with friendly staff and great food. Had the Squash Blossom Wrap for lunch today. Fresh, flavorful vegetables in a wrap, served with jalapeño cole slaw and a cookie. A real steal at only $6! Will definitely be back.

I had the opportunity to visit Culinary Dropout at The Yard earlier this year as part of a Yelp Elite event and I have been looking forward to coming back ever since. If you've never been to The Yard, then you need to check it out. Located in Central Phoenix close to Missouri and 7th Street, The Yard offers three distinct restaurants and a common patio area - a GREAT place to hang out with friends. On this recent visit, I took a small group of customers there for lunch. While I was leaning towards Barrio Urbano (SO amazing!) one of the guys in our group had just had Mexican food so we decided on Culinary Dropout. We were glad with the choice!  We started off with a few small bites: brussels sprouts, roasted beets, and truffle cheddar potato chips. The brussels sprouts were perfect roasted with a nice char on the outside. The beets were small cubes served with light balsamic finish. They  had a deep, earthy flavor that hit the spot. The chips were also very good, crisp and salty with shaved cheese on top (can't go wrong with that!) All in all, the snacks were very good - only $3 each but a little on the small side. I'm glad we got them all as starters.  For my lunch, I went with the seared tuna salad, a large bowl of greens served up with a light ginger vinaigrette, cashews and crunchy wasabi peas, topped with petite, delicate seared ahi medallions. The smooth taste of the tuna mixed with the fresh greens and dressing (with the occasional crunch) was wonderful and I was very satisfied.  The sandwiches also looked very good. One of my customers ordered the chicken club and it looked like a monster bacon cheeseburger with a grilled chicken breast in lieu of a beef patty. Cheese was oozing down all sides and it looked amazing. I might need to try that next time!  If you are in the Central Phoenix area and are looking for a cool place to hang out and enjoy some great gastro-pub fare, then look no further than Culinary Dropout at The Yard!  Enjoy!!

One of my family's favorite go-to's for pizza, Fired Pie offers great tasting pizza with endless variety. For only $8 each, everyone gets their own pizza with unlimited toppings, so don't hold back! Get whatever you want!  They do offer a gluten-free crust (for additional cost) but their regular crust is light and comes nice and crispy out of their pizza oven. They have a variety of sauces: I stick with the traditional tomato sauce, but my wife and daughter like to mix it up with olive oil and pesto. They have a number of different cheeses, a host of veggies, and a ton of proteins, including....ANCHOVIES! Yes, now I can finally have anchovies on a pizza without my family complaining. Fired Pie, Thank you!!  They are located in a busy strip mall, close to the movie theater, so parking can be tricky. They do have a cozy dining room, but we usually get our pies to go.  Enjoy!!!

Hooray for PHX Burrito House! Yes, there are a ton of great options for Mexican food in the Valley, and if you find yourself in the Melrose area looking for some hometown Mexican fare, then PHX Burrito House is the place for you.   On my last visit I went with their carne asada burrito -  savory chunks of nicely-marinated and seasoned beef with all the fixings wrapped in warm tortilla. I also added some chips and salsa. Great flavors that hit the spot. After settling for just so-so Mexican food as of late, I was happy that I came.  Staff (owner?) was beyond friendly. Wonderful service all in all.  Easy parking, freshly-made flour tortillas and salsas and GREAT hometown service make PHX Burrito House the place for me!

Lackluster service and just-passable food makes this hotel restaurant a rather forgettable place. I went there for breakfast twice, while on a weekend "staycation" at the Clarendon Hotel, chaperoning my son during ComicCon. When my wife booked the room, it came with breakfast vouchers - vouchers that are actually only good for $12.50. Add a cup of coffee to almost anything on the breakfast menu and you're almost assuredly going to blow through the $12.50 if you include tax and tip.  Not that I'd try to dissuade you from having the coffee. It's actually really good. Probably my favorite thing there.  On my first visit, the service was absolutely abysmal. I was seated at the counter -  in full view of everyone - for over 15 minutes before the hostess (seeing that I was being ignored) took it upon herself to scribble my order onto a post it note. I ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo. I think places like Chipotle have raised our collective expectations as to how large a burrito should be, and this one came in at disappointingly "modest." It was, however, packed with chorizo. Unfortunately its flavor was masked by the copious amount of salt that they put on it. Yikes. It was served with two salsas (stick with the red one) and a small bowl of fruit. Not great, but hey - it was under the $12.50 mark.  The next day the service was a little better. I was seated promptly and my waiter took my order right away. This time I went with the sausage burrito. It was actually smaller than the first one, mainly because there was very little sausage in the burrito. Oh, and no salsa. No fruit either. I wasn't really going to make a fuss and complain about this "free breakfast."  But I'm also not planning on ever coming back.  You may have better luck with their lunch or dinner menus, but I'm not going to find out...  Happy dining!

So happy to have a local coffee shop back in the area! I was a huge fan of Next Coffee before it closed and now I have a new place to grab a cup of joe while getting some work done. Located on 59th Avenue, just across the street from the post office and Midwestern University's Glendale campus, Small Town is a cozy, modestly-sized coffee/tea/smoothie place with a handful of tables inside and a few patio tables outside. The inside is clean and basic. They serve up freshly-brewed Dazbog coffee and have the normal offering of specialty coffee drinks, along with some snacks.   Very friendly staff and cool environment for hanging out with friends or catching up on email/work.  Looking forward to my next visit!
