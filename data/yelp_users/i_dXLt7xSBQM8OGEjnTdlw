Our waiter was cool,  but the food was awful,  tasting of old,  dirty grease on a skilled cook top.  Waste of time.

Jesse and I had a lovely evening out- we had great dishes and the owner was our server as well. He belts out a lovely Italian birthday song while playing the guitar. Very nice

We went here last night before dinner to grab a snack while we waited on our reservations at a restraurant nearby. The place is charming with its 1950s traditional ice cream parlor decor all done up in pink and white. In the back room there is a half way done kid's area with a couple of old games.   Although the atmosphere is sweet on the surface and the staff was nice- the place lacks in cleanliness. The floors were dingy (they need a good strip, scrub and wax) and the restrooms were hideous and dirty! I'm with the previous reviewers in that the place needs a good cleaning.  Our group ordered a few cones and while my rasberry sherbert was good- we'll likely be going elsewhere for a sugar fix next time.

I was brought here for breakfast on several occasions and I'm happy to say that while the decor is a little grandma-y the food is good and the prices are even better. The servers are friendly and make you feel at home.  Good eats.

This place is always friendly and my big group of friends and I always have a good meal. I've yet to have a sub par experience. I love the grilled chicken breast with veggies, moist and flavorful. Desserts are always good and some come in half portions which is helpful. The outdoor area is great to sit by, especially when it's cold and the fireplace is roaring.

Several times they've run out of things like the pretzels and condiments... disappointing service and long waits even then.

Good food, nice prices and friendly people. The place is well staffed although they could do a bit of spring cleaning, my side of the booth was littered with napkins and what not. Surprisingly they have delicious roast beef sliders.

Jesse and I went there last night on whim after driving around aimlessly looking for a new place to try. It wasn't busy at 8:30pm but there were a few people at the bar and a large party enjoying themselves nearby. Our server was nice and quick when it came to serving. The menu is HUGE! I got the Mamouska and Jesse ordered the Greek Stirfry. Both were big portions and equally delicious. You can tell that there are some great people in the kitchen. The pita bread was soft and warm and overall we had a great time.

Great service- been here twice and it's been great each time. CLEAN- I love that about T&J's- no sticky tables! I get chicken with pineapple, awesome! Egg drop soup is fantastic and the sweet and sour sauce is delightful!

We came here today with our two dogs. I'm writing this as my husband tends to one of our dogs after he had a bad experience here.  This review may seem long, but I believe that if you're going to give a review, especially one that is less than stellar, then you should give a detailed explanation.  Upon first entering, the place is normal- barking dogs, a little shop and the self wash area. Alex, the front desk girl was friendly and took our dogs without incident. The dogs are all allowed to mingle unless they're aggressive or not fixed. I felt good about finding a new place and set off for the 2 hours that we were told it would take.  Unfortunately one of our dogs suffered a short seizure due to stress during his bath- something not common when he's bathed at home but not surprising given that he is a dog and that sometimes happens. I wish that we had been called and notified that he was having a seizure rather than him being left with panicked staff (the girls said that he must have gone into shock and that they were worried but that it wasn't as bad as some that they've seen). They didn't blow dry this dog because they didn't want to stress him more and offered us a towel to take so that he could be further towel dried.  Both dogs looked good, though the one who had had a seizure was clearly upset. He was bleeding profusely from his front paw, a sign of a cut too close on his nails. The other front desk girl was not concerned about it and just said that it should stop soon. I've never dealt with a bleeding nail, that's why we go to a professional, but I figured that they knew what they were saying so we paid (receptionist said she gave us a discount, that was nice, though we didn't get an original quote on the wash and brush so it's not clear if we were and for how much), left a good tip and went out to the car.   On our way out to the car blood spots were increasing as he walked so I took him back into the shop and asked if they could do something. The receptionist said sure and out came the nail tech with some Quick Stop in a container. The nail tech apologized, saying that it must've been too close to the root. This is taking place outside of the shop, in the parking lot as she tries to put the powder on my dog's paw as he winces and yelps- further stressing him while she said it wasn't bothering him, after about 5 minutes of this we feared another seizure was going to happen so my husband picked him up and placed him on the towel in the car. The receptionist said to keep him from knocking his nail so it won't bleed more and to just put flour on it if it does. We thanked the tech for her help and left. There are blood stains all over the towel and through it onto the floormat. I'm not happy. He's not happy, and his brother is stressed out because of the commotion too.  I understand that things happen, but notify the customer and give proper care to alleviate the issue. Our dog should have been taken into the store, cleaned up, and bandaged so as to keep him safe and comfortable. Customer service and compassion are not a strong suit here  We came home and luckily our neighbor saw our dog's paw and offered to help us to stop the bleeding. Both dogs are now laying on the rug, exhausted from their misadventure and the husband and I are getting ready to clean up the mess in the car. Figured I'd jot this down while it's still fresh.   I hope that this is a fluke in their business and that they service pets better normally- it's a stressful situation for both us as owners and especially for our dogs.  I hope the owner contacts us, I would appreciate a response.  ~In Response to Ruth S.  Thanks for more professional insight- I see where you're coming from, though I stand by what I wrote for my experience. I acknowledged the fact that accidents happen- especially when a dog has dark nails- but these are professionals trained to handle it. I made it pretty clear that the service was fine, I'm not satisfied with the way the situation was handled. It's not a good practice to send a dog out bleeding without treating it, you shouldn't wait for the customer to have to come back in to ask for the quickstop. I'm a little confused about the tip bit you responded to, I would never go and take a tip back- that seems strange. I tipped because I thought they did well, until I walked out and saw the pain my dog was in. One dog was fine, the other had a bad experience, I as a customer left unhappy and I believe that this review was fair. As for your review, it's a response to me, not a review on the business, perhaps it belongs in a different area.

Kara, the owner of See Spot Clean contacted me and was gracious and kind in her reply to my review. I appreciate a good owner and this gives me faith in her business. I believe that this bumps up my experience significantly and I want to share that with yelpers. I'll bring my dogs back for another go.

Always busy- so call ahead seating is a great thing to have. Crowded tables make for awkward waiting and feeling in the way when trying to get to the table, the restroom, or to leave. Good iced teas.

We've been going to Nick's for a few years now- and the pizza and wings are ALWAYS delicious! We've turned a bunch of family and friends into Nick's pizza lovers and the group is growing.   The inside of the Nick's is like a small cafe with about 6 smaller tables for people to sit and grab a bite- this isn't the place to come and hang out.   The pizza is perfect- the crust is fantastic and the sauce is just right. They use Boar's Head meats and cheeses so the quality is pretty good, way better than regular chain restaurants.   Nick and his family are very sweet and recognize us when we come in- they've always got a smile on and if they're trying something new- chances are they'll offer it to regulars to see how they like it. Ask Nick for some Parmesan knots- they're awesome.   We order pizza here at least once-twice a month and it's a go to for wings- they're big and meaty and with several different sauce options you can't go wrong.   Nick's Deli and Pizza is the real deal- you get great food from great people!   .

I had a kudzu deal for this salon where I was looking to get my long, curly hair cut. Sam (who came highly recommended for curly hair) did a wonderful job cutting off 7 inches and doing a face framing, curly lovely cut.

How sad that the reviewer below is so upset- they are very clean and sanitary- bare hands is preferable in cooking enviornments because it allows people to be more accurate and in most cases, cleaner because of the constant hand washing- they're more aware of the need to wash hands and clean up. When you wear gloves, people tend to touch everything and not change their gloves because they're un aware of the risk.  My review:  Lady Diana's Cakes is fabulous!  We ordered a smaller, two tiered cake for our wedding and Juan and Lady Diana still gave us the attention and care as if we had ordered a huge cake with all the bells and whistles.  Juan was fantastic, I sent him a few ideas of the kinds of cake that we liked and he gave great feedback and completely embraced the elegant style that we were going for. A few days before the wedding Juan called me to ask about the ribbon color and without fail he produced the perfect match, at Lady Diana's Cakes they care about every detail!  We noticed something wonderfully peculiar about the cake when Juan delivered it to the venue....it was taller than we had ordered! Lady Diana took extra time and supplies to create a cake that was especially beautiful for us, a very sweet gesture that did not go unnoticed.  The cake was delicious red velvet with amazing icing, we were going to save the top tier for our anniversary...but it we couldn't help but eat it as soon as we got home from our mini honeymoon. Needless to say we'll be ordering a new small red velvet cake for our 1st anniversary :)  If you want something beautiful and delicious from someone who geniunely cares, Lady Diana's Cakes is the place to go.

Took my mom for a pedicure present and after reading the reviews. We called ahead and were seated quickly. The water was warm and the seats are great. The polish was well done and I liked the massage. Everything was neat and tidy which is great. It was a little busy during the middle of our pedi and though we weren't rushed. One of the gentlemen was talking on his phone while doing a woman's manicure but was off after a few minutes.  The prices are good, 18 for pedi and 5 dollars for extras. We got callus remover and big toe design- very cute designs.  We will be back :)

Danielle and her team were amazing! From our first meeting, Danielle was warm and caring. We had already booked a photographer for our February wedding but we knew that something was missing---Danielle!   After meeting Danielle and going over her portfolio, it was clear that we needed to breakup with the other photographer and go with Danielle. After dealing with unclear paperwork from other vendors, Danielle's organization and clear cut details were a breath of fresh air. Danielle gives a photo release, a disc with both print and web quality versions of your pictures and hosts all of your images in an online gallery that you can share with your guests.   I found her site, and after going through hundred of beautiful photos and reading her blog, I knew that she had sharp skills and a wonderful personality. Danielle worked with us on budget and time and we couldn't have been happier, she truly connects with her clients and it's clear that Danielle deserves 5++++++ stars.   When our venue gave us a last minute switch with location of the bridal suite, Danielle took it in stride and helped me to pull things together, offering advice and professional insights on how to make things work. We were fortunate in that all of our vendors were wonderful, but Danielle THE best vendor we had the pleasure of working with. Danielle is open with communication and always available- pre and post wedding.  Our photos were absolutely stunning! We're camera shy, but Danielle and her team were wonderful at making us feel at ease and that kind of comfortable relationship is what makes her service so unique. The way our wedding was shot shows the story from beginning to end. She covered all of the details and the emotions of the day; I don't know how she caught it, but there is even a picture of my dad with a tear in his eye. While they're everywhere, capturing everything, they are not in the way, Danielle and her teams blended seamlessly into the background when they needed to and yet managed to produce gorgeous photos.  The photography aspect of a wedding is important, if you want to have the big day done right, choose Danielle. The picture turnaround was great and the quality is stellar, Danielle is extremely professional and a magnificent person to work with. We are still in touch and will be calling her again to capture our next milestones.

Our usual group of 6 went to Mabel's to take in the dark, sexy decor and we weren't disappointed. We went in at 7pm Friday night and we had the place to ourselves. We chose to sit in a big open booth where we had a full view of the lounge, there are lots of different places to sit at including sofas and chairs situated around small tables- very speakeasy like.   A couple in our group ordered the deviled eggs with caviar, and they weren't extraordinary but fairly good nonetheless.   Our server, Holly was nice and kept our glasses filled- the bartenders were friendly and quick with our friends' drinks.   The imprinted tin panels on the ceiling were gorgeous and the penny covered floor in the ladies' room was pretty snazzy. There was a party going on in the back 'secret' room so we didn't get to see it this time.   Overall, it was a fun time at Mabel's and we'll come back again a little later so that we can have the full experience when the place is full.

My husband and I go to Ocean Blue all the time since we live near to Westgate. The place is always clean and there is always a new flavor to try. The sample cups are small-like the tiny paper cups used for condiments- but they are after all, sample cups.   There's plenty of seating inside and out. I do agree though with some of the other reviewers that the staff manning the place are sometimes aloof and usually on their phones. The prices are fair and I like the place overall-we will keep visiting.

Went for a birthday party. A lingering layer of stickiness coats everything. Bar staff over serves people and when they finally hit their tipping point, kick them out, literally onto the curb behind the bar. I don't drink, so I witnessed it happen 2 times while  I was there. Restroom attendenent was pushy and crowded the already tiny restroom. The birthday girl enjoyed their drink card.

We went in on a lackluster Friday night, our server was slow and we were placed in the back corner next to a loud group of ladies despite the restaurant being empty. My water was constantly empty and the staff around was too busy talking with one another to check in on us. My husband's dish was good, a smallish bowl of meat and chili with his entree. I had the veggie plate and while the rice was great, the rest was awful, greasy and slimy. I was unhappy with the food and service, and the prices aren't great. Not coming back. A shame considering that the restaurant is in a good location and looks cool.

This is a seperate visit from the last time I reviewed. I appreciate that the owner  Paul F. takes his role seriously and contacted me to remedy our poor first experience. Paul sent us a handwritten letter, a lovely touch, accompanied by a gift card for dinner to try Caballero again and that he would be happy to personally handle our reservations. We decided to try it again, coming in without reservations to experience everything without letting anyone know that we were reviewing, to get a more accurate representation and I'm glad we did.  Ok, big points for service this time around. We came in last week about 7pm on  Saturday night, the restaurant was busy but we had space between us and the next party so it was nice and quiet.We had Luis as our server and he was prompt, helpful and funny. We sat at our table and he was there right away, ready to take our drink order. The menu looks different, some new choices since last time we came. Started with the avocado chimis, very good- I'd never had anything like that before.   I had the fish, steak and chicken pasta- interesting mix, I'm not too sure about the black beans in the dish but it was cooked well. Perhaps it would be better with one type of meat, smaller pasta and no black beans. Though way better than what I had for the first order.  My husband had the green chile and pork dish, he enjoyed it and commented that the chilis tasted better than last time. I tried his and I agreed, the pork was well seasoned and that rice is still delicious.  We had dessert this time, the 3 layer chocolate cake- so delicious! Best part of the evening. Overall it was a much better visit and I have to give a big thank you to Paul for taking the time to reach out to us and invite us back.

This restaurant looked great on the outside, once we got in however, things changed drastically for the the worse. The hostess was unfriendly, seemed annoyed that she had to get up and walk us over to our table (that was not clean, she asked us to wait while someone could come to wipe it) even though the place was practically empty.   The server was nice, she tried to perk up the place but when I asked for her recommendation between their "signature" mac and cheese and a dinner potato she hemmed and hahed because she didn't like either. That was not a good sign. When our food came out it was disgusting. My husband order the brisket- you could tell it had been boiled (what a waste of meat) and was completely fatty, the potato was hard and the chili was absolutely canned.   My pulled pork was soaked in water, so much so that the BBQ sauce wouldn't stay on. Disgusting mac and cheese went to top it off- bland and slimy. I was absolutely dissatisfied and especially considering the higher prices it was awful. Never coming back.

The outlet closed just before Christmas. I work in the same building complex and was here 4-6 times a month.The ladies were fabulous, Nikki, Mary Ellen and the whole gang were so helpful. I'm sad that the building was sold. I have hundreds of items from Freddi's and loved each.

The restaurant has a really cool vibe. Definitely country.  There is a cool giant wagon wheel hanging above the dining room. I had the chicken pot pie, amazing crust and delicious filling. Jesse had the beer can chicken,  super moist and came with 2 sides.  The tequila beans were beyond anything I've ever tasted. Fast and friendly,  our server was great. Restrooms were impeccable and have cool metal work. They have a nice outdoor patio. I'm happy to see a new business in the area. Wonderful!

The staff accommodated our large party without a problem after Kabuki had a 90 minute wait. Food was tasty and diverse. Wait staff wasn't all on the same page though,  TV was pretty loud with the soccer game on and the food came out in intervals. Bathrooms are tidy and restaurant has a cool vibe. Didn't rush us and was great at splitting the checks up front.  Very sweet to give a birthday treat.

Fast but sloppier than other JJs, spread is normally contained to one half of the sandwich, which makes for a sad second half.

Our first experience was on a weekday, the food was quick and the service was about a 3. Lots of staff, however some are less stellar and you can see that other servers and bar tenders are not happy to have to make up for them. We had to ask for our player cards for the current promo- and the server was unaware even though we pointed it out prior to the close of our tab- she said she thought we should bring our receipts to the main counter. Another server came and asked us if we had received our cards and took it upon himself to get a manager (it ended up taking 3 managers) to resolve the problem since we'd already been cashed out. Good on the 2nd server- but very poor on the 1st. We also saw a bartender wipe away the extra foam from a beer with her HAND....
