Everyone knows that the tech market can be very volatile and looking for a job in todays market can be rather rough.  About 4 years ago, I found a company called TekSystems through monster.com, and they placed me rather quickly with a company.  I ended up not taking the position because I had found "permanent" work.  Oh - and they are right across the street from Fez... so you can go there after your interview for a drink.  I have been laid off 2 times in less than 2 years, and when my job options were looking bleak, I called up TekSystems again.  Within 4 days they had landed me a contract position for almost my previous salary level.  This company may hire me on permanently after my contract is up, and if not, TekSystem will place me somewhere else again.  These guys are great, and if you are currently out of work, and have technical skills, submit your resume.  These guys are helpful, friendly, and fast.

Imagine this - you are a contractor in a troubled economy.  You think your job is stable, you have a long term financial plan that depends on your job.  Then you get told your contract is getting cut by 3 months, which means in 2 months you will be out of a job.  Really not a bad thing.  2 months warning is enough time to find more work, right?  Imagine coming into work a week later, and getting told your contract was cut again.  This time, to the end of the month.  In this economy, you have to find a job in less than 3 weeks.  I was in this position.  I was getting offered job after job that I was overqualified for, at almost half my normal salary.  It was as if no one was hiring for my talent level.  Newspapers, Monster.com, Careerbuilder, temp agencies, even standing on a streetcorner with a sign and a cup.  Nothing really worked out.  Then along comes TekSystems, pushing for me to get into that one job that paid well, was a perfect fit for me, except that I didnt have a degree.  Thank you Marcia! Thank you Justin!  Thank you Kristen!  Thank you Derek!   Words cannot express enough what it means to have a dedicated team of people looking to help you out in any way they can.  If you need a job, and you are a tech, contact these guys.  They are unlike any other staffing agency I have ever worked for.  They genuinely care and are interested in your progression and the development of your career.

I have attempted to go to Oregano's 5 times.  I have actually eaten here 3 times.  The food was good, the parking is terrible.  I would be able to give this place 5 stars if I didnt have to fight for parking and a table.  I just can't see people waiting so long to eat here.  What is it that lures everyone in?  Someone message me and suggest a must try dish.  I have tried the wings, which were delicious, and a couple of the sandwiches.  The wait kills me every time.  For the parking section of the review I really wanted to check the "Yeah Right" box.  haha.

As my girlfriend explained to me on one of our several trips to this place, it is common in Japan for restaurants to server typical japanese food and the cuisine of another country.  Hence the Italian, and Japanese, cuisine.  Next time I go, I am going to order some italian, just to see if it is as good as everything else I have ordered there.  If you are going on a theme date, pair lunch here with the Japanese Friendship Garden.  A great alternative to Oregano's, since they are almost always slammed and have no parking!

As soon as I walked into this place, my mouth began to water.  The aroma in here just cant be beat.  I ordered the special - 1 16" pizza with 2 toppings and 30 wings.  Pizza toppings were Mushrooms and Onions.  I lamented this topping combo, but it was what my girlfriend wanted.  I got the wings hot, also ordered the Calzone sampler to try it out.  When I opened the wing box, the steam that rose from the box made my eyes and nose water.  It smelled so good I had to eat one right there at the counter.  One of the owners told me that the wings are even better if you eat them in house.  The next time I am in the area, I will try it out.  I took the pizza home and cracked open the box.  The mushrooms were thick, and the onions appeared at though they were cut by hand.  The sauce was rich, and the crust was perfect.  The calzones were great as well, smothered in marinara sauce.  The price was great, the people were friendly.  The lunch special can't be beat.  (2 slices of pizza and a free soda, 50 cent refills)  Negotiate the construction outside, find yourself a parking spot and get this pizza.  My only regret was that I had to share it.  Next time - its all mine.

Pizza?  Still just as great as I remember it.  Sausage and pepperoni.... mmmm.    The staff is always friendly, even when I have my 2 little monsters with me.  This time, when I went in, it seemed they had a house full of parents with their kids in tow.  We all sat close to one another as well.  The service really shines here, the server acknowledged both of my kids, asking them directly what they wanted to drink.  My 4 year old pretended to read the menu, as did my little mimic 2 year old, and he confidently ordered Sprite, with a smile.  I love it when servers know how to treat children.  I will be going back for sure.

Staff was courteous, but prices are high.  They also really messed up the crease on my slacks.  I am hoping that it can be fixed and that the fabric isn't damaged... but it will be fixed by someone else.

I wish I still worked close to this place so I could eat here every day.  I love the buffet, the atmosphere and the food.  I cant believe I drove right by it for years and never stopped in.  I was missing out.

I spent quite a bit of money on flowers here, and asked them repeatedly to send me a picture before they delivered it.  What arrived was truly pathetic for the money I spent.  I order flowers quite often, and I would avoid this place again.

I like this place.  There are so many flavors of ice cream here.  It's fresh, it's fattening, it's delicious.  I just have to say that this place reminds me of my grandparents.  Every time I eat here I sit back and think of the vague memory of my grandfather taking me to a soda shop in downtown Glendale, and taking me to some train park as a kid.  The world was simpler then.  I am greatful for the reminder of times long passed.

In 1999, I was discharged from the United States Marine Corps.  Keeping a high and tight well maintained was a real pain in the ass because barbers dont understand what the hell its supposed to be like.  I am sure that many of you who keep this style of haircut understand.  Any barber can sit you in a chair and cut your hair.  This guy used a razor to get skin close on the sides, and a leveler (no, I am not kidding) to make sure that the cut was even.  I have gone to at least 20 barber shops in the Phoenix, Mesa, and Tempe area.  This barber shop beats them all.  This is the BEST barber shop in Phoenix.  I have been a repeat customer for 9 years, and I will keep going back until they close up shop.

I have been to a couple Korean BBQ places around the valley so far, and this has been the best so far.  The wait staff was extremely attentive.  They were quick to point out what items might be a little to spicy for my children, and our drinks were never empty.  The meat was good quality, the pork was spicy and delicious, just enough to make your nose run, but not enough to send you screaming around the restaurant.  The beef was sweet and delicious.  They served 3 different kinds of kimchi with the meat, as well as other condiments.  I have to say, the radish kimchi was spot on for flavor, and by far my favorite.  I had to vote that this was not good for kids.  My daughter and son are very young though, and they are too tempted to play with the underside of the grill in the middle of the table, which my daughter was unfortunate enough to discover is very hot.  I would say kids over 7 should be fine, so long as they have the attention span to sit through the entire meal.  Definitely not for kids 6 and under.  We tried a little sushi, and it was decent, but really, who comes to a Korean BBQ place for sushi??  Excellent, and will be coming back here often.

The ladies that work here are always nice to my kids.  I got my daughter some boots for a great price - and in the back I found the clearance rack.  I got 6 pairs of pants for two of my kids for under 40 bucks.  These were not cheap pants either.  Western wear is not my thing, but I like Saba's.

I was just reminded of my horrible experience at this hospital when I was at a much better hospital this past weekend.  Years ago I came into this hospital because of severe eye pain following an eye surgery.  I was put in a bed and put in a dark room.  Everything was fine, until I noticed the smell.  The bed they had put me in was soaked with urine.  The sheets were clean when I laid down on the bed, but apparently someone had just put new sheets on a urine soaked bed.  Rather than apologize, the nurse on staff mentioned that "Sometimes people that come in that are in extreme pain wet themselves.  Its nothing to be embarassed about."  Really?  REALLY?  Absolutely disgusting.

I have been eating here since my jobless just moved out here from CA and don't want to go to college just yet days.  The quality of the food has remained consistent throughout the years.  I have had everything on the menu at least twice.  The chips are always fresh, the salsa is spicy but not to bad, the burritos are great (even the red sauce ones, and I don't like red sauce), the staff is always polite.  They open at 10:30 AM, so, its a little difficult to say its "breakfast" food, but yeah, I guess I could eat this for breakfast.  They do have a "drive up" window - but its for phone orders only!

I have been here twice, both times during happy hour, and I have to say that I disagree with most of the reviews here.  First off - I did valet my car.  A 2004 Kia Sedona.  There were people there with nice cars, but it was hardly a car show.  Yep, rich people drive nice cars.  Im not jealous.  I dont think the guy driving the Sentra in front of me in the Valet line was to concerned either.  Secondly - the women.  Yep.  There are lots of dressed up Scottsdale women here.  Lots of older guys too.  I tend not to pay attention to either when I go out, so I dont know how everyone was behaving.  I go with my girlfriend.  I will leave these comments to the people watchers.  Third - the food.  Sushi is pretty much all I eat when I come here.  I find it to be quite delicious.  I have been to dozens of sushi restaurants around Phoenix, Seattle, and California.  The sushi here is good.  Consistent quality, good selection.  The service - It can be a little difficult to get the waiters attention.  I think that has to do with what I am going to say next.  I think my only complaint is how loud the music has been on occasion.  When I am having to shout to talk to my girlfriend, or I cant hear the sushi chef talking 2 feet in front of me, its getting a little stupid.  I think whoever started the loud music trend at these hip restaurants should be publicly flogged.  Hearing aids arent on the menu.

All I can say is WOW.  First impression was the music.  Thank you for the volume level.  Loud enough to enjoy, not loud enough to overwhelm our conversation.  To many places these days that play something other than elevator music crank it up so loud you need earplugs to eat in peace.  The decor and style of the place was great.  I wish my house looked like this.  haha.  The staff was very friendly.  Everyone was smiling all the time, and we were taken care of very quickly.  I had a Bleu Cheese Balsamic burger.  It was amazing.  The pleasing zing of the balsamic glaze and melting bleu hit my nose before the burger even had a chance to wow me with its taste.  The salad was a nice compliment to the burger.  Fresh baby leaf spinach salad is my favorite, and the greens were fresh and crisp.  I love making bleu cheese burgers.  I grill them all the time at home.  Fez has this one down.  The taste just simply could not be beat.  My girlfriend had the Fez kisra.  She selected it randomly from the menu.  She commented that it was more food than she was expecting, and it was quite delicious.  We actually boxed this up and finished it later.  I didn't try the drinks, because I don't drink, but there are several items on the drink menu that were tempting me to try them out.  Maybe next time.  I can't wait.

Part of my romantic Valentines Day getaway with my girlfriend was a stop here.  A nice lesiurely stroll, watching the koi fish swim in the pond for a good 45 minutes.  Taking in the quiet and just relaxing.  The only thing that spoiled it was incessant noise from the people at the public park next door.  Without that, it would have been completely tranquil.  I can't blame the park for the noise from its neighbors, so it still gets 5 stars from me.  A traditional rock garden will be installed soon as well, I can't wait to see how it turns out!

I've got to say that I have eaten at many, many Chinese food places, and this place has excellent food.  I have sampled many spicy dishes, from the Yui Shan to the Curry, and all were great.  This restaurant has only a few downsides.  The decor is terrible, no kids menu (I am a parent of two), and a lack of high chairs (even though my kids are old enough to use booster seats).  I am strictly rating on quality of food here.  I would love to see them improve the interior of the restaurant to match the quality of the food, but with a full belly, I am not complaining!

Please do not fall for the IMAX trick here.  This is NOT a full IMAX screen.  I go to the Harkins IMAX all the time for movies, but they were sold out - so I bought tickets here.  What a rip off.  I drove from Chandler for this tiny screen?  Are you serious?  AMC is ripping people off.  Edit:  AMC Knows they are ripping people off and doesn't care!  This is a common thing for them around the country.  Google it.

Ive been eating here more and more often lately, and I like the food.  If I want Mexican food, and I am in the downtown chandler area, this is where I stop in.  The food quality is consistent.  Being a creature of habit, I get the same thing every time I come here.  They are also serving cupcakes.  Looks like the change the flavor every once in a while too.  I have had a margarita flavored one, and a dark chocolate and chili one.  Tasty.

This place is always great with kids.  My son hates having his haircut.  HATES IT.  He hates even having his hair touched.  I was really apprehensive about bringing him here, but he said he wanted a mohawk, so we went.  Well, he took scissors to his mohawk just so he could go back here.  To bad hes bald now, because he cut a little close.  It is going to be a while before we can go back.  Thank you Snip-its, I think...  You got my son over his fear of haircuts.  Good price for what you do.  I have never seen a kid leave this place sad.

I like wings.  I took the kids to eat here - 3 of the 4 - and my girlfriend.  We all ate for less than 30 bucks, with food to spare.  3 flavors in the family pack was good.  4 wings for each of the kids, two separate flavors, and hot for us.  The place is kind of small, so none of their tables seat more than 4.  That was ok though.  I have no complaints about this place.  When I want wings, this is one of the places I like to go to.

I went in here recently to look at a Prius.  Was a good experience, even though I couldnt get the car because I am to upside down on my van.  Sales staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and afterwards, when they knew I couldnt seal the deal, they didn't treat me like crap.  No high pressure garbage.  I walked away knowing I would have a hybrid one of these days.  Right after I get out from being upside down on my van.

I cant say that I really enjoyed having lunch here today.  The sushi was so so.  The mushroom tempura was actually pretty tasty, everything else, not so much.  I never really pay attention to the prices when I eat sushi, so I can't tell you how expensive it was.  I can tell you this - I have had better.  I think this is the first time I have had sushi that I couldnt actually taste the fish in the heavy sauces that were used.  The tea was really good, I didnt have to add sugar to it, which is not the norm for me.  I didnt have any drinks, which I should have, because I was already having a horrible day.  Kind of disappointing, I had been looking forward to this place since I saw them putting it in a while back.  Probably wont go back.

I am still in a daze and full from the meal I had here a few days ago.  Don't ask me what I had, it's all a fog now.  I just remember my terror at the enormous plate of delicious food that was placed in front of me.  I tried to escape, but I was caught in its gravitational pull.  Once I was able to consume enough to break away, then box the remainder... my terror was refreshed when my lunch date ordered an eclair for dessert.  I'm going to have nightmares about chocolate, whipped cream, custard and ice cream for a week.  Delicious nightmares.  Excuse me while I roll away from the computer.

On the outside, this place is great.  Here is my story.  I was at this place with a group of friends who were holding an event there.  Two of my friends, who happen to be gay, were trying to find a restroom.  There was an open door, so they went through it thinking maybe there was a restroom back there.  They were told it was an area for employees only, they apologized and said they were looking for a restroom, and then left the hall.  They went to go look somewhere else for the restroom, and they were stopped by an employee.  This employee radioed a manager after responding with disgust to the fact that they were holding hands.  Before you know it, there are no less than 5 employees, 2 of which were managers, around my friends, peppering them with questions and threatening to throw them out.  Mind you - we PAID to rent this place out.  They were *actually* looking for the restroom.  Nothing was out of place.  Except that it was two guys holding hands looking for a restroom.  After enough of us stood up and asked the management staff why they were giving our friends a hard time, the employee mob started to shrink down, and the manager left.  One of them obviously very pissed off.  My friends were not intoxicated, they were not agressive, they were two gay guys who happened to walk down the wrong hallway looking for a restroom.  The management staff was aggressive and rude.  Without cause.  It took 5 other people coming over to get them to back off.  You put it together.  This place will never see another dime of my money.

An update to this review.  After all this happened, the event organizers complained to the corporate office.  Apparently, the follow up to this was that the manager who was leading the charge on doing this was fired.  Good riddance.

I feel bad reviewing this place, because well... I will admit it.  I hate beer.  I don't drink it.  So if you're looking for something about the beer, I dunno, ask someone else.  I can tell you this though, the appetizers were great (except the wings!), the burger was awesome, and my glass was always full (of ice tea, cause that's how I roll at a brewery).  I would go back for the burger alone - especially at those happy hour prices.

I really love steak.  I really love prime rib.  I really wish I could form coherent thoughts about how good this steak was.  I can't.    You really have to try it out for yourself.  Now if you will excuse me, my drool is going to ruin my keyboard.

I have been here a couple times now.  I can't say that I have seen problems with service either time I was here.  The atmosphere in here is nice enough.  The workers were all smiles, and moved very quickly to get the orders out.  It was busy, but I was still able to find a seat and eat my lunch.  The problem that I had was with the food itself.  It wasn't bad, it was just... bland?  I ordered the Gyro plate, and it wasnt as good as I had hoped.  I have been to other Mediterranean restaurants, and the food seemed to have more flavor to it.  The pita was fine - but the Gyro meat was not very seasoned, and the rice was rather plain.  Maybe I will go back in a few weeks and give it another shot, just to see if things were off when I went these last few times.  It would be good to have tasty gyros near where I work.

I like the coffee here.  Its been good every time I go.  Sometimes the music is a little loud and I think thats a bit much - but maybe I am just getting old.  I don't know.  I actually like to have a conversation with the person I am there with.  Call me old fashioned, but the music doesn't need to send my drink flying off the table like I am in an 80's Maxell commercial.

I eat here often.  I too can't imagine what day Stephanie came in here.  The place is always moderately busy that I have seen.  I have stopped in at lunch, and dinner, and right before close.  The ingredients are fresh, no frozen shaved meat here.  They give you a small bowl, but even if you dont professionally stack your veggies, it is more than enough to eat.  Their seasoning layout could use a little improvement.  Finding the dry seasoning to follow the recipes can be a tad confusing (I never do this, but the people I bring here try).  The service leaves a little to be desired once you are actually seated.  Drinks will be waiting for you when you get back, and your food will be brought to you hot.  Good luck getting a drink refill before the check arrives!  Personally, I like this place better than YC's for two reasons.  They don't overuse their cooking sticks.  They add the sauce after the food is cooked.  One emergency room visit to remove a half inch splinter from the roof of my mouth was enough to make me NEVER go back to YC's Mongollian Grill again.  Adding the sauce after the food is cooked preserves the flavor of the sauce, and doesnt add your flavors to other peoples food.  Good idea.  This place knows how to do it right.  This place as a full bar... I am not sure why someone voted it as having no bar.

As far as mongollian grill is concerned, this place is the best in Phoenix as far as I am aware.  Hands down, this place has better quality ingredients, better service, and better atmosphere than any other place I have been in that is still in business.  My son loves to go here.  I have to direct him that its probably not a good idea to mix scallops with pepperoni, but he has a ton of fun.  He feels like he is helping to cook, just like at home.  The service here has always been great.  The people are smiling and friendly.  I get the same level of service and the same great food every time I come in here.  I love this place.

Updating from my previous review years ago.  Prices are higher.  Format changed.  Had a free bowl but didn't see the fine print that they won't apply it to a larger bowl.  Won't even discount the larger bowl.  2 dollars for tortillas that they didn't charge me for last week.  Sad, but I think I will cash in my freebie next week, and I'm done.  Sorry Genghis.  It's been great doing battle with you.

That 70's Shop and Hookah Lounge is a tobacco shop with a twist.  A decent selection goods ranging from tobacco and smoking accessories, to clothing.  I bought my brother a Led Zeppelin shirt here, and I told him to come back buy and pick up the AC/DC coaster set they have.  The shisha here is flavorful and smooth.  They sell 3 different brand names here, with dozens of flavors available.  The price seems a little higher than some if you go by the menu, but to be honest, when I come here and smoke I actually spend *less* than I do at other places.  Don't let the menu scare you off.  The owners are very friendly, helpful and talkative.  The music is good.  The only down side to this place, for me, is that the chairs are a little uncomfortable.  Other people I have brought here didn't seem to notice.  Sit down, enjoy a hookah with any selection off their custom flavors menu.  You will not be disappointed.

11 years ago, I joined the United States Marine Corps. Since that fateful day that I was scalped, I haven't needed another haircut outside of my standard issue cut.  About a 2 months ago, I decided to start growing it out again.  After all its been 11 years, time to try something new right?  So I let it grow.  I found out some things.  1.  My hair is wavy.  I dont remember it being this wavy.  I dont remember it having a natrual response of forming into the shape of a mohawk buzzed into my head by someone who had one two many and couldnt cut in a straight line.  2.  I have grey hair.  Right above my eye on the left side of my head  3.  I dont really like having hair on my head.  In an act of desperation, I went to Arizona Hair Co by the Tempe Marketplace.  My hair stylist was Kelly Dunlavey.    I havent actually had hair on my head in so long, that when she asked what I wanted, I said "I have no idea, just make it look decent."  This is all I could say outside of "Don't listen to me, shave my head, I dont want to see all this hair anymore."  Thankfully, she did just that.  She stopped me from shaving my head...  well... for this week anyway...

I didnt know where I was headed, so I passed the place.  I won't forget where it is now.  One of the above reviews mentioned unique flavors that push the envelope.  I dived right into one myself.  Dates and Bleu cheese.  What an amazing little treat for a cheese lover like me to find this flavor in an ice cream shop!  I did a double take and had to sample it!  Eating the ice cream was delicious.  You can't really begin to taste the bleu cheese until a few bites into a cup.  The sweetness of the dates really compliments cheese.  From sweet and creamy right into the aftertase of bleu cheese... wow.  If would say that if I was in the area, I would try another flavor, but I am totally hooked on this flavor now.

I was driving to a job training class, dreading having to attend because I have been fighting off a cold for 3 weeks. I am constantly losing my voice, and nothing really seems to work to prevent it besides a nice cup of hot tea.   Sick, unable to speak, and a little dizzy from all of the pills my doctors have me taking, I pulled into Dutch Bros. Coffee.   I couldn't really speak to get my order out, but they were patient with me. I chose a tea, and they actually suggested one that would be better for my sore throat.   They even added a little caramel and honey to it for me at no extra charge.   Thanks guys. You have definitely earned a repeat customer in me!

I was driving a minivan that got a whopping 12 miles to the gallon on average and was chewing through my checkbook like my mom on a cheesecake.  I wasn't going to trade it in, but just as my warranty expired, my brake problems that had been plaguing me since the day I bought the vehicle used came to a head.  With my kids in the car, I pushed on the brakes, and they were VERY slow to respond.  Fortunately, no accident.  Unfortunately, the brake problem that the dealership insisted was nothing, over and over again, was now a 2,500 dollar + issue.  The dealership, of course, was more than happy to "fix" at full price.  At this time, I decided enough was enough, and I went to go trade the van in.  For the past 10 years or so, I had driven vehicles as dictated by ex wives, and I was also fed up with that!  So I decided I was going to get something sporty.  I got myself into a 2008 Chevy Cobalt Sport.  Awesome.  Brown and Brown Chevrolet, I will sing the praises of your finance department to the ends of the earth.  But, as they say in the Conan movies, "that is another story".  I went home and I called GEICO.  I had been a customer of theirs for 5 years, and I have a perfect driving record.  I was paying only 98 bucks a month on my van.  I shouldn't get THAT much of an increase for my sporty new car.  It was in about 30 minutes or less, that I learned just how much money I wouldnt be saving on my Auto Insurance if I stayed with GEICO.  98 bucks suddenly turned into 290 bucks a month, with a 420 dollar down payment.  I called them and asked them to check this out about 4 times.  They said there was nothing they could do.  I was desperate, and my required balloon payment was right around the corner.  I had no idea that now, on top of a higher car payment, my insurance payment was going to triple and then some.   In comes the hero of the day, Scott Thomas.    For a very small increase in my monthly payment on my van, Scott was able to line up auto insurance coverage that blew GEICO and other insurance companies away.  I was astonished at how much money I saved by switching AWAY from GEICO.  The entire time I was in his office, his office staff kept my children entertained with movies and snacks.  They didnt want to leave!  Thank you Scott Thomas and staff.  You provided me with customer service and great rates that went beyond anything I could have expected otherwise.

From 2008 to... almost 2013.  I still give Scott 5 stars.  He, and his staff, are excellent.  I have referred several people to this office, and they all receive the same service.  Scott takes care of not only my car and renters at a great rate, he also takes care of several members of my family as well.  4 years, and not a single drop in the level of customer service.

Been here a couple of times, food is always great, service is always great.  What more can I say?  Eat here.  I would say try a specific item, but honestly I haven't had one yet that was bad.

I have to say, I agree with Cher on this one.  I really liked this place.  The food was very tasty, and the staff was very friendly.  I moved from the area shortly after finding it, but I would probably stop back by if I was in the area again.

Let me just start out by saying that I loathe to call this place a barber shop.  It was Sunday.  I had my kids all weekend, and I had grabbed a few hours while they spent time with my parents to rush out and get a haircut.  The place I normally go was in Mesa, and that was too far a drive.  Other barber shops I had been to in the past had no Sunday hours.  I happened to remember a relatively new shop that had opened up.  It started of normally, it looked and smelled like a barber shop.  No biggie.  Two barbers were working, and it was taking quite a long time (well over an hour) for them to finish up with the people they were working on.  This sums up my first impression really - It looks like a good barber shop.  They appear to be spending a lot of time on their customers haircuts, which must mean they care about quality work.  I could come back here.  This impression was shattered the moment I sat in the chair.  I should have known when he casually tossed the black death shroud over me that I was no longer at at barber shop, but at a funeral parlor for my hair.  So what do you want today?  He casually asked.  I explained that I was trying to grow my hair out, so I just needed a trim.  So started the electric razor with its familiar hum, then I was reminded of a scene from Star Wars.  "I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced."  The voices that were screaming must have been my hair because what happened over the next 20 minutes left me speechless.  It started out like normal, and then something went horribly wrong.  I had not seen my hair yet, but I could tell just by the way he was cutting.  What the hell happened to the experienced barber that was beautifully sculpting a short haircut not just 5 minutes prior to me sitting down?  I know, as barbers go, it takes more skill to do a short cut then it does to do a long cut.  I am a complete pain in the butt when it comes to my standard haircut.  In the end, after checking my hair twice, I actually told him it was fine just so I could escape any more damage.  When I picked up the kids, I knew it was bad.  My mother looked right at me and said "What the hell is that?"  My dad said "I have seen you with a lot of haircuts since you were a kid, and this is by far the absolute worst haircut I have ever seen."  You know its bad when your mom makes you sit down and she grabs a pair of scissors to fix it, and actually makes it look BETTER.  I will not be going back, and I would suggest that you dont either.  Trust me.  Your hair will thank us both.

I am going to start this off by saying that my past experience with Pho has been less than satisfying.  I didnt really think I would like the stuff on the third try, but I am one of those kinds of people that is too stubborn to dislike food and I have to keep trying it.  You know - just in case the places I ate at before were terrible.  Today, that mentality served me well.  I had avoided the previous tenants of this particular location like the plague, due to their reputation for poor customer service, etc.  New company, new attitude.  The wait staff was very attentive and polite.  There was light classical music playing.  The restaurant was very clean.  I had the Pho Tai Bo Vien with Jasmine Hot Tea.  The tea was hot - but not so hot that I couldnt begin drinking it right away.  The Pho was delicious.  Not to greasy.  Very flavorful.  The sprouts and basil that were served with it were fresh and crisp.  All in all, for 11 bucks, this was a good meal.  There are many other items on the menu that I would like to try, and the manager informed me that the menus is being expanded.  I will update this review in a few weeks.

I can't really review the beer selection because I don't drink, but I come here for wings quite often.  I usually get 10 original hot and 5 of some random flavor.  The wings are delicious, right level of heat for me, and out of the dozens of times I have been here I have never been disappointed.  With the recent break away from the franchise I have not seen a drop in quality of the food.  I think its actually improved.  The wait staff is always on top of my tea and gives me an extra glass of ice when its fresh brewed and still warm.  Awesome.

I normally don't pay much attention to the flyers left on my door, but my kids twisted my arm because they wanted pizza.  I looked at the prices listed, and they were pretty comparable to the big boys, so I gave it a shot.  I am glad I did.  This pizza was excellent.  I couldn't really describe it, but my friend who ate the pizza with me the last time we ordered said "It reminds me of home, that one little pizza shop around the corner back in PA.  This is some good stuff."    The people are really friendly.  They are always willing to talk, and treat each customer well.  At any point I have been in there, they are always chatting with the customers, making sure they are taken care of.  Not like the big guys in this neighborhood that hide behind glass windows and avoid customers like the plauge.  This place is also very clean - on the 3 occassions I have walked in, the floor was swept, and the employees were wearing gloves to top the pizzas.  I am a big fan of supporting the mom and pop shops - and let me tell you - I will support this one for as long as I am in the area.  I do have to warn you, when the pizza is not excellent - it is still pretty good - but it is a mom and pop shop, so sometimes the pizza isnt as good as the last time.  I really consider that part of the charm.  This isn't your typical assembly line pizza.

I was walking around my usual haunt and I noticed that Slices had opened up shop near the movie theatre.  Some people may be familiar with the slices on 6th St. and Mill.  I have always wanted to try this place, but it always seems to be closed.  I ordered a slice of the chicken pesto pizza and a coke.  The pizza was crisp and delicious.  The feta gave it an awesome zip.  My only complaint was that it was kind of dirty.  I was brushing parmesean cheese off everything I sat on the counter, and my pants since it was on the seats as well.  I will still be going back.  That spicy chicken pizza looked to good to pass up.

This store is run by the same people that ran Hannoush Jewelers at Chandler Fashion Center mall.  I wont give them a dime of my money.  Yeah, I am still bitter about the 700 dollars I was not refunded from their now closed store.

I went into the shop and hand picked the flowers.  They were all very busy, and still took the time to talk to me and be very courteous and friendly.  I really felt like I got more than I paid for when all was said and done.  They did an amazing job so quickly and I never felt like an inconvenience (at the time I certainly was).  The flowers were impressive, and they lasted a really long time.

I am totally shocked that this dentist doesn't have a review yet.  Come on people!  Giant needles?  Bright lights?  Drills in your teeth?  That sound that it makes when it goes into your less than pearly whites?!  Who doesn't want to write a review about painful cavities?  Fun stuff!  I have been going to this dentist for years now.  The staff has always been courteous, and they always return my phone calls.  I also like that Dr. Nadkami is available for dental emergencies after hours - and will call you back if she doesn't answer!    They have gone above and beyond for not only me, but also for my children.  My kids do not fear going to the dentist - in fact, Dr. Nadkarni goes out of her way to make it fun for them, and only does a small amount of work per session so that they don't get stressed out.

I like the prices on the supplements I use here.  The staff is knowlegeable and not pushy.  I followed their recommendations for supplement changes when I hit a plateau in my training and it worked like a charm.

These guys helped my brother out with supplements when he came in, and I felt confident sending him there because they are knowledgeable.  The guy behind the counter remembers my kids and the fruit smoothie flavors they like.  That's pretty awesome.

I could post like everyone else about how awesome the seats are and stuff - but I will share this instead.  My son has type 1 diabetes, and we weight out all of his food and keep a close count on his carbs.  I got to the theater and realized the battery had died on my portable scale. They asked what I was trying to do - weighed the fries out for him and put them in a separate container on his own tray.  The staff won me over big time.

Went back last night with the girlfriend to give it one more shot.  Lukewarm french fries, and again, I was not impressed with the burgers.  The people that work there are friendly enough, but I guess I am just not a fan.

I bought a mattress from this place a year ago and never got around to reviewing them.  Buying through them saved me over 1000.00 off retail, and my mattress has been great!  I used the 90 day financing option, and paid it off in a month.  Don't take this option unless you can pay it off on time!  Knowledgeable staff, very nice to my kids.  I have been recommending them for a long time now.

I found a sweet deal of a sale on this black wool jacket that I couldn't pass up on.  It is Arizona, and on the 3 days out of the year we can wear such a fashionable jacket - we should do so.  Much to my chagrin, the jackets sleeves were too long.  No.  I do not have short stubby little arms and a big thick fat neck.  Stop staring at me.  I'm a unique snowflake.  Anyway, so I took the jacket to Gemma's paid the 35 or 40 bucks to get the sleeves shortened (is this expensive?  I don't know, I pay 20-30+ for my pants to get tailored elsewhere.  Don't really care either.  I'll pay well for good service.)  Was given a timeline of one week.  Standard from what I have seen - and acceptable considering how busy the shop was with beautiful brides (when I say beautiful, I mean... wow.  If I was a cartoon character, my jaw would have hit the floor and my eyes would have popped out.  If either of my wives looked like these amazing ladies I might still be married.  Maybe.)  The jacket was ready on time - but get this.  I was not.  I forgot to pick the stupid thing up.  Up until I had to leave to go on a trip for work - and I needed the jacket THE NEXT DAY.  Gemma actually stayed LATE for me to get my jacket.  I called her at 10 minutes to close, and she stayed late for me to pick up my jacket because I, the idiot customer, was in a rush.  I am sure this is the exception, not the rule, but still - customer for life.  Oh, and in case you are wondering - the first person who saw me in my jacket was my 2nd ex wife, and she insulted me - so I know I looked damned good and extra smoking hot in it.  Jealousy is a bitch.  Thank you Gemma.

Pretty empty when I strolled in at 8:00.  Free wifi.  Got a hot chocolate because I am already jacked up on rockstar to the point that I am sweating.  Not a super sweet chocolate - but I don't like super sweet so that's just fine with me.  This isn't a dig - I didn't ask for more chocolate when offered.  Cant really try the sandwiches because I am not hungry.  I will come back for that maybe this weekend.  This place has only been open 3 weeks so far - I am a little shocked at these other reviews.  I would offer polite feedback.  These "teenage kids" are very open to suggestions and quite friendly.  The owner isn't here, but I sure would like to see this place survive.  I see potential here, in an area that has little to no coffee shops.

Donuts are decent quality, but lacking items like bear claws.  I thought that was a staple.  Also got my order wrong, but I didn't check it before I left, and I ate it anyway because mmm donuts.

I have been looking for a barber shop on this side of town that delivered the same quality haircuts I was looking for after being spoiled by Richard D's in Phoenix for so many years.  This place was it.  Clean, sharp haircuts for me and my son every time.  The price is right where it should be, and the service is great.  If you are in the area, I would recommend avoiding the chains and head into Two Guys.  They do an excellent job.

I just moved in.  I read some of these reviews and I decided to move here anyway.  First impressions.  Nice apartment.  Quiet.  I've heard some music in the halls.  I've heard some loud people at night.  This is near the ASU campus, so I expect a bit of that.  Vomit in the elevators - I have seen none.  All of the elevators smell like air freshener.  They are all clean.  Carpets seem clean in all the halls.  Concrete is a little dirty... But people walk on it so I am not surprised.  They are actively cleaning it.  Neighbors are nice.  People are friendly.  Office staff is nice.  Dog owners are nice.  Dogs are nice.  Place does not smell like dog poop like previous reviews have stated.  Parking garage.  Holy crap you people drive so fast.  No wonder they put in speed bumps.  Slow down there, speedy.  No wonder your alignment is messed up.  Not supposed to drive 30 mph in a 5 mph zone.  Its a parking garage but I feel like I'm playing Frogger.  I am not getting a rent discount.  I didn't see anything for yelp reviews for rent discounts.  I will be updating this with honest information as I go along over my entire lease.  I can't be bought.  Also, enjoying my first apartment event.  Free pizza and wings.  Also enjoying a free cafe mocha.

I have officially lived in skysong for about a month.  Still no vomit in the elevators.  People clean up after their pets.  The property is clean and well maintained.  The maintenance staff is cordial and has been working diligently to fix any issues, no matter how small, since I moved in.  A second event that I attended was pretty neat.  Free pancakes.  mmmm.  I really like the event coordinators.  They are very nice.  No problems with the office staff.   Trash cans are not overflowing.  Oh!  I heard someone the other day being loud.  It was around 1 am, and some drunk people were coming home from a bar.  You know... just like every other apartment complex with common areas.  Hmmmm... I will keep reviewing...

Another update:  Maintenance is always on top of things, and are friendly and professional.  Office staff:  Always friendly.  I pick up packages and they are nice.  I run into them around the property and they are nice.  I see them when they are leaving work, and they are nice.  No problems there.  I do have some noisy neighbors, but am I going to give the complex a rating hit because of the actions of the residents?  No.  Its not the apartment complexes fault my upstairs neighbor has a kid with a hoverboard that he rides everywhere instead of walking.  All.  Night. And. Day.  back and forth.  Zooooom THUMP... ZOOOOOM  THUMP.  JUST WALK KID.  You're gonna break your face falling off that stupid thing.  The complex recently sent out a notice about how people should leave their trash in the halls in containers.  It needed to be said.  What the heck is wrong with you people?  You people can't seem to get the concept of trash valet or trash chutes.  You put your trash out during specific hours, you bring it back in before a specific time.  Not rocket science.  OH.  And the trash goes in the chute.  Not all around it in piles because you're too damn lazy to use a handle.  Jibbers Crabst.  You live here.  Have some pride.  Stop making the place a mess.  Help keep it clean for your idiot neighbors who don't have a clue.  Oh?  And the speed bumps?  Considering some jerk with California plates almost slammed into me going 30 miles an hour in the damn parking garage, I would say we need more speed bumps.  Bigger speed bumps.  Maybe automated missile turrets that only go off when people drive over 15 miles an hour in a parking garage.  Robot sentries?  I am playing to much Fallout.

I have tried to like this place.  I don't have a problem with the office staff.   The problem with this community it is clearly the residents.  For the price I am paying, I cannot believe the stupidity of the residents here.  1.  The pool isn't heated.  It hasn't been in the 6 months I've lived here.  It's constantly ice cold.  2.  The fire pit.  What a joke.  It's always broken because the residents break it.  They actually cracked open the part that is supposed to ignite the gas and used it as an ashtray.  They put food in the fire pit.  They leave the grills trashed and barely functional.  No sooner are they fixed than some drunken frat boy and his stupid friends decide to burn the packaging for their beer on the grill and leave it caked with food and excessive amounts of whatever they put on the food before they charred it to a crisp in a drunken stupor.  3.  The residents.  Leaving trash in piles next to the chutes.  Leaving garbage in bags next to their doors instead of in bins.  Glass in the pool area.  Smoking and throwing butts into the landscaping in a non-smoking complex, of course.  (Super smart idea.  Let's just burn the place down.  Idiots.)  4.  Dog policy?  Apparently dogs barking until 2 am is cool because it's a month of incessant barking and you do nothing about it.  Edit:  One of them finally stopped.  5.  Garage doors.  Always broken.  Always.  Again, I have to say this is because of the residents.  They ram the gates, or hit them coming home drunk at 3 am.  Whatever the case, again - not the fault of the complex.  They are fixed and the next day someone has broken them again.

Waited for an hour and a half for a table.  Finally left and went somewhere else.  The people who were eating looked like they were enjoying it.  Can't fault them for being so busy.  4 stars because people who were leaving had huge smiles on their faces.  The staff was great to us while we waited.  Really wish I could have had some.  haha

I liked this place.  Cant beat the price.  Sometimes the blowers don't get all the spots... but uh... they never do.  At any car wash I have ever been to, ever.  Seriously.  Also, the staff gave me towels when I asked, and they were super nice.  Really, how can you complain about this?  A great deal and good staff.
