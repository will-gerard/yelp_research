When it comes to fine hotdoggary, look no further.  UNIX has the philosophy of: "Do One Thing and Do It Well."  I guarantee you they stole that from Ted's as Ted's has been doing that since 1927, and UNIX only since '69.  They charcoal broil their dogs, which gives them an awesome flavour.  I have never been disappointed by a trip to Ted's, and I bet you won't be either.  They have plenty of parking, lots of seating, and several options and variations for you.  I brought my little nephew when they visited from out of town...he loved a place devoted to the hot dog.

We all know the brand "Victoria's Secret."  How could you miss the adverts of women in their underwear with wings?  They have a great product.  What is awesome about the Scottsdale Fashion Square location is the customer service and level of attention to detail.  It can be awkward for a man to walk into a lingerie store to shop for his significant other.  However, the staff here are always super friendly, extremely helpful and definitely above all else, professional.  I appreciate their help and will definitely go back.

I have used the services of both locations (the other being Tempe).  The service was consistent at the Phoenix office with that of which I received in Tempe: Awesome. My review for the Tempe location I believe can directly apply here.  So, as all great men do, I will quote myself: "THINK! is the place to go in the Phoenix Metro for your printing needs.  I have used them in the past and was extremely satisfied by the fast service, great pricing, and multiple options available to me.  On top of the superb product offerings they provide top notch customer service.  I will definitely use them again, and would highly recommend them to anyone.  I have used THINK! on several occasions and the level of service and product have been consistently awesome."

I'll start with the positive.  They have some friendly members of staff.  That's it.  You might catch a staff infection here, so watch out.  It's like a shack that somehow got a bar licence.  I have a friend who drags me here on occasion as it's his favourite dive.  It's one wrong glance away from a fight, every time.  If you like the danger and excitement of drinking a beer in a building that may collapse on you, go for it.  If not, avoid the dregs of society and go somewhere else.

Le Chalet est génial! If you don't speak French, that means it's awesome...and it is.  Crêpes, Fondue and ambiance.  Le Chalet has it all.  I have had the Fondue, and both savoury and desert crêpes.  All were wonderful. If you're looking for a bit of the French Alps on a "stay in Phoenix" budget then put Le Chalet on the top of your list.

This is a real Irish Pub.  It's not some cheap, Irish-themed sports bar where the most authentic thing on the menu is "Irish-Nachos."   Johnny Fox's, like Robbie Fox's (Tempe), has got it right: great food that is traditionally themed, great service and great craic (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craic). It's a good place to just grab drinks or have a nice meal.
