Staying at The Pointe Hilton had a craving for pizza. This place was worth the call and they delivered right to our room. Better than Pizza Hut or Papa Johns if you want something different. We had the large pizza and wings special for about $25 and added the New York White with a total of $48. The wing hot sauce is so good and the pepperoni had a good flavor also. I gave it 5 stars because it seems like this place is underrated.

NEVER AGAIN  will I ever go back to this place. The security staff are a bunch of rude douche bags that feel the need to push and shove women out when it's time to close. WHEN THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE INSIDE. We were there early and had to pay $5 because "national act" was performing. Why come up to people that have been there and ask to pay but whatever. It was the most horrible experience and it was mostly the security's fault. Don't go there if you have a group of people and just want to have fun. They apparently don't condone that.

I always get good service going through the drive-through mostly. I hardly ever have to wait since this is the less busiest location. I've never had a bad experience.

I am giving 5 stars to our server. Being a Saturday afternoon we did have to wait but Camille was the best. With all of the chaos she was the sweetest. The food runner messed up on our order but she made sure we got the correct items sent.  The food was good too. We got the king crab legs with the garlic seasoning and the shrimp with the hot n juicy. Both flavors were great.  I would go back for Camille and the food.
