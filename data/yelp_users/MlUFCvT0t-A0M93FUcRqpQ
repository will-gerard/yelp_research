One of the best in Phoenix. They did a really good job repairing and setting up a guitar for me, for a low price. I had the guitar back within a couple of hours.  The guys who work there and run the place are way nicer than what you expect from most music store employees. They never hassle you or tell you not to touch guitars etc. This place is highly recommended.

This is one of the best salons in Phoenix. All of the stylists  here are VERY good, and some are quite well known.  Ask for Ariel as she used to be an instructor at Paul Mitchell and is highly skilled with color as well as being an extremely talented cutter. They also give you a really amazing neck and scalp massage at this place when you get your hair cut here. That alone is worth coming here. Great ambiance! I would recommend Atmosphere over any other salon in the area.

"The price you see advertised on the internet isn't really the asking price." I had a terrible experience attempting to purchase a car here. They had a used car listed on their website for 4,000 (the cheapest car on their lot.) I took it for a test drive and decided to buy it for cash for the full asking price without any haggling. It was then they informed me that they would be adding almost 30% to the price in "fees." I have bought many used cars from dealers and in my experience they will almost always give you the sticker price out the door(give or take a few hundred.) However, this place wanted to charge me more than 25% in addition to the sticker price. A car they were advertising for 3988, they wouldn't let me have for less than 5100! The salesperson was totally useless and was able to do absolutely nothing for me, despite the fact that I had cash in hand and was ready to purchase at the full asking price. I can't believe they would nickel and dime someone for the cheapest car on their lot. If they were not going to let the car go at the asking price (or relatively close to it) they should not have been advertising the vehicle at that price, as it is deceptive and something of a bait and switch. The manager actually came out to talk to me and actually made an outrageous statement. He said "I know you think that because you saw it advertised for that price on the internet, that that's the asking price...but that isn't really the asking price." Can you believe that? He told me they were already losing money on the car(it's not my fault they paid too much for it.) I even came back the next day to see if they could reduce the fees even a little bit, and they said no. I will never purchase from another chevy dealership again. Be aware that if you see a car advertised on their website, they most likely will try to charge you 25-30% in fees on top of that price before letting you have the vehicle.

Been coming here for many years as I only live a couple blocks away. This is a great place to get a couple slices of pizza for just a few bucks. Service has always been fast and friendly, and the pizza is one of the better ones in the valley despite being inexpensive. Same employees have been working there for as long as I have been going there. Not much seating, but it's not that kind of place really. I always get my food to go. The only drawback is that it is literally hot as hell inside the place which is fine in winter but not so much in summer.

This is one of the worst run grocery stores in town. They got rid of the self checkout option, so now their check out is soooo slow. It takes forever, and there is at most one or two lanes open. They seem totally oblivious to this. I can't tell you the amount of times I've come here on my lunch break to buy something to eat, and ended up throwing it back on the shelf because the checkout was too long of a wait. If you just need to buy like one thing you always get stuck behind someone buying a ton of groceries. Often the express line is closed.  To make matters worse, the person who bags the groceries always has to comment on nearly every item you're buying, "oh are you getting this because you have an ear infection." I can't imagine this would be a good place if you had to buy personal items. No respect for privacy.  If you want to see how a checkout system should be run, I'd recommend you go to the Fry's on 20th st. and Camelback, which has 20 times the amount of shoppers, but never a wait.  The only reason I even give this Albertsons 2 stars, is because of the Starbucks within the store, where the service and employees are terrific.

Legit place. For years, I used to sell all my precious metals to Don Demarest at the Antique Centre in Scottsdale, but the shop closed down a couple of years ago and I had to locate another vendor. After doing a bit of research, I contacted Valley Goldmine since they had the best reputation among all the gold buyers I looked into locally. They are by appointment only, but I managed to get an appointment the same day I called and walked out with a check for a few hundred bucks. Valley Goldmine is up front about how much they pay, percentage wise. They payout better than most places locally and to get more you'd probably have to mail your gold to one of the online dealers. Who really wants to do that? I had a good experience with them and would recommend them as an honest dealer.

This is really a terrific place to get a massage, and it's very convenient. You can just walk in whenever while you're in the mall and grab a quick 20 or 30 minute massage. They are very skilled and can find trouble spots without even me saying anything. They seem to be able to figure out where the source of the tension is. Before I started coming here, I had really bad elbow tendinitis, and after a few sessions my elbow barely even bothers me anymore. The massage therapists are all very friendly and always seem happy to see you when you come in. I've been here probably 30 or 40 times and never had a bad experience.
