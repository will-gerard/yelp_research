This place is wonderful and I can be found here on a weekly basis.  I think my car just takes me there on auto pilot by now.  Great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, coffee, and dessert.  I also enjoy the wi-fi option from time to time for work or fun.  The staff are great as are the owners.  I love the Best Chicken Sandwich, sweet potato salad, Far East Salad with Chicken, Biscuits and Gravy, scrambled eggs, Salt Bar, Bread Pudding and many more.  Also, you HAVE to use the bathroom while you are here, just so fun.  I love the joint sink area and the, uhmmm, variety of the bathroom stalls.

I have once again managed to eat at Liberty twice in one day.  I love how the weekends serve breakfast late so when I skip breakfast for Yoga class I can still get my egg fix.  And oh did I.  Love the American scramble and the trick is to ask for a side of gravy for that delicious biscuit.    However it was my dinner experience that inspired me to write an updated review.  A few firsts, sat at the coffee bar and was served table side--very nice.  Had the salmon special with a potato cake and mustard sauce which was awesome, love their specials.  However it was the post meal coffee that was life changing.  I am quite the coffee snob and am rather picky about where and how I have coffee.  Last night I wanted a little something sweet (the chocolate truffle cookie) and a small shot of espresso.  I was first going to ask for the Cubano but the Barista suggested the Cortadito.  WOW!  That little cup of goodness had escaped my radar but now I can't stop thinking about it.  So rich and lightly sweet with a nice foam. I know that it has dairy in it, steamed half and half I believe so nothing but the best of dairy, but for me it is just a small amount so I am willing to suffer the consequences and take an extra sinus pill.

Of course no one wants to use this place by choice but if you need the extra care for your pet the staff here have been very professional, helpful and supportive.  I have mainly worked with Dr. Wood and Lindsey and they have been very helpful and supportive while I have managed my cat's illness.  Also the emergency vet Dr. Tan was very supportive to us when Dr. Wood was out of town.    I appreciate that they talk with you about your options, the pros and cons, and let you guide the next steps at your comfort level.  It is always hard to be in a position to make serious health choices about a pet and I was very pleased with how the medical staff help you through this process.  Thank you.

Met a friend here for dinner.  I had been here once before when it first opened and had not been back since.  What a great menu, so many pork choices that I was overwhelmed and trying to hide my drool.  I asked the waitress to help me choose which pork dish would satisfy my carnivorous craving and she pointed me to the tenderloin.  I have to admit at first the description with chocolate espresso rub and vanilla bean butter sauce sounded a bit too fussy for me but she did not steer me wrong.  It was very good and I like that they do not give you too much food, well portioned.  Including some dishes offer a full or half-size order.  We topped of our wonderful conversation with some chocolate dessert, Mexican Chocolate Torte.  I loved it.  My friend ate the ice cream being that I don't eat dairy and she said it was good.

This is the only place I can get my favorite beer on tap, Tripel Karmeliet from Belgium.  They also have a good selection of local beers and just a good variety on tap overall.  The food is very good for bar food and I can easily overeat my way through their menu, especially during happy hour.  They have a separate gluten free menu.  I do not eat diary and they are very accommodating to leaving off any items on request.

Good place when you have a mixed group of Sushi and non-Sushi eaters.  They offer a gluten free menu and are accommodating at making changes to your order.  I particularly enjoy the Blood Orange martini, or two, and the Salmon Special Roll.    However because they are a chain restaurant they recently changed their menu based on the nationwide popular choices.  For me that means no more Hana Salad which I loved, and my partner was sorry to see one of their noodles dishes go, but he has learned to order a new noodle dish and ask them to make it with Ramen noodles.

A few friends and I went to this place and before going in asked about a gluten free menu (I have a friend who cannot eat gluten).  We were informed that they do not have a gluten free menu but the wait staff can point out which items can be made gluten free.  Okay, sounds good.  We decide to eat there.  We sat out on the patio, which was very nice and not too hot with the misters going even in the heat of summer.  However when our waitress finally came over to talk to us about the menu the first thing she pointed out as gluten free was the one pasta dish on the menu.  Realizing that there is a disconnect on what it means to be gluten free she said she would check with the chef.  She returns to say no on the pasta (okay good call) and then proceeds to say that one of the salads would be good.  However the salad had blue cheese on it, which is not gluten free.  So, we realized quickly that they had no clue what it means to be gluten free and she was safer ordering the lobster with butter.    I ordered the steak, since that is what they are know for, and was disappointed that it was overcooked and rather salty for my taste.  I would have asked to return it except that it took so long to get that steak and I had already witnessed the table next to us send something back to the chef (the Kobe burger which was undercooked for that table) and it took forever for them to return with a new order.  I sucked it up and just ate it.    Overall I felt the place was over priced and poorly staffed.  Our waitress did not seem knowledgeable about the menu and as I stated earlier it did not appear that anyone understood how to accommodate a gluten free diet--after being told they could.  Plus the waitress was not slammed with tables and yet did not seem to be available to us or other tables for questions or refills.  I had high hopes since this is a Fox restaurant and I like so many of their places, but was very disappointed.  I doubt I would go back to this place and given it was not full on a Saturday night I don't think I am the only one who feels that way.

I have had coffee all over AZ (and other states) and this is my second favorite place in AZ.  As far as Phoenix goes this is #1!  I love their coffee and tea.  The cookies and other baked goods are also wonderful.  Plus the staff is great.  Hayes has done a wonderful job making this a cozy eco-friendly place.

Tried this place yesterday for lunch and really enjoyed it.  I had the Green Chili Pork with the corn tortillas (just like corn better).  The pork had great flavor and spice.  I did request a small cup of their extra spicy salsa, which actually had a hint of sweetness to it but good.  I liked the beans and rice as well.  The horchata was very tasty and a good balance to my lunch.    For those not into meat I was there with a veggie eater and he enjoyed the no lard black beans with the veggie tacos (again corn tortillas here to avoid animal products).    I will be back to try another dish here for sure.  Also, it is nice that they have free parking in the back instead of filling the meter.
