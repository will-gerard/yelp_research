Voted BEST in the area for everything! The Raspberry Chipotle Boneless wings are SO Yummie! . The menu is varied-- whtever you are craving , it's there. The portions are more than generous; you won't leave hungry! The kitchen is open late---The staff is very friendly and attractive. We really enjoy the live music at CK's-- especially Chuck E. Baby and the All-Stars--

Tried Thai Rama in Chandler for the 1st time.( Chandler Blvd/ Dobson.) The place is small, clean, nicely decorated and comfortable. I'm not very familiar with Thai food, but was feeling adventurous and was craving spicy... I asked the friendly Thai waitress for some suggestions and she explained that you can order most of the entree items with your choice of meat or seafood, or even tofu as your protein choice.  Plus you can order with different degrees of spicy and they have chili sauce, and red chile powder and jalape√±os on the side, to "add heat".  I started with a  spicy grated papaya salad...EXCELLENT! Also try the Thai Jasmine tea. Nice subtle flavors.  After a few questions and the suggestion of my server, I also tried a wonderful curry dish called "Evil Jungle Princess". A creamy, red curry dish with veggies, served with rice (also available with noodles) and I chose tofu as the protein. I ordered "Med hot" and that was just fine , because I added the red chile powder to heat it UP to my desired level. (hint: You can't really tone it down if you order it too spicy, but you can always add more spice , if it's not)....The Evil Princess was absolutely delish! Anything BUT evil! I am still thinking about this sweet princess!  It was a very quiet night and the service was a little slow, but I was in no hurry.  The food was prepared fresh to order. and I really enjoyed the new dining experience. This locale has a drive up window for  phoned in to-go orders and I understand they do a booming biz for lunch. I WILL be back and I am bringing people with me! I think a big party could order different items from their vast menu, and everyone could try a little bit of this, a little bit of that....I loved this place and I encourage you to try it!

We stayed here only because a wedding we attended took place here. We were part of the wedding party. We reserved two rooms. We were told that since the wedding was at 4, we could have early check-in, to get ready for the wedding.  They lied,   Other friends and family were told the same thing, and were treated the same way.  When we arrived at 11am, we were told that the earliest we could check in was 4pm!  I told them that was impossible, because the wedding was at 4, AND THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT. The staff at the front desk really did not care. They were rude . They did not even try to solve the problem. Only after begging and pleading for a couple of hours did we finally get a room at 2:30pm. We were told that we could only use the room just to change in. It was the WRONG room and did not fit our family, The " witch-with a b" at the front desk acted as if she was doing us a favor by letting us use it.   The front desk never followed up on getting us the correct rooms,. We actually never got the 2nd room, so after the wedding reception, half of our party had to leave and stay elsewhere.  Room service food was horrible, cold, burnt, and over priced. The food in the restaurant was awful, too. They also over-charged us for the room that we used. I can't recommend this place to anyone.  This is a shame because it is a really nice facility,....but with a really terrible staff.   The only person that was nice to us was the bellman.  Room Tip: Tip: Stay somewhere else.

Friendly atmosphere...great prices...great food ( rib night on wed-- $8.95 for a 1/2 rack dinner!) and the gyros are huge and authentic! ( ru kidiin' me?!? the owners are greeks from chicago!) plenty of tv's....nice patio for the smoker's music once a month with chuck e. baby and the all stars acoustic jam (2nd wed of the month). poker on wed, too.  dj on the weekend.nothing fancy about this place, but not a dive like some of the other sports bars in chandler : (like nate's 3rd base-- that place sucks!). the hob-nob is a great place for lunch , dinner, or just to hang out. be careful on bears game day! the place is packed!

1st time I've dealt with the guys at Greulich....very impressed. .There I was, picking up the kids at school in the mayhem known as the "drop off/ pick up zone", when all a sudden the wife's mini-van just died, blocking the way and bringing the organized chaos to a stand-still. Unable to get it re-started, I called triple A who said they'd send a tow-truck right away. I asked the operator at AAA if they would recommend a repair shop and they gave me the Greulich name.   Mini-van was towed in and after a phone call from their shop in Chandler, AZ (Germann/Alma School) I asked them to diagnose the trouble and give me a report. Their initial once over did not find the problem so they said they needed to further evaluate. After computer analysis, and inspection, it was determined that it was simply out of gas! Even though the gas guage read nearly 1/2 tank. They were honest enough  to let me know. when they could have easily replaced some high-dollar part, and I would not have known the difference.   I am thankful for their honesty and I would do business with them again.

Was treated fairly and they were honest and very reasonable on price...I recommend GREULICH....Went back to GREULICH with another vehicle.... for a "Road Trip" inspection and general maintenance, after nearly being taken advantage of by another competitor.(Joe's Auto--DON'T GO THERE. SEE REVIEW BELOW!). They guys at GREULICH were fast, friendly and fair.

1st OFF, I AM A RETURNING CUSTOMER AND I DO NOT WORK FOR GREULICH.... THE BAD REVIEWS MIGHT EVEN BE FROM THE COMPETITION.? THESE GUYS ARE AAA APPROVED!   My busy schedule has me running in 10 different directions and stopping for an oil change and "check-up" is the last thing on my mind or agenda. My "Time to Change Oil" indicator had been harassing me for a couple of weeks. I had a break in the action and so I stopped by Greulich on Alma in Chandler... They squeezed me in and had me on my way in less than 30 minutes. I am a happy camper. These guys always seem eager to help.

We USED to be RigaTony customers back in the day when they 1st opened their location at Az ave and Knox. Went there for years...until the neighborhood and  RigaTony's quality and service went WAY downhill. It was no big surprise when that location closed. We quit going altogether.  On a whim, (and hoping for the good old days when this place was one of our faves...) we tried their "new" location-- at Warner / McClintock-- I guess it has been there about a year+ so I figured that was enough time to get it together.Lucky us, Monday night is "Kids eat Free" night. With two toddlers in tow, this was a bonus! Not packed, but kind of busy for a Monday , we were greeted and seated right away. Our server was right on us and got our bev order. She also suggested that she could put the kids order in 1st, so they would not have to wait...great idea. The herb-bread with olive oil for dipping was even better than I remembered. And the antipasto salad included with the meal had generous portions of meat, cheese, tomatoes,onion, peppers, olives with house dressing, was fresh and very good. My wife who is allergic to onions, asked our sever to make her a salad without, and she was very accommodating... Not really sure what to try, I opted for the "Tour of Rigatony" plate which included a generous (more than a sample) portion of what I guess is their more popular items:Chicken Picatta, stuffed shells, fettucinni alfredo, and a huge italian sausage ( kind of spicy, to my delight!). This dish is for the hungry appetite...I brought half home; it's a lot of food for $14.95! The wife ordered the Capellini Seafood dish: Clams, mussels, shrimp sauteed in a very light white wine/butter and herb sauce, placed over angel hair pasta. She seemed to really enjoy it. I tasted it and the seafood was fresh and prepared very nicely. It also was a large serving.  We remembered that in the good old days, Rigatony's desserts were awesome, so we ordered the Tiramisou, and chocolate layered cake. These were truly scrumptious!   All in all, it was a wonderful dining experience.... service and food was great! Price was very reasonable for the amount of food...  The Mgr was making his rounds to each table making sure our evening was satisfactory....I related my story as a returning customer, and told him that they have won us back as regulars! The biggest compliment was from our 5 year old: "This is WAY better than Olive Garden! "

I've tried the place a few times-- for dinner and to see our favorite local entertainer... (Chuck E. Baby performs an all acoustic show there on Thursdays, and they have music on Fri and Sat, too)) So far so good! These new owners have improved the menu over the last....The food is very good.. The service was pretty decent for dinner-- but not so much on the beverage service. Had to go to the bar a couple of times to get a beer. They have a lot of beer choices on tap. It is a good neighborhood hang....
