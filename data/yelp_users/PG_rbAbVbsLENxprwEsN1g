Server (James) was great. Pointed us in the right direction and we had an amazing meal. Manager (Zach) made sure we were having a good experience and definitely made sure we'll come back!

I was the only guest with 5 employees working. Every table was dirty and the cashier didn't offer me my drink, I had to pull it out myself while he talked to the employee next to him. Sandwich was delicious as usual.
