I LOVE Faith Christian Center. Come as you are enviroment. Leave undertanding what the Pastor was talking about. I am not perfect and when I go i dont feel judged. Muticultral church, people of all ages attend. Thier mission is "Empowering you to be your Best." Its doesnt get any better than that.

I would never go there again. I walked it there and the guy looked at me like I was bothering him. I guess my money will bother him too.

I love this location. The only thing that I wish is that they used better lunch services and keep it consistant.

Food is what I expect from Yard house. But the hold time was way longer than conveyed. While waiting by the kitchen observed kitchen staff handle trash and then food without changing gloves.

Good but all the flavor is in the frosting.

Big portions full of flavor. Peach cobbler was not as impressive. Would go again for sure.

Food was amazing but the service was horrible! I would suggest to take out don't dine in. I ordered the eggs Benedict, instead of Canadian bacon, they put crispy bacon on it served it with hash browns and a salad with a balsamic vinegarette.   The two girl working there were so unprofessional from their interaction to the attire.

I ordered 2 wraps the gringo and the buffalo. They were both delicious but the buffalo had too much ranch. I would suggest place to anyone who like healthy, tasty food.

Used them for delivery and I was highly upset with the overall experience. Looked at their menu to order crab cakes and pork tenderloin. I get a call to advise me they are out of pork tenderloin. So I order their ribs. I asked if everything else is okay and they said yes but told me the ribs cost $3 more (they could of waived that). Then 5 minutes later I get a call stating they are out of crab cakes. Again 5 minutes ago I asked if everything else was okay.  First it took over an hour for my food to get delivered Then I get my ribs (not even what I originally wanted ) and I would say I was and am very underwhelmed. This will be my first and last time I would eat at Charr unless they can pull a rabbit out of their hat.
