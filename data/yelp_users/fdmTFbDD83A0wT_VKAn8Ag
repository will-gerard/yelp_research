Just got into the venue. The beer is a bit expensive ($12) but whatever it's normal for a venue like this. The seats I have are for section 204 club level which is nice because we have our own bar and a smoking patio. I just the sound here is as good as I remember it being. So for now a solid 4 stars.

First off let me state that if it were possible to give them less than a 1 star I would. I ordered the barbacoa enchiladas with refried beans. I had felt fine all day until this meal. The best thing here were their chips and salsa. The whole meal tasted rather bland. There was no difference in the seasoning at all on the plate. The margarita was decent at best. We only saw the server for orders and the check which by the was just a receipt they had no tray or book to present with it. as I was out on date night I didn't want my girlfriend to worry about how much the tab was.When other tables were checked on regularly in our area. Then when we left we saw a group of about 12 servers just hanging out by the door when we left. Needless to say I won't be back. I could have gone to filabertos spent less and received much better food and service. And to add to this horrible night when I get out of the car to go see a movie I feel nauseous and throw up in the parking lot not even 20 minuets after leaving. Then when I call to inform the manager he seem to accuse me of trying to receive a free meal. If your looking for a good fun dining experience do yourself a favor and go else where. Because I for one am never coming back here!!!!!

This place has potential but I felt lacked in several areas. I do have to say the staff was really professional and kind that is maybe the reason for the 2 stars. The sounds system and music were both really good. At the bar I ordered two mix drinks. The first tasted really weak. The second was really small and that included a shot of baileys that I did not ask for but yet was charged additionally. After these two drink I was still as sober as I was when I walked in the door. Which led me to the conclusion that they may be watering down their booze. Which makes me really sad. In all my days of bar hopping and clubbing across the globe I have never had such awful and watered down alcohol. This is upsetting that they even need to resort to this practice. I can honestly say their bartender need to learn to mix his cocktails better and learn how to pour the proper quantity into his drinks as well. I may never come back to this establishment again. However to end on a high note the security here was a true pleasure and respectful of the patrons from what I witnessed.

I have been here before and usually love the place the atmosphere and barbers are always a delight. however my visit this morning was somewhat troubling. i came in for a simple haircut and shave. my usual barber was not in attendance (Jack) whom is superb by the way. I was seen by lady by name Marina I believe. I asked for a haircut and shave usually $45. Ended up being $70. The additional charge for only some moisturizer and a face massage both things I did not ask for! And I was never warned there would be an additional charge. So to be blunt I'm a little bit upset. so whenever I comeback I will be sure to only see Jack! Shame on me for trying out a new barber today. That's $70 I didn't plan on spending before i go to a job interview. Very disappointing today services today that were in no way worth what I was charged! EDIT: I received a call from the owner yesterday was very sweet and eager to talk about the review. I did receive a message from one of the barbers and I feel this review needs to make a few things clear. 1.) The services I received were great. and marina is a fantastic barber. and the only discrepancy was that the additional charge of $25 was never previously discussed or brought up until check out. that was the really on disappointing shock. The whole point of this review was to reflect the lack of communication between barber and customer that's it. Mary was really understanding in that something may have gotten lost in translation. The goal of this review is not to try and be selfish and get free things from this establishment as i have been accused of. Mary (the owner) is fantastic and runs a great business and has superb barbers.

This restaurant is literally the biggest disappointment of my life!  Hardly even worth the one star I'm giving it! The soda tasted god awful. The boneless wings were really small. And it is really hard to fuck up a calzone! But guess what Uncle Sam found a way! It was burned and tasted gross plus they randomly put spinach in with the ricotta! Then when we brought it up to our waitress she just said "oh let me put it back in the oven for you". Which then made the worst calzone if my life exponentially worse it was dry and even more burned (almost black at this point)! The mozzarella sticks were cold and somehow the pizza sauce was steaming hot. Like somehow that makes up for the food being cold. And our service was awful there was like nobody in there so they were not even busy! So in conclusion all of our food was cold (mozzarella stick, boneless wings, and our shitty calzone) soda tasted gross and our waitress was useless! I would not recommend coming here you could go next door to Sonic pay half the price and get better food! If this place closes I would not even be shocked I don't know how this place is still open!

I hate to give this spot such a low review. I have been here many times before and the service is always spectacular. However on this trip I have to say the waitress was awful. She took her time getting to us bringing drinks to several different tables who had noticeable ordered after we had. I then let another member of the wait staff know that I would be back shortly to show my friend around the bar and give a nice historic tour. Our waitress then felt the need to come track me down to demand that I pay my tab. At this point I had enough of her rude behavior and just paid and left! I can honestly say I have never received such terrible service before. And from such a nice upscale bar none the less. I love this place but I must say it will be a while before I even want to think about coming back here. I am very extremely disappointed in Hanny's tonight!

The service was awful we had to argue with the waitress to even split the check. everything is hella overpriced compared to how it is priced in the menu. This is exactly why I don't come to saddle ranch anymore. why pay outrageous prices for crap beer when I can pay the same amount and the beer is of much higher quality and more unique selection in downtown Glendale (OTG or Hause Murphy) or in downtown Phoenix (Angels Trumpet). At least at those establishments they are grateful for you spending your money at those bars.

Slow making subs and service was far from perfect. The bread seemed to sitting out for quite some time so the bread was hard. As well as the music was way too loud I felt like I had to almost shout to be heard to place the order. Even then the order was made incorrectly.  When I kindly approached the guy at the register he seemed to have an attitude.  I am a big fan of Jimmy John's. However this location has a lot to work on in the area of customer service.  It will be awhile before I'm back at this location.

The beer selection is always nothing short of amazing. And staff is friendly and well educated on the beer and wine on tap. The food here is delicious as well and a bit unique with its taste most notably with the Casper flat bread. But its stellar none the less. Out of the countless times I have been here I have never had a bad experience. Except maybe a wait for a seat at the bar which is okay the beer is more than worth the wait!

Great bartenders! However I find the drink to be very over priced and security was a tad bit less than professional to say the least! If I ever come back it will be because of The friends that work there and the decent live music!

Bartenders were slow to us and to make drinks. The bartenders seemed to be lacking basic fundamental skills of being a bartender. The overall service here was less than desirable. Needless to say the drinks were over priced. But then again this is westgate. Overall the customer service was atrocious and the staff was less than friendly. If you are looking for a good place to drink I highly suggest you look elsewhere.

location is not too bad. in my experience Cane's has always had spectacular customer service. and the food seems to always be made in a timely manner. furthermore the Cane's sauce is to die for. The only critique may be is that I expected the dining room to be a bit bigger considering its in a very high volume populated area. other that this by far one of the best chains out there.
