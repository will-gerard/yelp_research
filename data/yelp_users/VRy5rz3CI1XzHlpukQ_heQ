These guys consistently do a really good job, the sushi is not too expensive and always good quality. It seems that there are less sushi restaurants that actually have staff who are familiar with the traditional sushi options and not just all americanized rolls. I really like a good chirashi bowl and the sushi chef at sakana does a fantastic job with their bowls. I love their Happy Hour if you order a bomber size beer you get to choose one of a variety of apps for .99 which is a great addition to the already good sushi and value. It always seems like the best sushi spots are always tucked away in a shopping plaza that doesn't get much activity like the one that sakana is in on Indian bend.

It is well worth the drive for me from Central Phoenix to Arizona Mills for this little gem in Tempe what I spend it gas I make up in dividends in savings. I have gotten three pairs of my favorite designer jeans there now at literally 1/3 of the normal price and I didn't have to fight off an orc to get them. As a matter of fact the day that I went was like I had the run of the store and I was shopping alone. For all the many bad experiences that I have had in shopping in outlet stores Sak's made up for it with a wonderful shopping experience and great value.

Just bought a cruiser so I can run the roads and I hit a few bike shops before I made my decision. These guys are priced as good or better than anywhere else that I tried, and the team there was super nice and helpful. I think that the guy who owns it also works there, whether he was or not the guys were super friendly and very well informed. Cars, bikes, and electronics are something that I need the guy who is selling it to me to know much more about than me and not make me feel like he is using his knowledge to sell me more than I need and that was the feeling I got from these guys.

I can't think of a better place to enjoy a glass of wine and an amazing antipasto or calzone. This place has probably one of the best patios in Phoenix and the coolest part is that it is an old historical district house that was transformed into a mom and pop style italian kitchen. I have tried quite a few things on their menu from the burrata and proscuitto to multiple different pizzas and they have managed to walk away unscathed and for that, the patio, the service, and ambiance I think they deserve 5 stars.

These guys do a great job I have always had a good experience with my puppies here. I wish I could be more specific, but the staff is very friendly my puppies are always comfortable when I drop them off here and they do a good job with the grooming, washing, nail clipping, etc. So kudos Smelly dog

The overwhelming since of being in a movie came over me as I wandered into last chance...A horror movie or maybe more like MAD MAX where there is no gasoline left and these crazy blood thirsty savages are driving around cars with peoples heads and body parts mounted to the frames. Except instead of gasoline it was labels and name brands  and instead cars it was shopping carts and instead of blood thirsty savages it was...oh that was the same! Holy Cow! I can appreciate a good deal as much as the next person, but there is an overwhelming since of potential physical violence as you watch the attendants try and hold back the mobs while they reload the clothing racks. It really should be some sort of social experiment about the effects of materialism. Im not normally a two star kind of girl, but this visit left me scarred.

Where oh where are you Lucky Strike? This is a very difficult place to find from the get go, so if you are on your way make sure you KNOW where you are going before you get there. I am giving these guys 5 stars because I love to bowl and this place takes bowling to another level it is does not make me want to finish the phrase bowling with "alley"...Maybe bowling "avenue" :). A group of my friends went to the New Times 'Brews for Benefits" and decided to stay for bowling. Think ultra lounge with the option to bowl. We shared some belgium fries and sliders and it definitely wasn't typical bowling alley fare. The service was great and the manager even came by and gave us all free game cards. If you are looking for a really good way to spend a Friday night these guys do a great job.  One note on the location--It is in the Southwest corner on the second floor on the corner of Jefferson and 1st Avenue.

Me and a couple of my friends did dinner here the other night and Im really glad we did, its great to see so many new and well run venues in the downtown area. We were on our way to a Suns game and decided to stop in for a bite.  I decided to do some "carb loading" and had the soft pretzels and provolone fondue and they were awesome the pretzels were nice and soft and the cheese was a perfect companion,  followed by the chicken stroganoff which was very nicely done and the sauce was just the right consistency not too thick and not too soupy. The service was very good and the downtown vibe is actually starting to feel like it is getting a pulse.

Had I known that eating vegan could be this delicious I would have stopped eating meat a long time ago. I had the Curry "Chicken" with veggies and it was absolutely delicious. Simple set up, quaint and unassuming Green New American is a breath of fresh air to the idea of eating vegetarian or vegan. I hope to see more restaurants like this turn up in the Phoenix area, where the possibilities of eating vegetarian is not so inconvenient.

You would think that the idea of "fast food" sushi would send you running for the hills, but that is certainly not the case with this concept. It is clean, simple, and the quality is consistent. The only reason for four stars is that a very large portion of going out for sushi is the experience and trying new things. How do you roll is just for getting your fix without all the fluff and stuff. If you want to try something different for lunch and you are in a hurry you can be in and out of here in 15 minutes (that is including time to nosh). Definitely out of the ordinary and definitely worth a try.

Had breakfast here the other Sunday morning and the food was amazing. Great flavors and a fantastic variety for carnivores. If you are in the mood for some comfort food and have a few calories to spare this place is great. We also had a little breakfast/dessert the banana bread french toast was really good. It was a little small and the coffee bar set up is kinda weird even still amongst all the good places to have breakfast these guys still stand out.

I wish there was a 2.5 rating on here. Let me start with the positive our server was super awesome and knowledgeable about beer as well as really friendly. If I were to rate the place strictly on the service it would be an easy 5 star review, however there were some things that just didn't measure up.    We found a table outside and the weather was perfect, so that was a plus. We proceeded to order a "flight" of beer. Which was 6 different samples of selections from the 25 plus handles that are rotated frequently (I think daily, but I could be wrong on that). Here is the first part of the reason for the 2 stars. There are 2 boards to read the selection of draughts that are being featured, and a menu that describes what each of the types of beers are for example  A "Lager" is..... or A "Stout" is..... However there is no correlation that I could decipher that would tell you what "type" of beer that the featured name stood for, so let's say number 22 on the board was Witte...If you are a beer rookie there was no way to know what type it was. This causes one of at least two dilemmas, you can either 1. ask the server what type of beer each of the 25 or so types are (which...."Ain't nobody got time for that" :)  or you can play a little "Russian Beerlette" and just hope for the best, at any rate there are some specific types of beer that I just do not enjoy, and I didn't want the server to have to reel off all of the specifics of each beers that was on the board. I love the idea of the constantly rotating types of draught, but they need to figure out a better delivery system for the patron. The other part of the review was based on the appetizers that we had, one of which was the pretzels. Maybe I am americanized and have been spoiled to food a certain way, but I like my pretzels soft all the way through and really doughy (if that's a word) and theirs just weren't that. The pretzels were not very moist and the selection of cheese and mustard was ok at best. I really hate giving two stars, but I gotta be honest about my experience.  Great concept, great server, poor execution....I might try again in a few months and see if they changed anything.
