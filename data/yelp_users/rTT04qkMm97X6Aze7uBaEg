I have been to the Scottsdale Ruth's Chris several times for happy hour on the patio.  The view is amazing.  The problem is the service!  Last week my friend and I sat on the patio for 20 minutes as the wait staff walked around, ignoring us.  When we finally ordered our drinks (which we had picked from the website happy hour menu) we were told that those were not on the happy hour menu...the waitress had no intention of honoring the website list, nor discussing it.    When our food came, my sliders were very dry...I waited for the waitress to come back around, so I could ask for mustard.  I waited...and waited...and waited....   Finally, I got up and asked the hostess to please get me some mustard.  Through the evening, I ended up asking the hostess for mustard, more water, and the bill because our waitress was missing in action.  We didn't decide to go to a local haunt for a drink, nor did we decide to go to a mega-chain restaurant.....we chose the upscale spot, payed the upscale prices and expected an upscale experience, which we did not get!!!

This place is a fun experience.  To be clear, you don't go there for the food....you go for the experience.  The view is outstanding.  We've been going every year or two for many years to see the entire central city, sunsets, incoming airplanes, and lightning storms in the distance.  We watched both gigantic sports stadiums being built below us and have even caught a local haboob (giant dust storm)  boiling up from the south.  Little kids could go if they are really well-behaved (it's a quiet setting), and teens will think it's cool.  Grandparents and great-grandparents love it!  While slightly spendy, this experience is fun for all ages.  Life is short....find the silver linings....the Compass Room is a fun restaurant!!

I recently had major surgery at Piper and stayed overnight upstairs in their 9-bed facility.  At every step I was treated with kindness and compassion.  The medical care I received was amazing.  My overnight stay, upstairs, was quiet and stress-free, unlike a normal hospital stay.  I am amazed by this facility.  From the first minute to the last, my family and I were extremely satisfied.

We eat at both the Tatum and Shea location and the Scottsdale Fasion Square location.  The service is always friendly and the food is always very good.  It is a staple restaurant for just our family and when we are entertaining guests from out of town.  My husband and I also try to have a drink on the patio at least once a month.  Happy Hour is very good.  You won't be disappointed in this restaurant!

Jenn Dew is my hair angel!  For years, Jenn has helped me maintain my professional image, while staying fun and current.  She has her finger on the pulse of style, and is expertly able to manipulate that style to fit the needs of every client.  While keeping this forty-something looking simple, fresh and professional, and she keeps my teenage son looking contemporary and cool....all with that sweet smile on her face.  When you go, ask her about her education...she has trained with the best and brightest in the industry!

We just celebrated a birthday on the patio at the Indian Bend and Scottsdale Road location.  Our service was fantastic and the Happy Hour prices were very good.  I recommend the location to anyone who wants a casual drink and snack!

Daily Dose serves a bigggg cup of coffee at breakfast, and I love that!  Another thing that really impresses me is that the booths have very high backs, so if you are having a business meeting or a private conversation with a friend, your voices and faces are blocked from most other customers.  The food is good and the menu is varied...healthy choices and the regulars, too.  The service isn't great, but it's very manageable.  The location is great for people who are meeting someone because it is right off the 51 freeway at Camelback.  Give this one a try.  You'll like it.
