The staff is very friendly and helpful. I didn't like the sugar free vanilla latte so they made me a chocolate one instead no questions  asked. The green tea is a little harsh for my taste, but the atmosphere is very laid back and more open than Starbucks.

Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service. Was yelled at, laughed at, an my questions were brushed away. Plus I bought a sweatshirt and it smelled bad out of the store so I went to return it the next day. They then told me they wouldn't swap it out because it smelled weird.. I was outraged and the "manager", a girl named Taylor, was extremely rude and did not handle the situation like a professional would. I don't know why they allow 16 year olds with no customer service skills whatsoever to become manager. I will NEVER shop at Zumiez again because of this experience.

Food is great, service is terrible. I ordered my little brother spaghetti and meatballs, and it came out with no meatballs. When the waitress came back, she bluntly asked me, "what's wrong with it?" And then told me it didn't come with meatballs, even though it clearly said it did on the menu.  Another issue was that my girlfriends salad came out with the wrong dressing, and they took at least fifteen minutes to bring her out a new one.  So after we enjoyed our meal, I get the check and the supposed comped salad was actually charged twice on the receipt. When asking the manager about it, he argued with me and finally, very rudely, fixed the order.   I will not be going back there, which is unfortunate because the Penne in Vodka Sauce is delicious.

I just left this place with my girlfriend and we are unsatisfied and astonished to say the least. I have no idea why this restaurant is even still open.   Setting:   The only other customers in the store were at the bar. The lighting inside was dingy, dark, and there was a strange general odor about the entire place.   Experience:  We were seated immediately and the tip hungry waitress was there instantly. I had high hopes initially but they were quickly shot down. Upon looking at the prices, I thought the designer had made a mistake. Simple and over priced entrees riddled the menu, after ordering our water (which had a very strong chlorine taste) we ordered our food.  My girlfriend ordered the steak salad, with no tomatoes, and I ordered the spicy chicken fettuccine. When we got the food I was amazed at how small the portions were, about 5 ounces of pasta, and the smallest chicken breast I've even seen. My girlfriends salad came out with tomatoes on it. The waitress came up to check on us after a few minutes and when we told her there was tomatoes on the salad she just blamed the kitchen staff and walked away. When she came back later she offered to send it back but at this point we wanted to eat and leave.   After waiting while our waitress sat and talked to the bartender for ten minutes, we got the check and to my amazement, no comp, no apology, no anything for the faulty order! And what gets me is that the entire time the MANAGER sat next to us on a laptop, and I know she had to have heard everything.   In conclusion, if you want to be disappointed and over pay for half assed tiny portioned food, then this is the place for you!   My suggestion would to get management that knows how to do their job properly, and I can only hope that Barrel Grill is soon replaced with a restaurant that knows how to treat their customers.
