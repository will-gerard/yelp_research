HORRIBLE! I called in my prescription 3 hours ago and they said it would be ready in 30 minutes. I called to check on the status on my way there...7 minutes later I'm still in hold and already in the door and at the pharmacy counter to find that I have to wait another 15 minutes for the not so polite tall grey haired man to fill it. I'm tired and the whole reason to call it in is so I don't have to wait!
