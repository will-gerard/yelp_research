This location brings ineptness and mediocrity to new levels. There is an issue ever time a script is filled. My most recent experience was with an antibiotic script. My doctor faxed it an hour earlier; I stopped in on my way home to see if it was ready. They claimed they never received it. I called my doctor and they had confirmation that it had been received at this location an hour earlier but offered to resend it to them, which they did. As I'm leaving, the pharmacy calls my name stating my medication is ready to be picked up. I pay and head home. When I get home, the pharmacy calls me to tell me there is a delay because they don't have the medication in stock. Today, seven days later, as I'm taking my last dose, they call to tell me my script is now ready for pick up. I presume they've filled the script that was resent to them. I'm curious as to why they didn't see that he had already been filled on the day it was received as this is a strong antibiotic and shouldn't be taken for two rounds in a row. Needless to say, this is the last time I fill a script with Walgreens and I won't we shopping for any overpriced items at this location.

I love the food here. The cheese ravioli is so incredibly creamy and the vodka sauce is on point. Pizza is always delicious and the staff is friendly.

I tried this salon based on the yelp reviews and I'm so glad that I did! Danielle gave me a fantastic haircut and fixed my layers. Can't wait to see her again!

Danielle is fantastic. She's been cutting my hair since last Autumn and I had long hair.she would mostly trim and shape it up. I went in this past weekend and cut it all off (middle of my back in length). It is now super short and looks AMAZING! I showed her one picture of what I was thinking of and she adapted it to work withy face shape and hair type. Love her!

Unique dishes and such amazing food. The place doesn't look like much at first glance but we've never been disappointed with the food or service. The only thing I'd change is the way they have you order, for a first timer the order slip can be confusing (friends recently came home with a dozen cookies they didn't mean to order, not that I'm complaining, yum!).

I love this place. Delicious fish and chips, shepard's pie just like I had in Ireland and fantastic Guinness which is poured properly. I love this place do much I tat my bridal shower was held here. They were so fantastic about it and all my friends love the experience. They were so great about handling our large group.

This is our favorite! The service has always been incredible and everything on the menu is great. We love the tikka masala and the dal. Great naan and samosas. Can't wait to go again.

I really enjoyed the raspberry chocolate macaron. I'm so happy that there is a place in the area that makes this wonderful pastry in the valley and does it well. We also purchased the red velvet and chocolate cupcakes. Those were pretty good. I will return to have lunch and another macaron.

I thought I'd give this place another try. That was a mistake. They still can't pour a proper pint of Guinness (how hard can this be, the instructions are on the Guinness website). I had to send the pint back twice and finally gave up on the third one. The food was flavorless and cold. One person in my party had a soggy cold burger that appearred to me microwaved.  On a Saturday night, this place was empty. I don't understand with the reviews on here and the lack of business on the night most people go out to eat, how they are still open.   I rated this with one star because our service was incredibly nice (and apologetic when she realized none of us ate our meals or drank the Guinness and cut the price of our bill in half). I feel bad for the wait staff.

We had to have our patio roof replaced. These guys did excellent work, quick turn around, great price quote and very professional. We are very please with the work completed and will be using them in the future!

We requested to schedule an estimate for a repair via their contact the he of their website in mid-November, based in a referral from a friend. We didn't get a response for well over a week. When we did get a response it was by e-mail asking if we we're still interested in an estimate and if so to respond to the e-mail. We responded that we still needed an estimate. After waiting a week for response we called and were told that some one would call us the following Tuesday or Wednesday to come out and look at the roof, but never heard from anyone. We called this past Monday and left another message asking for Richard who does the estimate to call us back and received a call asking if anyone ever reached out to us. We still haven't heard from anyone to schedule and complete the estimate. It's been a month since we originally requested the estimate. If this is the response when a new customer is interested in hiring a business, we'll look elsewhere.

Wonderful, light treat after dinner at one of the local restaurants. My favorite flavors are the rice pudding flavor, peach mint and the pecan. My dog loved the chicken flavored paleta.

Went here with friends on a Saturday night. Reservations recommended. It was very busy.   The food was good. Large portions and properly seasoned. We had the lamb kabobs, spanakopita, spicy feta dip, hummus and tzatziki. Great wine selection.   Decor is typical Athenian design and there are a few "cheesy" elements (appetizer that is flambeed in front of your table with the server yelling, "OPA!" as it lights and a belly dancer).   Overall a decent experience.

We went here for my birthday dinner. We started with the pulled pork on corn cakes. Delicious! My husband had the smoked salmon pizza and I have the macaroni and cheese. The pizza was wonderful, the mac and cheese needed a pit more seasoning, but was creamy and satisfying nonetheless. We had the sticky toffee cake for dessert. I bake, so I have high standards for dessert. This was a little lackluster. I'd skip dessert next time.   Overall, a pleasant experience, good service, nice atmosphere and a great wine selection.

Fantastic! They were punctual and amazingly kind and friendly. They took great care with our belongings and were reasonably priced. I've never had a move go so smoothly!

I love a good American interpretation of an Irish pub/bar. This is not a good interpretation. The interior didn't have any characteristics that were memorable. The menu offers the typical fare. We tried the pretzel sticks with Irish beer cheese. The cheese was gelatinous an tasted like Easy Cheese. For dinner we ordered Shepard's Pie and fish and chips. The Shepard's Pie was topped with what tasted like boxed mashed potatoes; the ground beef and vegetables were black and greasy. We were unable to eat the dish. The fish and chips were awful. You should be able to cut the fish easily with a fork, we had to use a knife. The chips weren't cooked all the way. The service was slow and the tables weren't cleaned promptly. We required a high chair and the one that was brought to use was filthy. I had to wipe it clean myself. We won't be returning and I can not recommend this place to anyone.
