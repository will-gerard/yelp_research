My dad and I came here for a 10:40 tee time after getting frozed out at The Boulders on New Years Day.   Almost everybody was a walker here. Besides us i think we saw 2-3 other golf carts. My dad has been playing for 20 years and me 2 1/2 and we have never seen so many walkers at a course. It was 40 degrees and below the whole day. Lucky for us i have Hot Hands in my bag.  This is strictly a golfers course. There are no gimmicks here. There really is no signature hole but it is a great course for golfers and its long. We didnt play from the tips, but they are over 7300 yards.   First time playing on Bermuda type green also. I liked them alot and wish more courses used it.

I lived in Phx for my 1st 18yrs and I had never been here!!  I brought my family with me and my aunt and grandma and my grandma had never been here and she usually knows about all these places.  Very cool place.  I got the El Pollo Fundido and the prickly pear margarita.  the margarita didn't have much flavor difference then a regular one so I would try a different drink next time. The fundido was great and I couldn't get enough of the sauce. The flour chips are really different and good also.  Will be back!

I haven't been here in almost 30 years when I was a kid. I remember how fun it was coming here all the time and playing in the grass on the left side.  They haven't made a change here since they first built this place, its so out dated its not funny. its falling apart.   The track looks great but the building itself is complete garbage.

My wife and I see these commercials all the time and we dont even have any in Cali that we know of. So we had to try it today. There is alot of great sounding dishes on the menu. I didnt know what to get and im a sucker for memphis dry rub ribs. They where ok. I usually like to try places signature dishes but i couldnt pass it up. They have alot of different flavor lemonades and ice tees also. We tried a few.

6 months ago my grandma had us goto coco's. yuk. So when we came to visit again i told my wife anything but coco's dennys etc... It was funny because we where suggesting chilis and black angus and she would bring up coco' each time. but i told my wife i am done with those type of places. So we got to goto chili's :-) i ordered the memphis dry rub ribs. Ive had them before and i love the flavor. The ribs where kind of dry and i had to rip the meat off the bone. It wasnt as dry as famous daves though. The ribs i got near home at chilis are a 5 but i can only give this one a 4.

This is for Saguaro course. Golfweek says this is the #1 public course in Arizona so when i came down for Thanksgiving i had to check it out. We got there with plenty of time to warm up and hit some balls on the range. The range balls and the range itself was great. There are a few really long par 4's but they counter back with a few really short ones. There was a par 5 around 600yds. There was nothing to complain about. We where the 2nd group out and it was cart path only and we finished in 4 hours.

Back in Arizona to help my grandma and Aunt move and they moved 1 mile from here. So 14 of us went here today and there was no complaints. Everybody liked it, my cousin said the french fries are the best. I ordered a pork and slaw sandwich. I would definitly order it again. My wife told the lady easy on the slaw and she got extra slaw, that was pretty funny. I was half way thru my sandwich and i traded with her. My sandwich didnt have as much slaw and i liked that one alot better. I also got the potato salad and it was ok, ill get the fries next time. I wanta try some of this stuff next time also catfish, bbq turkey andpork sundae

read all the reviews of local hotels and this by far was the best. Check-in was great, great service. I booked 3 nights but only needed to stay one after deciding to stay with family after the 1st night. no problems, no cancel fee.  the room was clean and they made sure it had extra towels and pillows like we asked.  great service

I really wanted to like this place hearing that they are from Italy. but i really dont have much to say about it. I had a regular cheese pizza and my best way to explain it would be it seemed watered down or watery if that makes since. I also didnt care for the cheesebread :-(

Played in a 2 day tournament last weekend, on the Lexington course. Went to hit balls on the range and there was no balls!! they said the guy didnt show up. 1/2 later they had somebody out there. besides that the service was good. The course has a lot of great holes but the greens where alittle beat up. The speed was great on the first day and slowed a bit on the 2nd day but still not bad. There is way to many cart path only holes. So many that it was stupid, cartpath only slows a round down alot and it did for us and was very slow.

Took my dad and brother here and they couldn't believe what it was when we showed up. right in the middle of a neighborhood and outside grill.  We got some brisket sandwiches and mac n cheese. Got a lot of meat with the sandwich and it was cooked perfect and tasted great. the mac n cheese was one of my favorites of all time.  cant wait to comeback

We golfed here about 2pm on a Friday and had the course to ourselves. Of course there a lot of cool holes. My only complaint about the course is that a lot of the bunkers are hard packed sand and not well taken care of.  The greens had been punched recently and wasn't told this when I booked my tee time. Would really like to comeback and play when the greens are not punched.

Wanted to goto a Waffle House since we dont have any around us in california.  We chose this one because it was in North Phoenix and hoping it was a little nicer then some of the others we drove by. It didnt matter, i guess a waffle house is a waffle house. They had some teenager cooking the food and we where wondering how the food was going to come out, well the bacon was black and burnt, atleast the waitress asked us before we said anything about it. So she got us some more bacon and this time it was just under cooked. The egg's were not cooked all the way. The waffles where good and the hash browns where good if you didnt eat the burnt parts. Might try it again but maybe a different location

We had are choice between this Lennys or the one off of 59th.  We chose this one because we get a $1 off each combo. Later in the day we just happened to drive by the one on 59th and wished we went there instead.  We walked up and there was a big cloud coming out the , i thought it was a water mister but it was the smoke coming from the grill. It was crazy, we walked in and you couldnt see 2 feet in front of you.  We all order burgers of course and some fries. There was no complaints and we would go back. My aunt came with us and she use to live a few miles from here, years ago and she said she use to come here every once in awhile. Im guessing 20+ years.  They have a small room to eat in next door.

Ordered the brisket, wife pulled pork. The brisket was very good and the sauce was even better.  the curley fries were better then the regular. The potato salad was probably one of the worse ive had. didnt have any flavor and i couldnt eat it. I ordered a Chicago dog and the toppings were top notch but the hot dog itself was bad, dont know if it had been sitting around all day or what.

playing in a 2 day tourney and the staff was great and so was the course. The Raptor course is a little tighter then the Talon. Talon has some tougher greens though. so pick your poison if you cant deciede on what course to play.  17th on raptor has an island green.  both are great courses

Came here for breakfast with my dad. Place doesnt open until 8am.  I ordered the chicken fried steak with biscuits and gravy and some OJ and it came with some potatoes. I dont remember what my dad got but  both our plates tasted like a jar of oregano. It was like they spilled it all over our dishes and instead of remaking more, they said fuck it and gave it to us.  I think it actually would have been good if it wasnt for the oregano all over.

I was in town for a 2 day golf tourney ( i Won!!)and  i had to try a good place out. I took my parents and aunt here and we split an original stromboli and a meatball stromboli. Meatball is my favorite and i dont really care for the cold cut strombolis but this cold cut or orginal sromboli was great but of course i thought the meatball was better. I could eat that everyday. Great service. Dont let the outside of the building fool you or the people you bring. just tell them to trust you. I will go back everytime im in Vegas.

wont stay here again.  we reserved a king bed non smoking and when we show up they dont have any, but they looked alitte harder in there computer and found one. We get to our room and right when you open the door it smells like nasty cigarettes. we called to complain right away to get us another room and there was nothing they could do but send up house keeping to spray the room which didnt help that much. we left the window opened all weekend and the fan on. and like someobody else said, it is a boring hotel compared to others.

My dad and I came here after a round at Papago. Yes I came here because it was on DDD.  They lady behind the counter was super cool and gave us a bunch of samples before we ordered. My dad wanted the macheca before the sample and wanted it even more after. He said that this was the best place ive picked. Its not the best but it was really good.  I ordered the jade red chicken in a quesidalla and the jerk chicken in a burrito and i also got the refried beans. I really liked the jade red chicken and i would order that every time. I wouldnt order the jerk chicken again. It also came with a cookie that is like a churro in cookie form and it was great also.

back in town for spring training and we had to go back. Alot of the time when you go back somewhere its never as good as the first time but not here. I ordred the brisket and its the best. The dont hide the meat with a gallon of sauce. they actually dont give you enough sauce. They dont need to because the meat is that good but most sauces are bad and you would actually want them to drence the meat with there sauce. Its hard to find great meat with great sauce. The mac n cheese was the best. good bread. I cant wait to go back to Phx to see family of course :-) This is also the place to be. came on a friday night and it took forever to get a table but the club/bar was jam packed.

We came here earlier in the day and it was packed so we left. We came back later for dinner, around 6:00 and we got right in.  We split the sage fried chicken benedict and it was huge. I would definitly order it again, biscuits, eggs, gravy, mash potatoes and whatever else they throw in there.  I saw plenty of other dishes that the servers where passing out and i want to try those, like the chicken and waffles

My wife and I got a chance to come here on a saturday night.  We sat on the patio and there was 2 guys playing music. Pretty loud.  We ordered a big azz pretzel that was great and my wife couldnt stop talking about it for days afterwards. It was the best pretzel ever.  They do take there time bringing out the food and getting the check, so plan on being there for awhile.   We ordered a schnitzel, the swiss style one. Its kind of like a corden on bleu but with pork and it has some very suttle flavors, nothing over powers anything.  We would definitly go back and if you do go, make sure you get a pretzel

came  here for dinner with the family. We ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza with some wings and cheesy bread. The bread was $4.25  and was two small pieces of bread. it was good but where is my $4.25 worth of cheesy bread. The pizza was pretty good and everybody liked it but bring your own sponge to soak up the grease. crazy amount. Nobody cared for the wings, i think it was more of the quality of them then the flavor. I liked the flavor. Id go back and order another pizza for sure.

came here after playing tpc scottsdale. My dad got a chicken sandwich and loved it. We had the az. egg rolls, ive had  these before somewhere but dont remember where. I ordered the wcg cheeseburger and it was great. I tried finishing it but ate to many egg rolls and way to many glasses of fresh squezzed lemonade that was great also. I kept trying to finish the burger because it was so good but just couldnt and i still had to leave room for the white chocolate bannana cream pie. that was great to but i only wish it had more white chocolate.

we usually try to find some different places while we are on vacation. We where not sure what to expect. i had a feeling we shouldnt come here because all the good reviews where for breakfast but who can screw up a breakfast menu? I ordered the ribs with tri-tip and mac n cheese as a side. the mac n cheese wasnt even close to being good. i give that a 1. I found out later that night that my cousin didnt like it either. On there menu it says the ribs are the most ordered thing. The first rib was a 4.5 but then all the meat disappered because there wasnt much. To of the ribs where broke also, not something you want to see while eating. The tri-tip was ok also the parts you could eat anyways. The garlic bread isnt garlic bread that i give a 1 also. My grandma ordered spaghetti and meat balls and she had to use my steak knife to cut one of her meatballs lol.  never coming back

Came here with family for brunch, around 1030-11. was hoping to get the pig dip sandwich but they said it was too early.  I settled on the pancake griddle.  the presentation of it was just a pancake on a plate and small. not impressive. but it was very heavy and soaked in syrup and was very good. I like sweet and it was.   I will comeback for lunch or dinner to get the pig dip sandwich.

This is the worst casino hotel ive ever stayed at in Vegas. I would never stay here again. Its for trash. Its not close to the strip  which didnt matter to me cuz i didnt ever go there anyways. One of the towels i used stunk like  fish water. The next night you could here the people next door and it also sounded like people stomping and jumping above. I was on the 17th floor. had used shampoo etc in the bathroom.  Never again!

does Vegas have the worst cusotmer service or what, when it comes to hotels. We requested 2 rooms to be joined together 3-4 months in advance. We get there and they are not even close to each other. We complain and it doenst get us anywhere, they just didnt care. While we where complaing at the counter the guy next to us is yelling at the other lady because he had reserved a room and they said they didnt show it and he said he isnt going anywhere until they get him a room, WTF. I really like the rooms, its bad that service is so bad. When we goto hotels we always put the DND sign on the door because we dont want people in our room when we are not there, well there wasnt a sign and we requested that they bring us one and to just put in in the door. We get back and our room is cleaned up etc and no sign on the door. horrible.

i really dont like this stadium. its the worst stadium ive been to and ive been to about 10. It has that cookie-cutter feel to it and the outside of the stadium looks like a large buiding, not like your going to a ball game. the bleachers are by far the most uncomfortable. where your ass goes its shaped weird so you cant sit up straight, you have to actually slouch to be alitte bit comfortable and you have not elbow room at all.

I would order it again. also ordered a watermelon fresca that was really good also.  the sandwich came with potato chips which we all thought was weird because we were at a Mexican restaurant but it was a sandwich i guess but still would rather had tortilla chips.

Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in.   About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me.  My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready.  There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes. Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast

Its not as cool as the other locations ive been to. I ordered the chicken and ribs. The chicken was so good! The ribs where dry and didnt care for them but i could have ate plenty of more chicken. The lil old lady that helped us was very nice also

It was definilty a 5star pizza. My wife and aunt both ordered the Italiano sandwich and it was to spicy for both of them. I ate  alittle bit of it. It did have a kick but it was pretty good also. I would definitly come back here for the pizza.

We can on the 1st free Friday of the month day.  This is just a huge in door play ground for kids.  My daughter is 10 and she had some fun but not as much as younger kids would have. not really what I expected and if you come on the free day expect to wait if you don't get there early, luckily we did and didn't have to wait at all and there is 1000 of kids everywhere. so if you want your kid to enjoy it don't come on the free day

Met a friend here for breakfast while i was in town. there is a ton of great things on this menu but i wasnt really prepared when it was time to order and threw out pigs and a blanket. Not what i really wanted but i was good and service was great.  I would eat the pigs in a blanket again but wouldnt order it again because there is to many good things on this menu.

Its a nice hotel with great service but our room was right over the freeway and it was loud all night. There windows are thin and it might as well be open all night. The helicopter that flew over for an hour didnt help either.  If we go back, i will not get a room by the freeway. Didnt get to sleep at all. The breakfast wasnt bad for a continental.

Yelp couldnt help me with this one, it does work right sometimes on my phone and couldnt see what was good in cave creek so we  came here, we  probably could have picked anything else and would have been better. Ive wrote about some bad bbq sauces before but this might be the worst and the bbq beef itself was nasty.  I think it was old meat. Also ordered cheese crisp and believe it or not it was too crispy !! no way i would ever go back. If you decide to go dont get anything bbq

On vacation for a golf tourney and this was near the course.  I got the waffle dogs and they didn't bring me the syrup. I took a bite and was very dry so I asked if I was suppose to get syrup, yup!  The syrup is what makes it so good, their was something in the waffle dog that I didn't care for (sage?) not sure exactly what it was but still very good.  and the strawberry lemon aid you have to get.

I couldnt wait to get back to a Smashburger after having my first one in Vegas. I got the Sincity burger in Vegas and they dont offer anything like this that i saw here. :-( So i deceided to get the Arizona burger and it was ok, if it was my first smashburger i wouldnt be craving it though like i did with the sincity burger. So now i still have to wait for that crave.

I ordered 1 pork and 1 beef taco. Both where really good. I liked the beef one alot better. I could have ate 3-4 more  of those. They have 3 different ice teas and i had the green tea , my 4yr old even liked it. My wife and daughter split a quesadilla and i had a piece. I would order it all again.

first off panda express isn't my favorite but my wife and daughter love it. so we stopped here on our way home from Phoenix and they screwed up the order. everytime I would say something she would ask what I said, never had this happen, don't know if she was half deaf or something else, even after I had to repeat everything she still screwed it up and I wasn't about to turn around on the 10fwy on my way to cali.

We went to the hash house a gogo and it was packed and we only had half hour to eat.  So on our way to Bears Best we ran into this place and we both were happy we did.  I ordered the Sin City burger without grilled onions and it was the best burger ive had in a long time. Its not a plain round burger.  The burger has some much flavor and herbs and spices in it that you cant appreciate the fries. I couldnt taste any flavor from the fries because of the burger.  Now open one up in Southern California!!

I saw this place in/near San Diego and didn't get a chance to go and while on vacation I saw it here, didn't realize it was a franchise.   I ordered 2 different bundts and both where great even the next day. I  would definitely buy some more.

Ive always been afraid to come here because of the wait. I finally said screw it since we didn't have any plans so we might as well wait.  I ordered the pancakes with a side of bacon and my wife and daughter shared some eggs with hashbrowns and my picky grandma got a cheese omelette.   The pancakes are great but just like any other breakfast place you never get enough butter and syrup. The bacon was the BEST ever and everybody really liked the hasbrowns. you could go eat just the bacon and be happy and leave oh and they strawberry lemonade was really good also. would love to come back.

I ordered the devil dog and the green chili cheese fries.  The fries are ok, I didn't really eat much of them. you get a lot. The devil dog I liked, wasn't spicy and I might order again but id probably try something different next time with all the choices.

found this place on the list for restaurants during AZ restaurant week. we didn't do the special but I wanted to try this place. any place that makes their own moonshine I have to try. The guy waiting on us was a trip, he was a little rude and brash, it bothered some but I didn't care.  I ordered the special of the day, smoked prime rib.  It was one of the best prime rib ive ever had and possibly the best ive ever had.  I unfortunately didn't get to try the house made moonshine but I will be back to try it and maybe on a sunday again to get the prime rib.

was able to come last year for the inaugural season at Cubs park, 2nd year and now its called Sloan park,  I was kind of upset that Ho Ho Kam wasn't the park anymore but this park blows away all the other spring training parks.  Almost all of the seats are in the shade and you cant beat that. The grass seats are in the sun.  Some many cool little things about this park.

I had been here a few years back while I was in town and didn't remember being here until I saw my review at another location and it was funny because I ordered the same burger and the same Turtle as last time. atleast Im consistent I guess. too bad we don't have one close to home in Cali.

my 2nd zipps I have been too and this one blows away the other one. Talked my Grandma into coming here with a friend and some other family members to watch some football.  This place is massive and has tvs everywhere compared to the other zipps ive been to. This is the one you want to come watch football at.  I ordered the green chili burger and a few zipperitas and everything was great.  When im back in town I will come here to watch some sports and eat.

valet parking, serious?  Service was ok,  I ordered 2 pieces of chicken and a waffle. The waffle was ok , nothing special to me but my cousin really liked it. The chicken was great, one of the best. not sure ive ever had skin on a chicken like this. It kind of puffed up and separated from the meat and was delicious,

ive been telling my cousin about this place for a year or so, ever since we had one open up by us in Claremont. We had the chance to bring him and his wife her after dinner to check it out. not that the Claremont people are not friendly but they are really friendly and more out going here. My cousin and I tried a bunch of the whiskey and found a couple we liked. My daughter ended up getting some oil.

I wasn't expecting much when we came here but I told my daughter about this place and she could design her own donut. They make the donuts after you order them, They look like they will be heavy and dense but that are really soft and perfect. We ordered a dozen and I ate 4!! and I liked them all

came here with all my Phoenix family. I ordered the brisket sandwich and the green chili mac n cheese. My cousin recommended this place and I warned the family that I wasn't the one because its usually me. I wish I was the one because it was pretty good.  My brisket was tender and good flavor. a good mac n cheese is really hard to find and this one might be one of my favorites.  My grandma gave me half of her pulled pork sandwhich and I didn't touch it, the bread was completely soaked and the pulled pork looked like sloppy joe, my aunt complained about hers also.  stick to the brisket or tri tip and stay away from the pulled pork
