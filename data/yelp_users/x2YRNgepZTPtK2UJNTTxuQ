I called VERY last minute to ask for a special order on a cake for my mom's birthday cake and the very sweet woman who answered made it happen for me! Not only was she able to put everything I wanted on it, but she made it fresh and had it ready in only a few hours. When I went in to pick it up, it looked exactly how I had imagined. Since I was there I picked up a few cupcakes for one of my employees birthdays and the girls said that they were AMAZING! I will definitely be going back to this gem. I wasn't disappointed at all!

I loved the whole staff and especially Dr. Robert Giles. I am a patient for life! I highly recommend Chandler Eyecare.

This review is not related to the food, weird I know. It is, however, because not only once but twice we have been 'turned away' so to speak. The first time, we showed up at the restaurant with about 8 people... They couldn't accommodate us which was fine because it was late and we didn't make a reservation. This time I knew better! I called to make a reservation for next Friday- we are going out with friends to celebrate my husbands birthday and he is craving seafood. The hostess who answered the phone was very polite and sweet, but said they don't take parties of 15 on the weekends. She said that she would put me on hold and ask the manager... She came back and politely told me that the manager said they just can't do a party like that on a weekend. Welp... That's pretty crummy. We love good food and strong drinks and our money is as green as the other 15 people who will be dining at the salt cellar instead of us. I don't know about you, but I'm not one to go out and celebrate with friends mid-week. Just wanted to let you know if you're looking for a restaurant to celebrate with a group, this won't be the place for you.

I would give Sunchain as a whole no stars if that were an option. When I started tanning years and years ago in Old Town, it was nothing but pleasurable. However we moved to Chandler and I had to cancel my membership. Lo and behold I found a salon in Chandler/Gilbert and my husband got me a 3 month contract for Christmas and when the 3 months were up, I signed up for the month to month contract. Let's talk about how disappointing it was when that salon shut it's doors without any warning.... They refunded my money, but still have my lotion. That wasn't an altogether great experience, but I decided to give them another shot since they have a salon next to work. I walk in today to try and sign up and told her I was a member at the salon in Chandler that closed, and she acted like I was making it up to try and get a free membership? She was less than professional the WHOLE time I was there, and I am pretty stunned they would treat someone that way who has used their services for so many years. I have the emails from the last store they closed which I would have been happy to provide, but I'm no longer interested in doing business with a company who doesn't care about their clients, the people who keep their business running.

Valle Luna has always been amazing but tonight we came here for a quick bite after unpacking and my hubby had what we would probably say is the best thing on the menu!   He ordered the Sonoran enchilada dinner with red pork and let me tell you it was ABSOLUTELY fantastic! We should have taken a picture of it before he devoured it, but it's a little too late! We definitely recommend it!

The roasted half chicken was absolutely amazing. It has the best rub on it and is cooked just right! The only problem last night was, three of us from the group ordered it and they ran out of mashed potatoes! :(:(:( This is an obvious bummer as we were all looking forward to that side of potatoes, but they did offer us another side instead. The waitress was okay, but she definitely brought one of our buddies the wrong beer. Since they come opened by the bartender, he didn't bother asking for the correct beer. All in all, they have GREAT food. I definitely recommend it!

Nothing short of an amazing experience! I had a haircut with Rachael and she did a fabulous job! It is a very cute salon with great stylists and I will DEFINITELY be going back to see her. She is so knowledgable and listened to exactly what I wanted. I have an amazing hair cut and am so happy!

Amazing little wine bar! They have some seriously wonderful appetizers. You can't go wrong with the cheese board, the flatbreads, the charcuterie board, or the warm brie... They're all to die for! OH, the olives are great too! I wasn't thrilled with the shrimp and tomatoes to be honest, but that was my only disappointment. One more thing I was simply so bummed about was they discontinued the rock shrimp and that was my FAVORITE. I still ask every time I go in just to see if they will bring it back. :) You just cannot beat the wine and beer selection, the delicious food, and the great ambiance. This is a must try!

If I could add an extra star, I would. I have never eaten in the restaurant, but I have ordered delivery several times. I am a creature of habit so I usually always order the Hong Kong Noodle Soup and the crab puffs because they are delicious- but tonight I changed it up a bit. On the recommendation of the sweet lady on the phone, I order the Indonesian fried rice. It was unbelievably flavorful and had a nice kick to it. I also ordered the braised beef stew and it was THE best soup I have ever had in my life! I cannot even find the words to tell you how amazing this soup is! I work right across the street at the apartment complex and I will be recommending this to all my residents and coworkers. Don't miss out on this gem!

Okay it was my first time at canes today. The manager was FANTASTIC. He asked if it was our first time There and I said yes... He walked is through the menu and took our rather large order for a big group (to go). He offered us a drink while we waited and had an excellent persona. I appreciate his Customer service and will definitely be going back!
