I walked into Best Buy trying to decide what digital camera to buy.  I have been a customer for many of years and have found out that I can always go into the camera section and walk out comfortable and confident in anything I purchase.  I have been in there several times for cameras, cam corders etc and I always try to find one employee named Tammy.  She has never pointed me in the wrong directions, always has a wealth of knowledge to give me and always has a positive attitude.  I went in there about a week ago looking for a new camera for two big vacations and tolf her what I am specifically looking for.  She answered all of my questions honestly and straight forward.  She also helped me save money buy buying other accessories that I will definitely use.   If I ever go in there I look for her or patiently wait for her to finisih up with a previous customer, so I can ask any and all questions knowing she will guide me in the best direction.  I went on one of my two trips and so far the camera is awesome.  I did buy an extra battery because I thought I would need it, but I went 6 days of nonstop photo taking and it still shows a full battery. The pictures turned out great and I am very happy with my purchase.  The true test is when I am in Ireland and trying to capture the beautiful scenery and all the memories that I will have.

They could care less about local residents coming and enjoying the hotel and restaurants. I called 2 months in advance to book a reservation using a 2 night complimentary stay (No blackout dates or restrictions) at their resort I had purchased through the Phoenix Zoo Charity. They had told me that they could not guarantee me a room due to it being the weekend of the Waste Management Open and all the rooms being reserved for the major corpoartions like WM. They said to check back closer to the date, so I did, I called back first week of January and after dealing with 3 reservation hosts, who could not tell me if they had availabitlity, they finally transferred me to a person higher up. He said they could not allow me to use it for that weekend because they had 5% availability, I asked him why and  expressed that there were no restrictions and he continued to tell me that it was not possible. I insisted on speaking with the Reservations Director Mark Petrov who finally confirmed that I was able to use it for Friday evening but they had no availability for Saturday night and that I would be placed on the waitlist for Saturday night. At this point I was a little more happy, knowing I have one night and possibly a second depending on WM group not using their 300+ room block.  I contacted them back the Monday prior to my stay to see where they were with the room allotment and how it was looking for Saturday night. The woman I spoke to about that said "well, did they call you and tell you a room opened up? I kindly said no, and that I was just checking and seeing how it was looking, so we could kind of get an idea and plan around it one way or another. "She replied well they will call you if something does open up " in a rude manners.  I waited until thursday to call again to see if they could update me on my status for Saturday. They told me that they had no rooms available. After that phone call I thought to myself, I truly do not believe they have not had anything open up, especially after all the crazy weather throughout the country. I took it upon myself to call ask if I could book a room for Saturday night, after finding out they did have rooms available and I a was able to BUY a room, but not be contacted for being on the waitlist, I decided to book it.  Then I called up Mark Petrov( Reservation Director) and he continued to try and tell me that they werent rooms available, then I told him, then how could I just have booked one? Totally caught him off guard and I honestly could not stop arguing with him and questioning him about it. Then he said that the waitlist guests have not been contacted yet but were going to be called in the morning. At this point it was becoming too funny to argue with. He started apologizing profusely and then said we will take care of it. I was like, well that was the reason I booked the room, because you did not.  After that we checked in Friday, I asked to speak with him personally and after 10 minutes of waiting for him, he came out apologized and gave me... 2 free "well drinks or beers" drink tickets.  We ended up trying to go to dinner at La Hacienda restaurant there on the resort grounds. I will post a review about that as well separately. Today I checked my credit card statement and after all of that, they still charged my credit card for a room after he said he would make sure they charity certificate would be allowed.

Would have loved to enjoy a few after-dinners drinks with my girlfriend at this spot many friends have suggested we check out. Hours on the doors say Friday-Saturday 11am-11pm. They also say that on their yelp page.  We walked in just a few minutes after 10, walked up to the bar and asked the bartender if they were closed. Her response was "if it's 10, then yes" as she went to check the time on her computer to confirm it was 4 minutes past 10. I followed her reply by saying that the sign outside the door says 11 and got no response as she turned her back to us, so we decided to find another nearby restaurant.   We have heard great things about this place and the two of us just wanted to check the place out before trying it for dinner.  Not a very warming first impression nor does it make us feel like we want to go back.
