The clubhouse is no more, was converted into the new leasing office. People still allow their dogs to crap all over the place and do not pick up (even with bags). The hot water still takes forever to get hot. The complex is starting to get noisy, with neighbors up talking loudly at night or going in and out of their apt.  Oh there are also tons of cats that just roam the complex (not sure if they are strays or irresponsible pet owners). Oh the best part, rent goes up without fail every year. I can assure you this complex is not worth more than $700 a month. It's convenient, due to close proximity to the 51, however, the main street traffic has increased and people love to play chicken with the cars (they run or walk across the street with no warning). Oh and if something needs to be fixed, you will be "warned" the HOA might charge you if the cause of the issue is found to be your fault. Oh yeah and within the first year of living here three cars were broken into with items or parts stolen. The complex hired a night security company that will come on the weekends to drive through the complex once and leave.  I have seen them on occasion get out of the vehicle to check to make sure something is locked.

This is a hole in the wall type place, it is very small and gets crowded. That being said, the service was good. It appeared clean (although I did not check out the restroom). The Egg drop soup was very good (and I am normally not a fan of that soup). The egg rolls, just stay away from them. They are horrible, like seriously. I ordered broccoli beef. The plates are massive. The food was ok. It wasn't a bad experience, but I am not impressed, and probably will not be back.

New look same great taste!  I actually liked the old look, the building was unique and stood out. But hey, I came to eat not stare at the building.  Ha! The food here never fails!  Need a good lunch, a meal befor going out or somewhere after a car show (am I showing my age? Lol) this is your place!! If your counting calories, stop it and come do your mouth a favor! You will not be disappointed!

Never had a bad experience here! Sometimes the service can be slow if the theater is full, but other than that, service is usually pretty good. The food is decent. The selection could be better. The drinks are good and usually change, where the are specialty mixes.

My first time at this location. The staff was backed up. I believe there was a mix up from a previous order and it threw  all other orders out of whack. The staff was not that friendly (stress from falling behind perhaps). Either way my food sat on the preparation counter for at least 5-7 min before the next person in line was able to add my toppings.  I inquired if my meat and beans would be hot, he wanted to talk about salsa.  I finally got him on the same page as me and was assured my meal would be satisfactory.  Fast forward,  i sit down (I've used about 20 min of my lunch hour by now) and noticed my food is drowning in juice (picture attached) and my hot food items were room temperature. This will be the first and last time I come to this location.

Great place!  I was in Chandler for a softball game. I wanted some froyo and saw this place on yelp. Very clean establishment, bath room was clean as well. Good customer service. The chocolate froyo is some of the best I have every had! I highly recommend. If I am ever on this side of town again, I will def come back.

I recently moved to this side of town and wanted a nail place closer to home. Place was clean, customer service was good. They did a decent job on my mani/pedi. My only complaints: my nail tech cut me too deep while trimming my cuticles and she clipped the side of my nails (when they didn't need it). I will not be back.

Love the salon and personal touches that you see throughout.  Tina is amazeballs!!! I've known her since forever.  I came to her with a hair problem and she found a solution.  She is excellent on cutting, styling and color (the services she has performed on my hair). She is personable, professional and super sweet! She takes the time to listen to what you want and brings it to life. Let her touch your hair, you will not be disappointed!

Delicioso! Awesome experience from the time we walked in the door until we left.  We were immediately greeted and escorted to a table. Drinks, appetizers were beyond amazing!  Guac and margaritas is what we had. I had the carne asada and the husband had the pollo relleno. Dessert was sopapilla!  Mike D. was our waiter and treated us like royalty!  It's a small place but great ambiance.  I really liked the intimate vibe.  The music playing was great too! Highly recommend and will come back!

Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! I loved the food selection.  I ordered a create your own bowel with chicken. All the food looked and tasted fresh. The smoothies are made on the spot with fresh whole ingredients.  I had the strawberry. It's set up like a Subway or Chipotle where you stand in line and they make your meal as you walk along. Be warned, the line around lunch can be very long. Staff was friendly and helpful for a first timer as well.

This place is amazing! The atmosphere, decor, service and food were all top notch! My husband and I came here about a week ago after a very long day. We had an unfortunate death in the family we were dealing with and just needed to unwind. Our waiter was JK (Hi JK!!). As first timers he took the time to explain the menu to us and made sure we felt welcomed.  We ordered the cajun fries and hush puppies.  OMG!!! They were delicious! We ordered beer which came out very cold. He was attentive to our table checking back often but not too often. I ordered the trifecta mussels mild with red potatoes.  There was soooo much flavor in this bag (a good thing). To me the mild was a little on the spicy side, so next time I will have no spice. My husband ordered the trifecta lobster with corn and sausage, hot. He was very pleased with his meal. This is not an intimate restaurant, it is not meant to be an intimate restaurant. You are to come here, have fun and laugh. I really enjoyed the writing on the walls. It is messy on purpose as they give you a bib and there is an industrial sized sink to was your hands. It can be be noisy, but again I was not expecting a quiet, dimly lit establishment.  In my opinion this would be a prefect place to have a celebration!
