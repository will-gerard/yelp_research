If you're looking for a boutique hotel, this is great. It's not a "resort," though; It's a converted apartment complex. Very Melrose Place. There are only 30 rooms, 2 stories, with a courtyard as the central focal point. One pool. One spa. It's quaint. There are pros and cons to this. You get to know your neighbors well, for better or worse. We came for spring training so there were groups of guys staying here. I was the only chick in the building, it seemed. So I felt really uncomfortable going in the spa with 10 dudes in there. For reasons like this, a bigger hotel may be better, but depends what you're looking for.  The design is really cool. Palm Springs mid-century modern style. You'll get some cool pictures.   One bit of advice: Don't book a "luxury suite." The floorplan of every room seems just about the same. The finishings are just slightly different. We had a "luxury suite" and it was not much different than our friends' regular room...but the price was double. WEIRD.  Random facts about the rooms: -There's a full kitchen with fridge (convenient for beer, water, whatever) -The showerhead is suitable for someone 7-feet tall. Seriously -There is no TV in the bedroom; just in the main room  It's pretty loud because it's so intimate and people tend to hang out in the courtyard until pretty late. Earplugs worked for me. Even though you can hear what's going on outside, you can't hear anything going on in other rooms. The walls are brick--nice.  Our room did have AC.  I kept thinking it would be fun to rent out the whole place for a bachelor/bachelorette party, or even a wedding. Definitely good for groups.  We walked into downtown Scottsdale--just about a mile or so. A cab ride would be cheap too.  I'd come back here. Oh, we came during spring training, so I'm sure prices were jacked up for that.

I love coming to breweries when I visit a new city. This one didn't disappoint. The location kind of sucked--in a strip mall some blocks away from the downtown Scottsdale action. I still think it's worth a trip. Great beer selection--both local and not. They only have a couple they brew themselves and I wouldn't recommend them, to be honest. They have TVs to watch sports, darts, and board games just lying around. Really fun. I can speak highly for the pizza but didn't try anything else. Good place.

I wish this restaurant was in the middle of the downtown action...but it's not...and you can't really fault a restaurant for its location. At least it has a parking lot so you don't have to hassle with the parking like you do downtown.  This is a really classic-feeling steakhouse. Very dim lighting, sports on TV, a centrally-placed bar. It feels fancy, though we showed up in sandals. It's not pretentious at all.  I got the pan seared trout...very good with the crunchy skin. I recommend the "FGT" as a side... some kind of four grain rice thingie. The appetizers are all great, especially the crab-stuffed mushrooms and toasted raviolis. You can get a bottle of wine in the $30-$40 range--not bad. The service was friendly. All the meat-eaters at my table loved their cow.

This is my kind of place: Beer made on site, awesome food menu, cool crowds, sports on TV. I would consider living in Arizona just for this place...well, ok, maybe not. But I will come back here.  For beers, I'd recommend the Raj IPA and the Kiltlifter (which you will find offered at nearly every bar in Tempe, by the way).  They have some good vegetarian options, which made me happy. I went for the Portabella Veggie Beer Bread. I have to say that the title made me think it would be a portabella mushroom sandwich. It's actually a wrap. And I'm not sure how it's "beer bread"; it just seemed like a tortilla. But it was good anyway.   Definitely go for the fries, no matter what. They are beer battered and delicious. I'd recommend the calamari appetizer too, but beware it's strips of calamari, like chicken strips.  Enjoy!

I call this type of place "fancy schmancy." It might have been a little too sophisticated for our group on this particular night. It was packed even around 8pm (on Friday), but we got a table in the bar area. We wanted to start with shots of Jamison and were told they don't have shot glasses. So, yeah, it's that kind of place.  BUT...the food is DELICIOUS. I started with the kale salad and it was incredibly tasty. Very good flavors. They don't have many vegetarian options for entrees. In fact, I think they have just one, which I got: the gnocci. Thankfully, it was probably the best gnocci I've ever, ever had. I challenge you to try it and disagree.  The have a good list of cocktails (I enjoyed a Manhattan) and wines. They hide beers on their last page because, yeah, it's that kind of place ;)

I may have given this place 5 stars if we didn't choose to sit outside in 50-degree weather, under their not-that-hot hot lamps. Being cold makes me grouchy.  In any case, the food was good. I got the spinach and green veggie omelet (with jarlsberg cheese). It was really, really good--very buttery, to warn you. It comes with a great hunk of fresh bread and AWESOME hash browns. I asked for a side of fruit too.  The service was really good, the kind of good where the waitress was bringing me a new iced tea before I even finished the current glass. Prices are pretty good for Vegas. It's hard to find a place to eat that isn't smack in the middle of a casino. This felt like an actual standalone restaurant.

The only negative? The wait. Be prepared to stand outside for a half hour or more on a weekend. They have coffee and cucumber water to enjoy while you wait, though. And it IS worth the wait. Their omelets are delicious, as are the breakfast potatoes. Mmmm. The breakfast nachos were a great hit with our table, too. Everyone liked their food except for one of our friends who got the hangover sandwich. He said there was way too much going on and it made his hangover worse. Ha. He also said the bloody mary "tasted weird." But, he was hungover, so take that with a grain of salt ;)

I'm not sure why this restaurant does not have higher ratings. We had ZERO complaints, and that's unusual.   We gave the wine guy a price range for a wine and a general idea of what we like, and he picked out a wonderful Zin. We loved it. Our waiter was awesome. I wish we got his name--Asian guy. He explained the menu to us in detail and gave us great recommendations. What I like about this place is that you can get cheeses and appetizers that are relatively inexpensive and will fill you up.  We started with: -Ricotta fritters: 6 balls of cheese, rolled in bread crumbs and fried in peanut oil. TO DIE FOR -Lentils "alla Toscana": really tasty if you're a lentils fan -Panteleo cheese: A goat cheese--delicious -Taleggio cheese: A cow's milk cheese--also delicious  Like I said, these were all really reasonably priced and we were pretty full with them. Not full enough to skip an entree, of course. Who do you think we are?!  We decided to split the eggplant pizza. The dough was perfect--soft, but crisp. I worry about eggplant (and other veggies) making the dough soggy, but this didn't have that issue at all.  For dessert, we got the Otto Sundae. If you don't splurge on this, at least get the gelato by itself. It's housemade and SO GOOD.

I have high expectations for weekend breakfasts. I want them to be relaxing and leisurely, first of all. This place was neither of those. There were a TON of people swarming the place so the atmosphere was really frenetic and all the servers seemed annoyed and frazzled. I realize why they want you to order at the front--because if they served you like a regular place, they'd have to take off the cost of things on your bill because they messed up. So, yeah, you order at the counter and wait. And wait. And wait. We saw multiple tables get their food before us. We waited literally a half hour. We asked what was up and they said our order was lost somehow. Eyeroll. Thankfully, they got it out quickly after that, without utensils. I went to get some and found the utensil holder empty. The waitress said the forks were coming. Some kind of dishwasher delay. Uh, what kind of restaurant doesn't have forks? So then my food got cold. Worst of all, because I was so starving by the time I got to eat, the serving size didn't do it for me. It's not generous at all. It's like those gourmet places with tiny portions. I left hungry.
