I've lived a rock's throw away from this joint for over 6 months now, and I didn't even realize the absolute gem that is Feeney's, until this afternoon!  I had heard an excellent review of their salad bar at work from a client, and decided to check it out! The overall feel of the place is welcoming, and up beat!  The dimly lit atmosphere is reminiscent of a dive bar (in a good way), but Feeney's is WAY cleaner and well maintained.  I saw a lot of reviews saying that the vibe was reminiscent of restaurants before major chains were the norm, and where as I may be a little young to remember such a time, I can see what they mean, and agree! Today, I actually decided to stop by to grab a quick salad to go (since I had heard that salad bar was awesome, and it is), but a quick look at their daily special (caramelized apple pork chop, oh em gee AH-MAZING!) and I knew it wouldn't be a salad dinner for me!  The menu has a lot of unique options that you don't see often, including their soup of the day, a Louisiana style seafood soup, london broil and even ESCARGOT!  I can honestly say I've never seen escargot on a menu before!  So I find their menu not only intriguing, but incredibly special!  Some of their dishes are a little on the pricey side, but you certainly get what you pay for, not only in quality and quantity of the food, but also in SERVICE! I myself work in the service industry, and I know how frustrating it can be, but as a result, I hold customer service to a high standard.  Feeney's blew my standards out of the water!  It took only a few minutes to be greeted by Judy, the fabulous bartender, who gave me a lunch and dinner menu to browse through.  I had a few minutes before another gentleman (I'm sad to say I can't remember his name) offered me advice on what to expect from various dishes.  I ended up deciding on the special of the day (that super-delicious caramelized apple pork chop), and a chocolate martini (crafted deliciously by George, co-owner). Both George and Judy were so fantastic to interact with, even going so far as to introduce me to the cooks, and other patrons!  I even left with a bag of grapefruits to take to my co-workers tomorrow and A HUG!  Which is a big deal if you know me, because I'm a hugger!  I've had some pretty awesome customer service in my day, but I can't think of a time or place when I have ever felt so welcome at an establishment I've never been to!  It's clear that the people at Feeney's take pride in their work and I can't wait to go back! From the menu to the staff, Feeney's is a breath of fresh air!  I would recommend this restaurant to ANYONE!

My family and I went to this studio for the first family photos we've taken in well over half a decade, and were helped by a gentleman named Caleb.  I'll admit, we were a little late for our appointment, but when we arrived, he told us that he'd have to get us in "when he can."  No time frame.  The wait actually wasn't to bad, maybe 10 or 15 minutes, but when he took us back to take the pictures, he was clearly rushing through a series of generic pictures and poses, clicking away so fast, the flash felt like a strobe light!  When we were going through the pictures before our purchase, we got a FEW fairly cute pictures of my little niece, one good picture of my sister and myself, but not one DECENT family picture!  Who h was our whole purpose of going!  So after what felt like being pressured to settle on pictures for packages over $300, we asked to reshoot our family portrait.   We did eventually find pictures and a package that we liked, a little basic photo editing being required.  We were told to come pick the pictures up in an hour, and left content (if not experiencing some buyer's remorse) with our selections and purchases. An hour later we come back, and our pictures still aren't quite finished and had to wait over 15 minutes for our order to be processed.  After returning to our vehicle we decided to sneak a peak at our pictures.  Over half the photos were cropped poorly, and NONE of the photo editing we had been promised was done!   We started this process at 4:30, it's now pushing 8:30 and we're still waiting for our "professional" family portraits. Family photos are supposed to be a fun and easy experience.  This has been neither fun nor easy! Ordinarily I with a review like this, I would only give 1star (less if that we're an option) but while waiting for our pictures the first time, I did witness some amazing customer service, which i believe should be recognised.  The associate not only walked her clients to the door, which she held for them, but also literally ran to their car to give them something they had forgotten.  Had she been the one to help us, I'm sure this review would have been much different, but Caleb obviously could not be bothered to deliver even passable customer service.

So like many people this time of year, I'm trying to eat healthier, so I decided to replace my lunch with a healthier Jamba Juice Smoothie.  So I asked about the carrot cayenne drink.  It's probably my fault for not asking the right questions, because when I asked how it was, the clerk said it was popular today.  So I paid my $6, left an extra for a tip and waited for my medium smoothie.  Apparently I ordered a $7, room-temperature spicy carrot juice.  They did however, with attitude, offer to upsize my room-temperature carrot juice lunch, for $9!!  My spicy carrot juice would have tasted better had I been given more information about it than "It's popular today," and had it been served with a bit less attitude, but even then, I still wouldn't say it's worth $7.

When they say "Best" I'm not sure if they mean the food or the service, but either way they are RIGHT!  My drink was never empty, the staff was super informed, very friendIy, and welcoming!  I had the gnocchi and it was, tender, not too dry and clearly expertly hand made!  And the sauce?  To die for!  I don't know what they put in it, but it has this distinctly different flavor, in the best way possible!   Then!  THEN there are the canollies!  Canollies so delicious, so authentic, I'm relatively certain they have angles making them in the back! I don't care where in the valley you live, this place is worth the drive!!
