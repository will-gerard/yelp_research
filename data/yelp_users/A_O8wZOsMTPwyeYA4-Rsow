The McManager sucks.  (he wouldn't run his store Safeway card for me!)  The debit/credit card swipers suck! (they don't fit in their holders and they must use a freakin' dialup modem they are so God Damn slow)  They once completely ran out of MILK!  Their change machine was down for well over a week!  I swear to God, if  there were any alternative in the vicinity I'd GLADLY pay twice the price to shop there!   Revamped store is nice to look at, shitty to shop at!    Now with free Wi-Fi!   EAT ME!

This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.    The outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.  My hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.    My girl Jacqui liked her entree.

NOT JUST THE WORST SERVICE, BUT NO SERVICE AT ALL!  What was once a perfectly fine establishment has taken a major decline this year. I've been going here for the past three years to watch the Packers on game day. The food has always been exceptional and the service wonderful  This year it's sucks far below acceptable levels.  Two weeks ago we sat at our table and we waited 40 minutes until we saw our server. And this only after my girlfriend went to the bar and explain our situation.  This week I sat down (in a sparely populated bar) and after not being given a menu, asked for a drink order or even acknowledged I decided not to go to the bar and wait and see just how long this would last. I watched an entire three quarters of a football (2+ hours) without ever so much as being acknowledged as existing! When I sat down table next to me was covered with the last customers leftovers and was not cleared until right before I left by what I assume was my waiter. In doing so he walk right past me and my empty table TWICE never to return.  UTTERLY PATHETIC

WOW! I LOVE this place and I can't believe it took me this long to check it out.  The interior is incredibly original and equally funky and cool. The menu is mostly sandwiches of which are not may favorite ... but they have a great beer selection and it's a super cool place to hang out.  Big ups!

This review is not a review of the store but of AT&T wireless service in general.  AT&T is the worst wireless service I've ever had.  I have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier I've had, and I've had Verizon, T-Mobile (the best) and now AT&T.  I would have never switched service if I didn't have to in order to get my iPhone.  And for the record ... the iPhone is the best object I've EVER owned.  I recommend you avoid AT&T wireless at all costs (unless you want the best phone in the world, only then is it worth it).

Pizza by-the-slice, and it sucks.  The pizza crust is spongy and the rest of the pizza just lacks much flavor at all.  They have a "two slices and soda" lunch special which, if I recall correctly, is under $6.  If you just need to fill your gut with something ... why not?  It's just rather depressing that there's really no good place to get a decent slice in downtown Phoenix.

I'm typically not a BBQ fan but after having a sample of Honey Bear's BBQ Chicken Sandwich at a street fair I'm now a believer.   The sauce has a warm and sweet taste and the pulled Chicken looks to be all white meat and quite tasty.  The only things that suck: the buns instantaneously decompose under the liquid BBQ sauce (making it a fork dinner rather than a sandwich) ... also they don't have Coke or Pepsi (only Dr. Pepper for the cola selection).

An art/performance studio AND music venue (All Ages [as they regretfully have no liquor license]) focusing on regional creativity and the occasional national touring act.  The interior is beautiful, extremely intimate and the PA/sound is great.  Unfortunately I find the booking to be based around MySpace bands ... lots of children (who mostly are friends of the young bands playing) and sadly zero liquor ...

GRREAT place!  The burgers and fries are great (although as previously stated the burgers are a little small but the quality makes up for it) ... (I've posted a picture)  **** note they don't take credit/debit cards ****  The neighborhood isn't the greatest but no biggie.  I have to say best part was the service!  After ordering and telling them I'd eat outside they asked if I had a dog, I said yes, and he said "I'll get you a bowl of water before anything else."  SOOOOOO cool!  They CLEARLY take GREAT care an food prep ... they wear latex gloves and unlike other like places .... when dealing with the money part they take off the gloves!  Highly recommended!!!

The place is really nice, my tenderloin was small but really good.  I liked it, you would to (if you like really nice kinda fancy places)...   But I don't know ... I guess it's the kind of place that married men take their girlfriends.  Or the place you take your wife (the one you still like) the day after her Mom died.  Or in my case ... if you just want to feel like the second youngest person in the room (my date Jacqui J won first place, hands down).  Nothing is wrong with this place, it's just ... well it's not bar food and there was no jukebox with Johnny Cash in it.  Not only that, when I asked for a can of Blatz they looked at my like I was an alien.  And not a spork in the house!  And get this, they took cloth and made it into napkins!  Weird stuff!  But seriously  ... the place is cozy (almost to much) ... the food is in small portions (at least mine was) and kinda pricy.  It was just what I expected.  No more, no less.  A solid 4 no doubt.  And any restaurant that tries to make a go of it on 7th Freeway/Street ... God Bless 'em!

This place CLAIMS to be a "punk rock" bar  ... it's not what I'd consider a Punk bar ... way to many rednecks ... This is NOT a cool place ... and the booking is God awful. Skip this place and head to the TT Roadhouse ... Hell even the Rogue is better than this place.

The same pizza as Pizza Bianco but with no wait and plenty of seating.  I always get the Margrita pizza which is out of this world (with a very smokey taste).  Mexico cokes and community seating (as well as a bar to "belly up to").

Wendy's new BREAKFAST blows!  I've never been a huge fan of Wendy's food, however seeing their big window sign of their new breakfast sandwiches drew me in.  My God they looked good!  And my God was I disappointed.    I had a sausage biscuit with a kick ass looking buttermilk bun that was infused with syrup.  The meat was spicy (ala McDonnalds) but the rest was just yucky.  I highly recommend you skip Wendy's for breakfast.  Bummer.

The best help I've ever had in a Hardware store!    This place is SWARMING with staff willing to help you. All of them wear goofy red Hawaiian shirts so you clearly know who is there for your benefit. The place is medium sized but they always seem to have two registers open, basically insuring that you are in and out in a very speedy manner.  I don't know why you would shop anywhere else ... nothing against Home Depot but I'm done with you. Service is king!

Pizza is like sex.  Even bad pizza isn't half bad.  Well my first girlfriend and this place have proven that old age adage NOT to be true.  Zero, and I mean ZERO flavor in this pizza.  I'm all about the sauce and this sauce has the distinct flavor of water.  And where in the heck do you find flavorless Pepperoni?  Where ever you do, that's where these guys shop!  Yikes!

The WORST Best Buy I've ever been to.  I was charged $231.27 for an AMP install ... and they crossed the wiring so my right speaker was in the front left and the left speaker was in the right back ... and it kept shorting out on me.  And it sounded like compete shit (go figure) because they never played with the settings.  I went to the Manager Kevin S (he would NOT give me his last name) and he was a total unhelpful prick.  Anthony was the kid who f'ed up my install ... finally I got Keith to FIX the mess up ... Shop ANYWHERE but this store run by complete ASSHOLE PRICKS.  And what ever you do don't let Anthony touch your vehicle!

HOLY SMOKES! I now have FOUR favorite Phoenix pizza places!   With pizza I'm all about the sauce, and this is the shizz! Yeah it's sweet, like really sweet but I freakin' LOVE it! It's soooooooooo good that I don't even want a topping,  just cheese and that fabulous sauce! This maybe my new favorite pizza but it's such a tough call.   For the record ... the best in Phoenix (for me) ... in no particular order.  Pizza A Metro (pepperoni)  Spinato's (cheese)  Cibo (Diavola which is the best topping I've ever had on a pizza) Pane Bianco  All three just rock my world, man do I LOVE Spinato's!

Very "neat" place.  My neighbor/friend Melissa works there ... she's a cute little neo-hippy and an obsessive organic farmer. So I assure you that the food is locally grown and organic.    She a vegan and sometimes she has to chase chickens (that cracks me up).  Nothing here is deep fried or drenched in grease, so it's not really my kinda place.  Then again I'm certainly not your typical diner.  No doubt, NORMAL people would LOVE this place

I moved in here right when they first opened and moved out in early 2002.  The place was SOOOOOO nice.    When I was there they keep the place in top notch shape, had a concierge service, fax and mailing from the front office, and served food and drinks at the pool (which you could charge to your bill!).  Really nice gym, two tennis courts and a bunch of common areas with grills and water fountains.  This place truly was "resort living" ...   After 9/11 I decided to get back to the basics and moved out to get a Golden Retriever.   I miss San Melia!

Holy CRAP! I found theeeeeeeeeeee most comfortable professional work pants here ... they look great (no freakin' pleats, thank you very much!). AND the hidden ingredient is a very small amount of Spandex entwined with the cotton giving them just a little bit of elasticity to make them insanely comfortable.  I'm thinking about buying a pair to use as pajama pants (well not quite but still .... ).

The place seem to ONLY serve as a quick stop for people attending a downtown event to get a drink or two prior to the event (The Dodge Theater, Suns or Diamondbacks).  Crowds come early and leave soon there after ... some may return after the event but I wouldn't count on it.  The peeps are either sports fans and/or music fans that enjoy seeing a show sitting down in a cushy seat (i.e. The Dodge Theater).  The fish dinner is good and Brittany the waitress even better (I'm a "big fan") ... but all-in-all ... not my cup of tea.

Totally great place to see small indie bands ...  Booked (in part) by Leslie Barton (whom cut her teeth @ Modified Arts) and this time there's DRINKS at her venue!  YEAH!!!  Small stage ... It's oddly shaped as the building used to be an auto dealership but still has good sight lines, even from the bar which is near the stage.

A REAL juke joint in Phoenix?  Who knew?  This place is authentically cool.  Granted the red lighting throughout the club takes a while to get used to but everything else just plain rawks!.  The bands play in a freakin' closet with NO stage!   I sh*t you not!  They have a small dance floor, which is usually filled will all walks of life.  Just a really cool authentic unpretentious blues club.  Big ups!

I had expected to get the ole smug  "what do you expect kid?  Your bike sucks!" look when I brought my $125 Target bike into this shop.  I also arrived 1/2 hour before close, so I had expected to just drop it off and get an estimate the following day.  Instead the guy just grabbed my bike put it up on a rack and went to work, no smug glance, nothing.  10 minutes, a little oil and a few adjustments later and he told me to take it out back and see how it rides.  It worked great, I returned to settle up, and he said "your good, no charge".  WTF!?!  With that kind of service ... you surely deserve the 5 stars.

Oh Scottsdale, you never fail to amaze me. Honest to God the entire staff had a nice orange glow to them straight from the tanning bed.

Oh Good Lord Baby Jesus.  How I loath clubs like these ... nothing againts this place ... just the genre in general.  I was there REALLY early but there were so few "ladies" and the guys for the most part looked like middle aged tools desperate for a date.  Then again, perhaps a large part of it may have had something to do with the party in celebration of a calendar of Big Ten college girls in swimsuits (how novel!).  This is EXACTLY why Scottsdale is ... well ... Scottsdale.

This is THEE local spot for mid sized nationally touring acts!  It's clean (a rarity in it's genre) and the sound and sight lines are GREAT.  It's an old theater with the seats taken out so you can get as close as you want (always general admission).    As of late they have been insanely anal about security at the door (you MUST take off your shoes!?!?) but other than that it's by far the best place to see a band in Phoenix!  They now are charging $5 for parking (and have taken over PUBLIC parking areas) ... now for big shows you have to walk a mile across the bridge to get in ... it really is a pain in the ass (combined with the door screening) ... so I'm downgrading this venue from a 5 star ...  Although they must know the set time (it's in the contracts) ... they REFUSE to tell you them ... in hopes that you spend MORE time here waiting and DRINKING (i.e. more money from their CAPTIVE audience.    Total assholes to their own customers ... now I've downgraded to a one star!

This rag looks cool.  They review all the trendy-ass-kissing bands.  They have a great layout.  And they want so badly to be a mover and a shaker in the community.     So what's wrong?  They (like a lot of publications) are entirely blinded by the bottom line (rather than readership), which is why you'll NEVER see them be even a little critical of ANY local business no matter how crappy they are.  Everything in this rag is GREAT and GROOVY and COOL.    All style.  Zero credibility.

I like it! I like it! I like it! It's cheap and good.  They salt the hell outta the fries and the burgers are grilled right in front of you. It's about 4 blocks south of the light rail, so it's easy to get to from the Light Rail. And you can get beer!  The interior is dark, sparse and a bit run down, but that's what they are shooting for so, so be it. Basically a damn good burger at a good price.

This is seriously the worst bargain in Las Vegas.  It's expensive and does NOT take you where you want to go!  NIce job city managers!!!  You would think that it would drop you off AT the Convention Center.  NOPE!  They seriously drop you off about 1/2-1/4 mile AWAY from the Convention Center at which point you have to walk across the ENTIRE HUGE black asphalt parking lot in the 100+ heat!  What a Fucking JOKE!  If you have a car ... just drive and park on-site ... it's WAY easier.

You really gotta be either insane or an idiot to mess with near perfection, and that's exactly what Lux did when they moved next door and added liquor to the mix.  Well that is unless I guess you really know what you're doing ... and the owners CLEARLY know what they are doing. This place is bigger and better than the old Lux and I never expected to say that.  This place is a diamond in the rough. There is no coffee shop within 300 miles that is this hip, this cool and this awesome.  Oh yeah ... the coffee is damned good to!

Sadly, this dining experience was a huge disappointment.  I had expected pizza to be on the menu (as reported by The AZ Rep.) but they had none.  As a matter of fact, the menu only had about five entres to choose from.  I chose the steak and it was pretty bad.   The generous (but not inexpensive [$25]) piece of meat was drenched in some kind of gravy, of which was not good.   The meat felt and tasted like it was right out of the freezer.  My girlfriend's entre was some kind of pasta/potato dish (that she typically LOVES) and she did not like "even a little".   The interior was small, about seven tables total, and the walls were adorned with really nice modern art (and I'm guessing locally produced).  Unfortunately the setting was the best part of the experience.  They have no wine and a corkage fee of $7 per person (not per bottle).

OMG!  I think I just had one of the best burgers of my life here last night.  The best way I can describe the interior is that it's full-on Metrosexual.  My friend completely nailed it when she said "I wish I had the design sense to make soo much out of IKEA" ... I couldn't agree more.  Just amazingly design.  And thanks in part to Thomas, we couldn't have asked for better service.  YOU know Thomas as one of the most prolific and consistently hilarious Yelpers.  I've come to know him as a really nice unpretentious, and all around terrific guy.  He adds soo much to this site (and no doubt to FEZ) that I truly feel honored to have met this guy.  Go here and thank Thomas later ... you wont be disappointed.

Very Mod looking place ... but I found the food to be pretty bland and my carmel latte just okay ... DOG FRIENDLY patio a major plus for me and my dog.  Forgot all about this post until this came into my MySpace account from the OWNER!    Date:      May 27, 2006 8:02 PM   Flag spam/abuse. [ ? ] Subject:  hey dave Body:  i don't know you from adam...but i have to tell you how i feel about random folk posting negativity about drip coffee lounge. or any place for that matter. i find it totally lame. if you thought my organic food was bland, i'd much rather you tell me, talk to me about it so i could attempt to make it non bland for you....i wonder what you ordered? no you have to spew negativity into the world. curious if i was the barista that made your carmel latte??? regardless if you care enough to come back to drip i'll attempt to make you a beverage that suits your tastes. if it was easy i guess everyone and their brother would have a cafe.  From:  http://www.myspace.com/gbellgrrl   take care  ---End---  Well ... there you go ... building a community one person at a time!  I say the Lux "Community" is just fine ... and the coffee ... service much better ... I was originally being kind ... honestly this is the most pretentious place I've ever walked into ... and there is NOTHING cool about it ... zero substance ... only pretension ... fashion and style ... but so sorry you can't buy cool ... and this place proves it on a daily basis.

Sure libraries are almost irrelevant but this place is a Phoenix jewel for sure. The buildings outside is pretty nice, but inside it's a masterpiece. I'll spare you the descriptions of the glass elevators and the pools of water underneath ... but it's awesome, trust me.  Outside of that ... the entire Phoenix Public Library system is first rate. My favorite parts: they will ship the book you want to the nearest library to you, you can return the book to any location and they allow you to renew your books on-line (they give you an email when it's due and you just click through to re-up, so basically you can keep it as long as no one else wants the book).  First rate and awesome!

So I sit down at the bar ... I have a couple of drinks ... a new bartendress starts ... the girl next to me orders another drink and the bartendress asks her how many she's already had (and I thought that was odd because she was showing NO signs of drunkenness  but I thought maybe she knew her) ... I start talking to this guy at the bar who was talking kinda loud and she admonishes him ("saying I keep hearing you and thinking there's gonna be a fight" which was SO not the case (he was just being animated and talking to three people all at once while sitting at the bar.  I ask for another beer and she goes "Well okay but I think this should be your last" ... Now I've been a licensed bartender (in Wisconsin) and told not to "over serve" your customers ... but this was just crazy in my humble opinion ... I was NOT slurring my speech, nor was I loud or obnoxious ... No biggie but it was 8pm and I had not been there all that long ... nor had I drank too much (I had four drinks in two hours) ... So if your ever into "tying one on" (which I was not at the time)... this is definitely not the place to go!  Also I did not find the people here  extraordinary, and the jukebox either ... (typical Johnny Cash classics, punk and new wave standards better than most sports bars but nothing out of the ordinarily for a bar catering to "hipsters") ... and the bartender had her cleavage covered completely with ink (tattoos) which IMHO is a violation of hallowed ground ... and of course she just HAD to show the world ... just gross and boring IMHO ... I will not be back ... but your mileage may vary.  Clearly others think otherwise.

I once went to a movie with Alice Cooper here. I mean, grant it we weren't together but he was in the theater with us.  BSadly this is Phoenix's only multi-screen Art House theater.  They always have great movies.   I guess this place doesn't really deserve this rating but it is our ONLY choice. With that in mind, even the fact that it's in Scottsdale and the theaters themselves are just "okay" I'll give them props for the quality of films they bring to the Valley.

The owner was really nice ... he learned customer service from his time at Oreganos ... He is a good guy!  Treats his customers with mad respect ...  Although it's way outside my neighborhood ... I maybe occasionally be passing Lux and Drip to get here ... but this place is nice ... with zero pretentiousness.  The even play music that is inclusive not "exclusive" ... kinda a rarity for coffee shops IMHO ...

TOTALLY cool place ... the locally brewed "house beer" on tap is AWESOME ... and it's the ONLY lively bar downtown in the Roosevelt Area (sorry but Carly's is way laid back) ... and the decor is beautiful!!!  This will totally be my favorite bar in the neighborhood for years to come!!!  Thank you MATT (of Matt's Big Breakfast Fame)!!!  And do not leave without having the hot Pretzel ... you'll thank me! :)  Great new staff and the music has been updated ... yeah!

The perfect breakfast diner!  God I love this place.  Big portions of GREAT breakfast food in a CLASSIC diner setting.  The hasbrowns were greasy and awesome, pancakes and scrambled eggs were done PERFECTLY!    They have a bar and booth seating as well, and the place was filled with the sounds of the sizzling grill.  What a great place!

This Pizza is LAME.  I should have gone with my instinct that a downtown "pizza by the slice" pizza joint shouldn't be completely empty at 11:30am on a weekday and gone somewhere else, but I didn't.    The place was completely empty and it still took them 12 minutes to get me my two slices (which were huge).    I hate to say it, but the pizza completely sucked.  The crust was so rubbery that I couldn't pick up the slice without it flopping over.    For two slices and a coke I paid nearly $8 but I wouldn't have paid $2 for that "food".  I forced myself to eat one slice and then threw out the other.  Yuck

NEVER TRY TO GET A PRESCRIPTION FILLED HERE, NEVER!   Oh my God ... this place is the absolute worst ... it took them THREE MONTHS to change my Dr.'s fax number (they said it had to be done at Headquarters!) ... they regularly gave me double the amount of my 'sript ...  it takes a good 15mins to get a pre called in prescription (EVERY TIME!). They are DRASTICALLY understaffed, rude and incompetent. After a year of shit service, I'm finally done ... no more ... go anywhere but here ... trust me.

Awesome new wine/beer bar in Downtown (Evans-Churchill District) ... Absolutely beautiful and the local art on the wall is top shelf.  The Monday night that I was there was Punk Rock night ... playing old Clash, Suicidal Tendencies and Rocket From the Crypt at low to moderate volume which was pretty cool IMHO.  Lots of tables and plentiful seating at the bar.  This place is 1 1/2 blocks from my house ... Welcome to my new home!  ****UPDATE**** Kristen is a friend, and/but I have NO IDEA how she got that is Frat bar-esque.  Then again she's from Boston which I hear is a pretty hip place but I still can't believe that they have "cool" Frat Bars there.  I don't know how someone could possible call the patrons or staff "pretentious" ... and the constant mentions of this place being a "hipster" hangout I think is a bit of an overstatement.  Then again I guess for Phoenix standards, this place may pass for being that.  I've lived in Minneapolis and Milwaukee and in comparison I'd say this is just your "normal/average" cool people hangout.  The complaint about "comfy seats" I totally get.  Honestly I wish that The Roosevelt and Lost Leaf would swap furnishings.  You can't eat comfortably at The 'Velt (which severs food) and you can't get all that "lounge-y"/comfortable at The LL (which is VERY conducive to conversation).  I'd take away a couple of stars for the lack of couches/love seats, but I love the Lost Leaf so the 5 stars stay.  Also I sooooooooooo wish you could have a drink outside on the patio!

This is pretty cool.   A real downtown market with lots of independent farmers/vendors.  They now have expanded to Wednesdays (but it's not very popular).  Important note: **Most vendors don't take cash and there is no ATM on-site, so it's best to come with some cash on hand.**

Totally great park. I took my Golden Retriever here and she LOVED it.  The best part of the park, is by far, the swimming lake. Dogs can get into the water with a gradual slop. The water appeared to be clean enough so "all good" on that front. There was even an area where you could hose off your dog after the swim (I didn't and she didn't smell afterwards).  Best Dog park in AZ IMHO.  I've posted a video of the park here: http://tinyurl.com/3ua2sw

After hearing for years that this is Theeee Best Breakfast in town I finally checked it out.  Now I've been twice, and I just don't get it.  I just found NOTHING special about this place at all.  It's a cute breakfast dinner and the pancakes and waffles are ... well, pancakes and waffles.  Both times I've been we had to wait to be seated, and both times I didn't feel it was worth it.  In my opinion Palette, Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast are so much better.  Of course your mileage may vary.

I had to do it!  I paid the cover (right when the place opened) and took the elevator to the club.  What I was expecting I'm not sure but it surely wasn't this.  The view is amazing but I was not impressed.  They have dealers with bunny ears and their breast falling out (and I gotta say, they WERE amazingly beautiful and sexy women) but I believe the minimum bet was $50.  Not gonna do it!    The venue itself was TINY and lavish but nothing that you haven't already seen in Las Vegas.    I don't know why, but I just felt "dumb" just being there.

So 4 of 5 times I've been completely F'ed by this damn thing.  First I had an appointment and the train was 20mins late to arrive (and subsequently packed to the gills) and this was at 1pm in the afternoon!   Second time we nearly reached the end of the line and the train LOCKED up the breaks and we sat unmoving for 15mins, with not so much as a peep from the driver. Turns out they needed to "switch the tracks" to allow for another train to get by our train.  The fourth time the train HAD to stop and wait because they were ahead of schedule (making US late).  Then last night we were stopped mid route and told that we were waiting to switch drivers (and she hadn't arrived yet, so we just waited for 15mins).  This is the MOST undependable mass transit I've ever used.   I was originally sooo excited about this, only to find it managed by chimps.  Total FAIL!

Just a really nice, quite and laid back coffee shop.  Not to "trendy-ass-kissin'" ... just a nice place to kick back and/or get some work done.   Yes of course they have free wi-fi.    They are VERY dog friendly, and even supply a nice big water bowl (and treats) for your dog!

When you compare Fair Trade to Conspire and Lux ... ummm ... well ... there is no comparison ... Fair Trade's decor is BLAND and last time I went there the Barista was less than personable.  Also they lack the electrical outlets at every table which at this late state in the game is a fail for any coffeehouse.

Incredible service! With prices exactly the same as CVS or Walgreens why would you go anywhere else? They fill your script in 5mins of you handing it to them (dependent upon how busy they are).   The place is sooooo CenPho. Historic building restored, quaint and beautiful. Locally owned and operated by a native. Hell they even sell Hemp based lotions and such. This place is such a jem ... I can't recommend this place enough.

This is a lake.    It has water in it.  It's not very clean water.    The lake police will yell at you if you let your dog swim in the water.  That sucks.    I think it's semi-retarded to review a lake.

I've stayed here for the past 6-7 years and I have watched this place deteriorate into a seedy brothel.    WARNING!  You WILL be called on the phone by a prostitute in your room.  I promise!  It's happened the last two times I've stayed here (once at 3am).  This place is HELL!  The only reason why I've stayed here is because they take dogs.  Now I'm finally done and will NEVER stay here again.  This last time a prostitute was staying next door (she was walking the parking lot looking for clients!)  SERIOUSLY!  Look somewhere else.  Anywhere, just not here!

From the people who brought us The Emerald Lounge ... it's The Ruby Room!  What a beautiful place stuck in the middle of nowhere (just south of Downtown)!   I arrived at 9:45pm on Thursday night and the place was completely empty with the only exception being the bartender and DJ ...   ... at any rate the walls were set with local art work and the place has SO much potential (if you had ever been to The Emerald Lounge you know what I mean) ... Fingers crossed that more people catch on to this potentially VERY cool as hangout and live music and art venue!

My steak was barely warm and yet it was still the best I've had in years!  Drenched in it's own juices, my mouth is watering just thinking about it (and this was four days ago now!).  And I can not say enough about the vibe of this place!  It' s seriously more energetic than most nightclubs.  Hell, if your a complete bore your date will probably think you're vibrant just for sitting across from you while you're in this place.  Also worthy to note, while I was waiting for my drink, I was standing near the wait station and a waiter, just out of the blue, goes "How are you doing?" ... To which I thought,  Hold it!  Are you being nice to me and NOT fishing for a tip!?  How DARE you!!!!   So they seem to treat their employee's well and it shows!    I'm in Love.

***** Important Note ***** After posting this review I receive perhaps the nicest note from an owner one could possibly receive (even offering his phone number!)... CLEARLY the owner takes GREAT care and concern.  I am completely beside myself and I WILL be going back ...   What a bummer!    Honestly, this was BY FAR the worst breakfast experience I've EVER had.  1)  they had the front door propped open letting the diesel fuel and burning rubber smells waff about the place (from the light rail construction immediately outside the door) 2   the IKEA coffee table (I know 'cause I bought mine there) I was eating off of was wobbly spilling my coffee all over the place 3)  my coffee sucked 4)  and my food really sucked -- I had the "Switch [eggs] Benedict", the hollandaise sauce sucked and the egg was over cooked and cold.  That said, the place is absolutely BEAUTIFUL, they played trendy electronica in the background, supplied free Wi-Fi and served liquor.  ****************  Okay second experience ... I go back a second time to play on my MacBook and have a few drinks on the patio on a wonderfully great day.  All is good until out of nowhere the waiter drops by my bill.   Am I being shuttered out?  Is his shift over?  If so, no biggie, I've worked in a bar and am more than willing to tip out but I'd still like to stay and please tell me if that's that case!  Grrrrr!  Well at least the brunette waitress (not mine) is cute. LOL  *************

This place needs a sixth star.  The most romantic place for breakfast in all of Phoenix ... outdoor and indoor dining ... it's self seating ... but before you select your table you place your order on the supplied clipboards ... you then you turn them in and pay and they give you a number to place on your table.  A waitress supplies water and your drinks ... but you serve yourself coffee (all of which works out PERFECTLY).  Bar none this the (new) best breakfast place in town ...   I had the pancakes which were out of this world.    We sat outside with a picturesque view of downtown all while a guitar player played ... just AMAZING ...   Yet again another incredible independent business playing a huge roll in the amazing resurrection of Downtown Phoenix.  Go here ... seriously ... you WILL thank me (no need, really)!

Not a horrible music venue ... it just seems like they don't try very hard.  The venue seem to depend on outside promoters (like Charlie of StateSide Presents) to put on decent shows.  The worst of it is that the "ankle biters" get to go right up to the stage while the profit generating drinkers are relegated to the back with poor sight lines.  F' that!!  This town needs a new Nita's Hideaway ... and sadly this aint it.

Unreal! I've never found a truly trustworthy mechanic in my life, but I have now.   I brought my car in for a tune-up and Bogi (the owner) said "well everyone has a different idea of what a tune-up is, we will run some tests and let you know what we find." A couple of hours later Bogi calls me back and goes down a laundry list of items and tells me stuff like "well you could do [this and theat] but they aren't necessary as they look good at this point". CLEARLY she could have up sold me on any number of things, but she absolutely did not. I was/am absolutely STUNNED!  When I picked up my car there were those paper mats on my floor (something that my deal doesn't even do anymore) AND a metal water bottle with a $25 off on your next visit coupon attached. Talk about exceeding expectations!  Never mind the awesomeness of supporting a woman owned business, you also can trust her/them. "Ummm ... WINNING!"

So when a friend told me that D&B was a bar with a full arcade, my immediate reaction was "What!?  Seriously!?  When are we are going to go!?!?" and I guess I should have known from her luke warm reaction (which was a look that said "ahhh YOU can go anytime YOU want") that it sounded much better on paper than in reality.  The first time I entered the door the overwhelming sports theme was so obnoxious that I just couldn't handle it and I turned around and left.  Last night my (beautiful) date was up for bar food and this was our only option.  And what do you know?  First impressions do matter! And sometimes you CAN judge a book by it's cover.  I had a $20 steak which was tough, fatty and included NO FRIES/POTATOES and NO SALAD!  Not exactly a great value.  Plus it sucked ass.  That said, I've got to say, my favorite part of the experience was, that even though this place is a huge cheesy sports bar full of harmless bright shinny suburban clones ... for some reason, management feels the need to have, not one, not two, not three but FOUR fat bouncers to greet you at the door.  A very scary place indeed!  **  FYI, if your the type that likes the genre of big shinny sports an/ or dance bars ... you really need to discount this, and all of my Yelps!  Clearly this place is popular (or it wouldn't be a corporate chain).

$$$$$ Hard Liquor & Hard Beats DOWNTOWN Phoenix! $$$$  BRING YOUR CREDIT CARDS!  An outdoor bar/dance club in front of the building next door to Fate (situated right off Roosevelt Row in The Evans-Churchill District) ... Nightly DJs ... and outdoor drinking (and dancing (?)) with a PERFECT view of the ever improving downtown skyline.    Sadly they have NO "shelf/house" liquor selections so drink prices are pretty Damn HIGH ... I mean WAAAY high ... $11 for the cheapest rum & coke!  This is YET AGAIN another business venture making another huge improvement in the Downtown Art District ... HOWEVER, sadly the drink prices are just to high for this place to become much of a regular hang-out.

Unquestionably the biggest Yelp let down ever!  I had a pepperoni pizza and it was just plain flavorless. The pepperoni and sauce was the delicious flavor of a good old water. Yum! (not).  I've never been so disappointed in a well reviewed Yelp establishment ever! Let's hope this is the first and last time!  (you'd be MUCH better served by Cibo, Pizza A Metro or Spinatos ... all within the vicinity)

An art gallery, a clothing store, a learning center, and coffee shop.  GOOD coffee!!  They list themselves as:  Fashion. Art. Politics & Coffee.  The outside appears to be a house but don't let that fool you ... inside it's all shopping (with a back room for classes).   The people are great and sell locally made stuff (mostly clothing).  All this and it's on what the New Times (urgh) says is the hippest block in the city (which just so happens to be MY street!).  Oh yeah ... this from the people who started Co-Lab. They currently offer classes in paper making, knitting, and felting.   Their funky hours are:  7:30am to 1:30pm, Mon-Sat and 6-10pm, Tues-Sat  If they had a sound system inside and out on the patio would be nice (they only have a sad little boombox now) and and some Wi-Fi they'd easily get 5 stars ... maybe in time ... (note ... I've been told that the Internet is in ... they just need to setup the router)

Ahhh, breakfast my favorite meal!  Over Easy is way cool, and by all accounts it's Matt's Big Breakfast's latest challenger for best breakfast in town.  And the winner ... Over Easy by a nose.  I've been twice now, and both times I've had the waffle and hash browns.  Unfortunately the maple syrup is nowhere near as good as Matt's or Palette (the best syrup in town) but still pretty good.  But what really makes this place better than Matt's is that they really do CARE about you while you wait (what a concept).  So yes, there are outside seats for people waiting and that's a big deal to me.

Are you Fucking kidding me!  You did NOT leave a disconnect notice on my fence for a non payment of $49.57.  Hold it, let me check that again.  Oh yes you did!  For a mere $49.50 are you kidding me!?  You Mother Fuckers!  I Fucking hate you!  I'm sorry I didn't get your Damn bill ... I practiclly never pickup my mail because all my bills BUT yours are auto paid.  My mailbox is nothing but a heaping pile of junk mail and your F'n bill.

I have no doubt you'd sell it to some spammer in Burma for a penny!  And no I am not calling your B.S. payment line in India and then call you back with my payment confrimation number!  You can go to Hell!  You'll get your damn $49.57 when Wells Fargo get it to you, you bastards!    And if it weren't for Yelp! I'd proabaly go off the Damn grid just to spite you Fuckers!

Warning: Douche Bag level CODE RED!  Here's how my experience went ...   Me: "May I have a Carmel Latte?"  Employee: "No" .... dead air ... Me: "Ummm why not?" Employee: "We don't have carmel" Me: "Ummm I guess I'll just have a Cappuccino then" Employee: "Just so you know it's a REAL Cappuccino" Me: "Okay" (in my head I'm trying to figure out if I can legally punch this dickhead in the face or not).  So I sat down mulling over this experience in the dank dark atmosphere while listening to this ass wipe talk to his friend about living on other peoples couches for the past few months and about how he'll be moving to downtown Phoenix soon. To which I just chuckled to myself as this person was FAR from cool enough to blend into CenPho. What a complete and utter douche bag. Stay in Tempe poser (and keep your employer there to!).  This experience was months ago, and now they have opened up a shop downtown. Guess what? I'm not going to check them out. Fuck you Cartel. You'll never be Lux, so just stay in Tempe where you can be a complete poser with an attitude that you haven't earned.  Complete FAIL.   For my two cents, skip this place and go to Lux in CenPho/Mid Town right off the Light Rail. Authentically cool with ZERO attitude, great coffee and no douche bag employees.   And as for great coffee ... try Conspire WAY better coffee and authenticly cool.  ----  please read "owners comment" below ... here's my response ...  ---- Wow so the coffee snobbery continues with the owner ... I guess my new job  should be to "promote good coffee in Arizona" ... and I don't appreciate good coffee because I enjoy the combination of caramel AND coffee ...   By that definition I guess I don't know good ice cream because I like hot fudge on it or good pizza because I enjoy pepperoni AND cheese or good music if it's not acoustic or a good voice unless it's A cappella ... thanks for proving my point. I wouldn't go here unless you are a total coffee snob ... (I guess) they don't need your business you poser!

The first time I went it was on a Friday evening.  The small place was filled but they only had one waitstaff on duty and it took us an hour and 15mins to get food.  That TOTALLY sucked!  Yesterday went back and the place was empty and we were served immediately.  The first time I ordered the Jerk Chicken and it was barely seasoned.  Yesterday we ordered the Jerk Shrimp and the Jerk sauce was HOT and tasty but the shrimp was over cooked.  The sticks of bread are AWESOME (and kinda sweet) and so are the sodas that they serve (they are Jamaican and made with real sugar cane)!   I'll be back but I had much higher hopes.

Thank GOD for Mamma Mia's new CenPho location!  Sure living downtown we DO have the two best pizzaria's in town (Cibo and Bianco's) but neither of them deliver.  Leaving us (for the most part) stuck with the chains.  There are a few indie pizzeria's but none of them very good (IMHO) but finally Tony's Mamma Mia Pizza and Subs has filled that void.  Not the best pizza but (IMHO) just the best pizza that you can get delivered to you door in CenPho.  The Crust is just right, the sauce pretty good and the pepperoni nice and spicy.  Parking lot is in the back.    Lunch specials (two slices and a soda) for under $5 (blowing away Z Pizza in the bargain lunch category).

Barack Obama ate here!  That's right BITCH, the next Pressy had a burger here.  This from the owners mouth.  At any rate, man did I want to LOVE this place, unfortunately my burger was over cooked.  The seasoning was great so I think it was just my bad luck.  I will go back.  But here's the real reason to eat here, it's Fucking CHEAP!  $5 get's you a burger, fries and a coke!  You can't beat that!

*They are moving to the old HoodRide location soon!* Which will be a FULL coffee house with outdoor and indoor seating!  The owner John couldn't be nicer ... the coffee just rawks (it has a very full earthy flavor) ... He buys from Cartel Coffee but instead of telling customers what THEY want (as Cartel does) John makes it how YOU want it without the Douchebag "WE know REAL coffee and you don't" attitude.

GREAT place ... great food.  That atmosphere is sooooo nice ... coffee's great and free wi-fi!  Seems like the owner and his wife are always there and they want you to enjoy your experience.   The outdoor patio is facing 7th Street so regretfully it's like sit along side a freeway.  Also they only have 7 parking spots in their very small lot.  But still a really nice addition to downtown.

Fucking GREAT pizza!  This place rivals Cibo for my favorite pizza in town.  I had a cheese and peperoni pie.  The peperoni was spicy but not over riding so. That sauce was very fruity, the crust perfectly crispy yet soft and flexible.   Wow.  The restaurant is very small and tucked into a dirty little strip mall but the inside is nice.    If you love pizza I think you'll LOVE this place.  YUM!

This is not Frys or Basha's and in my world that alone gets this place four stars.    I'm not sure what this store is trying to be, it's either a large convenience store or a mini grocery store, either way it's not your traditional American store.  I bought a steak here (good), ground beef (looked good, but that Grey meat was in the middle), and a French Silk pie (out of this world GREAT!!!)  Get the French Silk pie!!!  Anyway, this place is pretty cool ... the more options, the better!  And by the way, they are trying to encourage hybrid use by supplying a special parking spot for them, Derrrr!  And I think it's super nice to have a private corporation encourage conservation of energy!

Well after seeing "Paul's" glowing review of a place that hadn't even opened yet, I really feel like panning the place.   I guess I'll refrain and give you my straight up review.  But first a note to "Paul" your a ass clown douchebag. And noting that "Paul" has never reviewed any other place clearly "Paul" is aligned with the owners which is INCREDIBLY SAD and LAME!!!!  Here goes:  The interior is absolutely beautiful and a welcome change from it's past occupant (The Willow House). My Latte was quite tasty but unfortunately also VERY weak. I was there on the first day of their "soft opening" and they had yet to install a wi-fi access point (kinda a major thing for a coffee shop in my opinion). I was told that they will supply free wif-fi with a purchase, but that had yet to be setup.  The art on the walls was from local artists which I totally appreciate. The seating was varied in style and they had a comfy couch. I'd give this place another star if it weren't for the obvious attempt at gaming the Yelp system.

Beware of the overzealous sales staff! I came in and got a whole lot of help in getting a properly fitted helmet. The guy seemed really knowledgeable and he walked me through getting a perfect fit.  Unfortunately his knowledge did not carry over into my next inquisition, (but his vibrato did) helmet audio. I asked about bluetooth in helmet speaker systems and he said that they did not carry any (which I thought was odd for a helmet store)! However he did have some "really great" speakers that I could install. He had two models and he told me that the higher priced models were just that much better. I took the bait and asked if he'd install them. Obviously he had never done this before and it became equally clear that he really didn't really have any experience with them at all.  Well the speakers HAVE TO HAVE AN AMPLIFIER! There is no way you can hear much of anything without amplification. Anyone who had any knowledge or any experience with these would have known this. This guy clearly didn't know what he was selling (but that sure didn't slow him down from trying to sell them)!. So I went back to return them and I was told that they were "electronics" so therefore were not returnable.  So if the ONLY thing you want is a helmet ... not a bad place. If you want advise on anything else ... perhaps this is not the best place for inquiring.

There are good business owners and there are bad ones. The owner of this place is one of those really good ones.   After my original review the owner wrote me and offered to take back my electronics purchase even though it was not their police to do so. And the best part was that he explained himself in a very not confrontational manner. He knew the employee, explained that he was new(er) and that having thousands of items (and they do!) that it's difficult for new people to know each and everything. I completely agree.  So with that in mind I am TOTALLY revising my review. The sales staff assisting me was AMAZINGLY helpful in picking out the proper fit/helmet for me. I HIGHLY recommend you (at the very least) buy your first helmet HERE ... the learning experience is bar none.  And one more thing ... one of the first things my salesman asked me was "how much are you willing to spend?". And that one always get's my dander up as what almost always happens after that question is "the up sell" ... NOT here. I told him I wanted to spend around $100-200 ... and he took me right to some than he liked that were in the low $100 range. That means a lot to me ... the guy was clearly a pretty honest and good dude!

Don't let the name fool you. This is "real" Mexican food. The owner IS from Mexico but her name just happens to be "America", cool huh? Typically this isn't my style of fare, but I DID enjoy my beef taco with just meat and cheese.  The restaurant is in a beautifully restored historic house (as is typical of new CenPho venues). They have a little outdoor patio over looking 7th Street which was way cool.  One thing that I think should be stressed is that this aint cheap. They sell bottles of Mexican Coke for $2.50, the tacos were like $2.25 each, and chips and salsa were an extra charge.  Still yet another great addition to CenPho!

Sadly Z Pizza is currently the best slice in downtown. It's "just fine" pizza and they have reasonably priced daily slice specials.  Take note: This place gets some serious lines during the weekday lunch periods (proof enough these are the best slices in the vicinity).

I wish I could LOVE this place, but I don't. It's not a lounge, it's not a nightclub and it's barely a restaurant (the menu is sparse).   The Venue: It's situated right downtown and sadly most of these venues have to survive off the "downtown tourists" from the suburbs. My guess is that this place is aimed to give those (middle aged) people a sense of "the big city" and that it does. It strives to have a mature hip feel, the dinning room employs the newly popular community seating (i.e. you could find yourself sharing a bench/table with the couple right next to you), and they have a DJ playing trance music while you dine. They succeed in that regard. This does have an old skewl slightly upscale "metro" feel to it.  The Food:  A very sparse menu, I had the carne pizza which had GREAT thin crust but lacked much flavor.  The service: The service staff is where they REALLY fail. You can go to places like FEZ, Cibo, or Pallete and it's instantaneously clear that you are being served by PROFESSIONALS. Not so much here, quite the opposite actually. Our service was what I expect from a breakfast dinner or The Waffle House (the waitress was FAR to casual for a place like this, i.e. it was kinda a like "so watcha want?" kinda thing going on). And honestly, with the current unemployment rate, as well as the location and style of this place, it's completely unacceptable to me.  So if your looking for poor service in Downtown now you have three choices: Carly's, Breadfruit and now Hanny's  All-in-all ... I'd say that this place is yet another venue that regretfully caters to the occasional downtown tourist and adds very little to the sustainability of a REAL downtown (that Phoenix so lacks). It gets a "meh".

Yoser! A Laundromat with free WiFi! I mean how freakin' cool is that!?  The place is well maintained and has PLENTY of machines ...   The only issue I have with this place is that it's "coinless" meaning you will need to buy a card to use any machine. That being that, you will inevitably leave with a card that has money left on it, and the prices are not cheap.

Are you kidding me!?   I can't think of anything critical to say about this place. Oh wait, of course I can! Every time I asked my server to refill my empty glass (the one that he was taking off our table) well, he looked at me like I was putting him out. I mean WTF? Since when does a bar staff member take a glass from a bar table and NOT ask if you wanted another one? NOT cool dude!  But other than that ... this place is Damn near perfect. It's hip and cool and does so without appearing to try too hard. It's comfortable, it's dark, the music level was just about right. A full bar. A view of the city. Comfy seats and couches. I couldn't ask for anything more (well, other than a stage booked by Charlie of StateSide Presents).  Big UPs to The Side Bar!!!

Full menu with standard bar fare, kitchen open late and Downtown. 'Nuff said! Everything I've wanted is now complete. CenPho is complete IMHO. They even have breakfast on the weekends!  The fish and chips is straight outta Seamus' kitchen (i.e. it's Fucking fantastic).

God I so wish I liked this place. The inside is super clean, it's right off the Light Rail and Minority owned.  We went for Breakfast and I had scrambled eggs, Sausage, hash browns and pancakes. The pancakes were just okay, the menu said "maple syrup" and it totally wasn't real). The sausage was red and I didn't like it. The hash browns were not pre-soaked, tough and not good in the least bit.  Even Denny's is better than this.   Bummer.

I hate saying this about any venue that opens in CenPho but this experience was just HORRIBLE!  Now granted this was the first day of their soft open but the food prepared by the self professed "Celebrity Chef" was not good ... not even a little.  We had two tapas ... the first was the potatoes where were mini and most of them were undercooked and hard. They were not good.  We also had Lobster Cakes were were had an extremely intense taste (that I didn't like) and that taste completely drowned out the Lobster. One of the cakes was even cold in the middle.  I also had a steak that was under cooked and in no way a great piece of meat (chewy and a strong line of tough fat running through the entire piece).   The place is EXTREMELY small and because of that the tables are WAY to close together ... and nearly impossible to navigate without bumping into the people next to you.  I'm just sooooo sad that this place was a fail for us.

Ginger is freakin' amazing!  Before my first cut she sat me down to have a talk. Like a serious talk, about my hair. It was a bit overwhelming but equally much appreciated. She's seriously a pro.  Side Note: Usually I'd subtract a good three for four stars for anyone who lives in Scottsdale. But she seems pretty cool, so I'm giving her a pass.

The nicest people EVER, and the place is absolutely gorgeous!   Not only is the money spent here kept in the state, it's kept in the neighborhood (the owners live only blocks away in the heart of CenPho). The entire place is self constructed of the blood, sweat, and tears of the owners (a Husband and Wife team), and they have great design sense.  As for the class, here's the deal ... I know nothing about Yoga, and this was my first Yoga class. It kicked my slacker ass, but I felt all the better for it. The cute as hell instructor could not have been a nicer person (I'm seeing a pattern here). She instructed the class in a relaxing yet deliberate and concise manner.  Just a top notch business all around. Did I mention that the owners were out of the world nice, cool and down to earth people? Well it can't be said enough ...   Thank you SuTRA!  -----  note -----  Yes SuTRA helped us with a benefit for our PODCAST (not me personally, and something they did not have to do) ... and their help had NOTHING to do with my review (outside of getting to know what wonderful people they are). So there's your "full Disclosure".  Perhaps Tyler may want to disclose HIS conflict of interest in his posts. For about a year now he's been publicly dissing our Podcast (all this while working for a competing web site).   I just feel really sorry for him.

Well they have re-upped the outside bar, added a "corn hole" area (I can't believe people call it that) and it's super super nice, and has a great view of the CenPho skyline.  This morning I had the Coke Ham and white cheddar omelet ... the toast that came with it was out of this world and the ham was Damn good. And they served my dawgie water right away ... big ups!

I'd say about 80-90% of the candy is readily available at your local Circle K ... so I'm not sure I really get what's going on here ...   Let's hope they get more hard to find jems in the future ...

Honest to God, Sheriff Joe's jail is more comforting than this venue (trust me, and don't ask why, but I know). So here's to hoping that they just opened earlier than they had wanted to, 'cause right now this maybe the coldest coffee shop I've been in since Drip. Or maybe they just don't want you hanging around, and if that's the case they certainly have succeeded with flying colors.   As at this point in time (1st week) they have ONE comfortable piece of furniture and all the rest are bare metal chairs.   The space certainly does have potential with their big outdoor patio. And by the looks of it they will have a hot kitchen sometime in the future.   As for the coffee, it's okay but nothing special, and/but don't expect any orange flavor for your Italian soda 'cause they don't seem to think it's worthy of stocking (at either stores).  Unfortunately Lux still has no competition in this town ...

So yeah, you pick a bowl of 3 eggs and you fill it with six toppings of your choosing.   You can also get sides by themselves like waffles, pancakes etc., ...  I got a bowl of scrambled eggs with, sausage, two kinds of cheese, bacon and stuff, it was good and more than I could finish.   Jacqui had a waffle with Maple Syrup and they rawked! All super fresh and cheap ...

The Pools have now opened up their third business within walking distance of my house. With the Pools you expect the best, and again of course they came through with another jewel. The space is just amazing and beautifully and uniquely decorated (pretty sure nothing here came from IKEA).  The entire South wall is setup for laptops (which IMHO is one of the most important things that lesser coffee shops often forget).  I had a Honey Vanilla Latte and it was smooth as silk. I can't wait to make this my new work space (provided the owners allow me to support them which is another story altogether).

I love Dive Bars.  I love Rock Clubs.  So I had high hopes for Rips, but sadly this place fails at both.  This venue has the distinct feel of an owner who's patrons have moved on (or died) and this whole "Rock Bar" thing is just a desperate and finial grasp at survival.  The staff are all middle aged and clearly could give two shits about the local music scene. Therefore there's absolutely nothing organically cool about this place.   And with The Crescent Ballroom, The Valley Bar and Rebel Lounge all in the nearby vicinity, I see no reason for this place's existance. Granted, those venues are significantly more Rock than Dive Bar, so if you're looking for a good combo of both, The Rogue would be a significantly better choice IMHO.

Just about everything that makes a coffee shop good is lacking here.  1) uncomfortable chairs (what the HELL!? Sure they look "cool" but they are really really are uncomfortable) 2) roasting beans inside which just REEKS 3) lack of a decent number of outlets for laptops  And for the coffee ... just middle of the road ...

Lola's Coffee is better than Fair Trade Coffee (4 blocks away). Other than that, it's just a coffee shop, nothing more, nothing less.   One couch, two comfy chairs a table and the rest are rather ridged metal chairs. The high ceiling gives the place a airy if not vacant feel.   They do have lots of space for laptops and lots of outlets to go with.  The coffee is ... well ... it's coffee. Nothing outstanding nothing horrible, but it doesn't come anywhere near the awesomeness of Lux or Conspire.   The the biggest complaint I have is they only have ONE set of stereo speakers so the music comes from one area of the room and just bounces around the single room venue.

It tastes just like home (Wisconsin)!   Butter burgers, custard, cheese curds and Walleye fish dinners ... ding, ding, ding, ding!  All in a fast food restaurant that can't be beat IMHO (narrowly beating on In & Out Burger).  Some complained about the service but I've had nothing but TOP NOTCH service here. The last time I was here a girl came around offering free custard samples and another staffer came around asking if everything was okay (try to get that service in any other fast food restaurant!).  And full disclosure ... I'm from Wisconsin which is where this franchise orginated so I maybe a little biased ...

Locker Room sucks ass The locker room is WAY too small ... they have a whopping two benches that comfortably sit 4 each, so a whole 8 people fit in the entire room at any given time. The rest of the locker room is wasted by "premium" lockers that virtually NO ONE uses. Then there's the very awkward positioning of chairs where people can hang out and lounge in the locker room while you are changing in front of them. And although there's signs that say "no cell phone use" in the locker room, the people in those chairs usually have their phones out with backside cameras facing YOU.  Undependable shower water temperatures. This places has gone weeks without hot water in the showers, and it's always hit and miss. It's been over 3 months and they can't seem to get it right.  Machines in various states of disrepair. This place is brand new and still there are numerous machines in  various states of "broken-ness". It's just amazing to me that these machines are left broken for months on end. Do they ever use their own equipment?  "Opps for got to tell you" So while getting the sales tour we were shown the tanning bed, of which the salesman just forgot to tell us that it was an extra charge. After telling management about this scam, the response was "sorry".  One decent thing is that they supply razors, q-tips, antiperspirant, bodywash, cream rinse and shampoo in the locker room/showers.  I wish I had gone back to the YMCA rather than get locked into a 2 year deal with this poorly managed gym. The Y does not have any long term contracts and they have a pool, racquetball courts, basketball courts (of which Gold's has none) along with two workout rooms and all cheaper and without a long contract ...

I so wanted to fall in love with Centurion, unfortunately based upon this one visit for breakfast I just didn't feel it.   The place itself is cute and quaint with a couple of really nice couches and tables outside on the patio.  I had the Eggs Benedict and it was just okay. Granted Eggs Benedict is an extremely difficult item to produce so I'm not sure this one dish should be taken as a blanket review. But it was pretty bland and it was loaded with some green leafy things (not found on your typical EB) that I scraped off.  I'll be going back and making revisions as needed ...

Ever wanted to go to Lambeau Field to watch a Green Bay Packer game but didn't want to freeze your ass off?  Well here ya' go!  EVERY Sunday (during the Packer season) this place is wall-to-wall Packer fans, 95% of them from Wisconsin.  Every wall is plastered with Packer memorabilia.  On every Packer score the place ERUPTS into complete mayhem!!!  Even the menu (and owner) is from Wisconsin.  Perch (it's a fish people) sandwiches, brats, Wisconsin cheese curds ... everything!    They also sell just about anything that you can get a Packer logo onto!  I sh*t you not!  T-shirts, baby clothes, hats, sweaters and, yes those obnoxious cheeseheads to!  You name it they've got it in the Green & Gold with a big G on it!  Now for the bad news ... you MUST get there AT LEAST an hour prior to game time if you want a seat.  I'd never hang out here, outside of a Packer game ... but there's no place better to watch the Packers in the entire state of AZ.    Welcome to Green Bay, Arizona!    And Go Pack Go!

The place is simply beautiful. The venue spans two buildings. The North building is Bliss (restaurant) and to the south is ReBar (the bar). You can go back and froth between the two venues (with your drinks in hand). And you can't beat the view of Downtown from their circular bar that is outside. There is also a beautiful full bar in the building to the South.    We were served some samples of the Coconut Chicken and Sausage Ravioli and they were freakin great (at the "VIP" pre-view event we got invited to). But I can't speak to anything else on the menu.  The menu looks Damn good. And although the prices aren't cheap they do look fairly reasonable. Certainly better then what was here previously (FATE). The drink prices also seem reasonable ($4 for bottled beer and $5 for most draft).  The hamburgers buns are made of pretzel dough and they also have Mac & Cheese (with Chicken and Bacon) both of which I'm dying to try.  And the best of all, the place is 3 blocks from our house so I'm very excited to try the full menu.

Awesome burgers and HUGE portions. The fries were not "all that" and I sure do wish they served shakes/malts. And the WORSE part is that they don't validate your parking garage ticket (which is directly below the venue). Hell even CVS validates tickets (after you buy a .50 cent candy bar or something).  All of that aside the burgers are top shelf (and full of calories).

I'm not shitting you, this wasTHEEEE best breakfast I've ever had!  The pancakes are OUT OF THIS WORLD and the coffee is great.  I had the Eggs Benedict which was really good, due in most part to the really tasty ham.   Unfortunately I did not order any pancakes but kept stealing bites from my girl's plate. Without question the best pancakes I've ever tasted.  I can not wait to go back!

This is a preview review. I just so happened to walked by 2 hours after JoBot opened. The building itself has gone through a complete overhaul (since HoodRide vacated) and it's beautiful. There is a big looong bar lined  with bar stools so you can "belly up" while you wait for your drinks. There will be an entire room built later but for now the stools work just fine.  There was wi-fi but no stereo (which I presume will be installed soon enough). Equally so far (there is another room yet to open) it's not all that laptop friendly (few outlets).  JoBot is owned/run by John who owned/ran Conspire Coffee just down the street so it's the same great coffee.

I had previously edited this review due to the building owner (not the business owner mind you) being very pet UNfriendly and not allowing dog on the property/patio. I guess the business owner has come to an agreement with the building owner ... not sure what that is but, the place does deserve a 5 star not withstanding.

A TON of candy ... nicely displayed. A little pricey but it's a specialty store in an internet age.

Holy AWESOME! We had the pretzel fondue appetizer which was KILLER! I had the fish & chips and that was great to! They serve local micro brew beer from Sun Up  Brewery (I had the Light Rail Ale, of which, I was not a fan of).  The interior is beautiful and has a very open feel (high ceilings). There's really no way to describe it, but it appears that this place has a few themes that all work together just fine.  They have outdoor sidewalk dinning!  Now for the bad side ... it aint cheap. My girl and I had an app, two entrées and one drink each and our bill was $80.   This place has the best location in CityScape and I have little doubt that this new Fox creation will THRIVE here. Yea!!!

Is it a lounge? Is it a theater? Nope it's both, and it rocks at BOTH!  It does have a bit of the "ok, what now?" atmosphere (as previously stated) when you enter but after that is super chill. The lounge area itself is a nice wide open space where groups can very comfortably congregate.  We went to a movie and sat in the back (with bar level table seating) and the staff came by three times offering bar service (very cool!).  The theater has 4 or 5 theater rows and 4 or 5 bar level tables and chairs in the back. In a small space they've really produced a good movie theater feel! Nice job!  I wish they had hard liquor as this would be a great way to delineate it from the other nearby establishments (especially since it has the best chill atmosphere in the area).   I hope this place takes off 'cause it's super cool.

A great alternative to the punks over at Cartel Coffee. At One Coffee they don't pretend to know what is best for you and they will make your coffee to order (how original!). The place forgoes the "look how trendy ass kissin' this place looks" and instead go for familiarity and comfort.   It's actually very Starbuck-esque inside.   The coffee itself is smooth as a baby's ass ... not in the least bitter or tart.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE Mood Swings!  I've been going here for years and I've never had a bad experience.  And I can not say enough about my current "stylist" Abrelle (sp) ... she's F'n GREAT!  And get this!  You'll never believe it, but when I get my hair cut ... she puts 100% of her concentration into cutting my fucking hair!  Novel I know!    I mean, I never have understood why people think that their hairstylist should be interested in their mundane personal lives, and I absolutely hate small talk.  Abrelle fuckin' rawks.  She says "Hi, what are we doing today" and then cuts my hair and gives me the most wickedly great massages (scalp and hand, she used to start with a neck massage to but some how that's been lost, but you know what?  That's not her job so, so be it.), but I'd pay the $40 just for the awesome scalp and hand massages she gives.  Oh yeah ... she also cuts hair like a champ!  Abrelle FTW!

I've now shopped here twice. Twice now I've walked around this place trying aimlessly to find something worth buying. It's futile for me.   Now we have two "specialty" marts in downtown (the Phoenix Public Market being the other) that do nothing to add the the sustainability of CenPho. Sucks to be us. We really need a full service store.   Come on Fresh & Easy! The market is ready and waiting!

So ya' want: Food. Beer. Boobs and Sports huh? Like most who try to "do it all", this place excels at NONE.  If you want great food go to Cibo. If you want great beer go to the Roosevelt Tavern or Lost Leaf. If you want great boobs go to the Hi Liter. If you want great sports go to Coach & Willies.  (all of those are within a few blocks of this place)  If you want all of 'em in one great spot ... good luck to ya' champ.

This is the new mecca of Phoenix music.   Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nita's Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... that's just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman.   The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!  Thank you Charlie!  Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!  btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment).

CityScape just keeps getting better and better by the week!   Sure it's a complete knock off of Mojo Yogurt ... but it's HERE and that's all that matters. And it's tasty.  Even the interior even takes a page from Mojo (with an ultra modern look and feel).

Although you may think different ... this place is NOT FAST FOOD. They are located in the center of the 6th largest city and they have exactly ONE cash register. And not only that, the staff move as if they are mentally challenged and have an IQ of 60.  The food is typical Church's but ya' might want to plan ahead and make sure you have plenty of extra free time ...

I have no idea what the owner's problem is, but he's incredibly rude. His wife, on the other hand is super nice (an odd mix).  Great space, rude owner and the coffee is average.

A dozen or more food trucks, shade, music with a beatiful view of downtown. What's not to LOVE!?! Can't find something you like? The Market Cafe (in the same parking lot) is terrific.

OMG! This is not a locally owned venue!?! How could any self respecting person patronize such a place!?! Well, as it turns out, it's probably just for people whom enjoy good hamburgers more than the latest trend.  Yay! I'm a fan is right.

CenPho's latest is a BEAUTIFUL FULL-ON ALE HOUSE!  Just stopped by to check the place out and was flagged down by the nicest husband and wife team who invited me in!   The place is spectacular! A large spacey room and a huge outdoor patio with an incredible view of Downtown.  I'm from Milwaukee and this place sends me back to "the way things are supposed to be" ... it's beer, it's people ... it's HOME!  I can't wait to go back for more!  Oh yeah ... of course they have got a huge looooooooong wall of a gazillion beers on-tap!  Fantastic!!!

The rooms are GREAT (mine had a picture of  the Great Jim Morrison) ... and the casino is still the "hippest" place for the younger crowd (sorry Palms).  They play middle-of-the road over-commercialized "rock" music over the PA, which sadly, still ranks better than the rest of the casinos.  Is it a cool place?  NO!  Is it the best casino to hang out in Las Vegas? ... I think so.

From GREAT to REALLY BAD in three quick visits.  2nd Visit:  Last week I ordered the Egg Benedict and the english muffin was ROCK HARD. Like "chip your tooth" hard. How this got put on a plate is beyond me! Completely in-edible. The service was soo bad I never had the chance to talk to a server, I just paid and left.  3rd Visit:  But that English Muffin was nothing compared to yesterday morning's breakfast sandwich which was tasty as all get out ... only one problem.   I SERIOUSLY NEARLY DIED AFTER EATING IT!! I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS SICK IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!   I've never had food poisoning ... Hell, I'd never gotten sick from eating anything, anywhere. But yesterday I woke up, got dressed and walked to Scratch (I did nothing else). By the time I walked home I was doubled over in SEVERE pain. I laid in bed for the entire day. I really should have gone to the hospital, it was that bad. Instead I was writhing in pain for EIGHT HOURS until I started puking up that breakfast sandwich. Two hours of puking it up, I was "stable". Naturally this is typical, but it was my experience.  And now, all that I can think of is how lucky that couple was, whom after 20mins of being ignored by the staff, they just up and left without ordering (this is COMMON! THEY ARE DREADFULLY UNDERSTAFFED!!!!!). The servers are great ... just nowhere near enough of them! It's a complete fail! And it's been happening regularly ever since they opened a few weeks ago!   1st Vist:  Located on 5th Street and Roosevelt right smack dab in the middle of the Arts District.    Outdoor seating/patio with a great view of Downtown.  The dinning room has table and barstool seating with an ultra modern motif.  And I just had the best omelet in my life.  Not kidding. My drip coffee was hot, strong and smooth (I loved it).

For Bar Only:   Situated in the former "Canvas" location it's a perfect venue for outdoor drinking!   The staff appears to be family and/or professional servers ... Top notch service!

I love love love this place. Casual yet classy and one that speaks eloquently to the neighborhood. The patio bar is very very nice (when they don't have the supersonic air wall blasting) and they allow dogs!   For my dime, Cibo and this place are two of downtown's quintessential restaurants.

I've had two chicken sandwiches here, both chicken. The meat sits in a steam tray under foil, sitting under a heat lamp, and that seems weird to me. That said, I've have no complaints and at both my visits the meat was good.   The inside is very small with three tables.  They give you a dry sandwich on a bun, and you squirt which ever sauces you choose. I find the Hot BBQ sauce is a divine mix of hot, sweet and tangy.

Good locally sourced ice cream and delicious homemade cones.  Why don't they have malt to make shakes better? I'm not entirely sure. Even still, it's a pretty awesome little funky ice cream shop.

The best hot dog you'll ever have. The menu is always in flux. The pretzel hotdog is bonkers and the patio is perfect for people watching on the burgeoning Roosevlt Row. Indoor and outdoor seating. Small bar inside.

This review revolves solely around the selling of my vinyl records.  First, I walk in and the clerk just tells me to set me records down, she never takes my name, nothing. I go back to check on them 10 minutes later only to be asked "Oh, did anyone check you in?". Ummm ... nope!  Then I get checked in and proceeded to wait ANOTHER 46 minutes for them to price out less than 10 records!!! I mean seriously? WTF? And not only that, the offer was 1/3rd what was previously offered to me by Revolver Records. F' this place!

The pizza is "pretty good".  But what really makes this place:  1) the people (workers and patrons) 2) the atmosphere (they're usually playing some kickin' tunes over the REALLY poor sound-system).  3) owned by a local/downtowner and most of all ...  4) THE HOURS! It's the only after-hours pizza by-the-slice place in town (to my knowledge).  Next time you're "over-served" try to remember this place, you'll be happy you did.

I had a $3.50 steak taco and it was terrific!  Equally I have had the chicken taco and it was also fantastic.  Excellent patio with a nice view of Roosevelt Row with a great mix of fun tropical music.  Seriously, chips and salsa and a $3.50 taco, how can you beat that!?!? I love it.   Side Note: at the beginning they did have an issue with the chips not being crisp, that issue has since been resolved.

The best doughnuts in Phoenix bar none, and sadly it's a chain.  The special sauce? They make them FRESH right AFTER you order them. Why can't Short Leash and/or Welcome Chicken + Donuts make them fresh? I don't know but it kinda irritates me. Oh well, if you make a good product and I'm all over it. Sorry "Localists" you're never going to get to taste the best doughnut in Phoenix.

It's soooooo painful for me to not love anyone, and everyone, who opens up a place of business in my neighborhood. Luckily they are doing well so here it goes.   The interior was sparsely decorated and a bit barren (I was there on their first week so perhaps it's been improved) but the inside was not in the least bit "comforting".  I had a pepperoni pizza and shockingly it had slightly less flavor than Little Caesars. Perhaps this is exactly what "Authentic Italian" tastes like, I guess I wouldn't know. But for my choices: a few blocks south sits beautiful Cibo, and a bit north Central sits Pane Bianco, both of which serve exceptional pizza. EXCEPTIONAL!  But the owners here are Italians (and they speak to each other in Italian) so if you'd rather just hear a bunch of Italian words brandied about, and that makes you feel all "worldly" and "international" I suppose this would be your place. I'd rather just have a great meal in a beautiful/comfortable setting.  I hope they do well.

Yikes. Ummmm ... this coffee was not great. Specifically, I had a latte and it was watery tasting and what flavor it did have was "marginal at best".

This place is absolutely beautiful inside with a vast dog friendly patio outside.  Essentially it's a "food court" with higher end/local fare.  I've had a couple of burgers here and they were both pretty good. I'm not sure they were worth $10 bucks, but I'm a cheapskate.   Worthy to note, they are just getting started and haven't filled all of their slots. So I'm assuming this place will just keep getting better and better.

Unbelievably cool.  Part music venue, part bar and just an amazing place to hangout.  Before and after every Crescent Bar show (the same amazing owner), this is where you'll find me (and I imagine many others). Just epic. Epic I say!  Full Disclosure: I've known the owner for a couple of decades now (just from going to the shows that he's been putting on over these many years). You seriously couldn't meet a nicer, more humble guy in music production. His success is the result of being an honest and trustworthy music promoter, something rarely found in his industry.

The Mason Jar is BACK!  Okay, I'm definitely dating myself here, so here we go.  This is a nice intimate live music venue (with a history) that has been completely striped of it's old innards. Gone is the musty dankness of the former venue and it's been replaced with a really nice, clean and modern feel.  My favorite part of this venue has always been the looooooooong bar. Not only does this grant you drinks MUCH faster, but if you're by yourself, there's always a good chance that you'll find a decent place to "belly up" to the bar.  The sight lines are unimpeded and the sound system seems rock solid.  That said, I'm not real fond of the lack of seating.   ProTip #2: You enter through the side door which is behind a wall that obscures the entrance (it's always been like this). If you're a rookie, you'll certainly be perplexed, but don't worry about it, next time you'll appear like you're really "in the know".  Full Disclosure: I've known the owner (Stephen Chilton) for some years now. He's a super nice guy who's been booking shows in town for quite sometime. And I couldn't be happier that he now has his own venue.

I honestly don't know what they are trying to do here. It appears that they are trying to make the transition from Turf and make it into an upscale bar and I'm not sure it works. It's basically a nice bar with bar food fare.
