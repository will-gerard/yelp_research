Disappointing. They spend all their money on the major travelling exhibits (Body Worlds, Narnia), so the rest of the exhibits look a little old and uninspired.

I had been getting my hair cut at an expensive salon for years. I've been growing it out for the last year and finally decided to get a trim to clean up the ends. I bit the bullet and went to Great Clips, and I got the haircut I wanted for the cost of a tip at the previous place. Karla was great; she listened to what I wanted and made good conversation.  Tips:   - Check in online or on the Great Clips app. It'll let you know what the wait times are at locations near you and hold your place in line.  - Normally they just spray down your hair with a water bottle, but you can get a full shampoo and conditioner for just $3 more.  - Be clear and say exactly what you want. Bring a picture or say "I want one inch off" and show her where that is on your hair.  - The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that they don't blow dry your hair at the end. That means you have to go home and blow dry it yourself. It's also hard to judge whether you got the cut you wanted when your hair is still wet.

When the boyfriend and I get home after a long, tiring day and we just need to curl up with some comfort food, we invariably agree on chicken tikka masala from Flavors of India. It's the best, and the standard size feeds 2 easily with rice and naan. They used to give me a bit of a hard time for always getting the same thing, but they've let up. To be fair I've only gone there for takeout, but they always have cool Bollywood movies playing in the background.

You've got to go there for Saturday lunch. All glasses of wine are only $5. Their bruschetta is phenomenal. I recommend getting the pub board and asking for soft pretzels instead of the bread. The pretzels are freshly made and out of this world.

I am devoted to Hiedi Hand (a.k.a. Hot Hiedi). She's been cutting my hair for several months, ever since my previous stylist moved to D.C. She's so hilarious and outgoing--she tells it like it is. Plus she does a great job on the cut and is always sure I like it. If I'm iffy about the bangs, she'll redo them. She doesn't push me to buy the styling products at the salon. In short, love Hiedi.

This spa has set the standard by which all other spas are judged. So far no other spa has met that standard.  When you walk in, you are greeted and welcomed into the dressing rooms. A comfy robe and less comfy rubber sandals are waiting for you. Come an hour or so early so you can enjoy the hottub, sauna and relaxing waiting room. They usually have cucumber water, nuts, etc. out for nibbling. I've had massages and facials here, and both were amazing. The aesthetician was a little odd, telling me she wanted to paint my face because I looked Victorian, but other than that the facial was great.  Check out their website, because they have monthly deals. For example, buy a $100 gift card, get a $25 card free.  Tips: bring a swimsuit and ponytail holder, arrive at least an hour early

My husband and I got married at the Phoenix Art Museum last month. This is a review of the museum as a wedding venue.  The Phoenix Art Museum is a fabulous place to get married. You can have your ceremony in the courtyard, in the modern art gallery (which is what we did), in the front lobby, or on the front steps by the fountain. They have an enormous hall for the reception.  Pros:  - It has that modern, not-at-all Southwest feel that my husband and I were looking for. - They do a couple of weddings a year, so they know what they're doing, but they aren't simply a wedding factory. None of our guests had ever been to a wedding there, so it felt unique and special. - There are so many amazing locations for individual, couple, and group photos. - The event managers, Heather and Jackie, were great. They got back to me quickly when I had a question; they included my husband in the process; they were professional and friendly; they thought of the little details that helped everything flow seamlessly. - If you have your ceremony in the gallery, as we did, there's a big staircase for a dramatic entrance. - You can have your ceremony and reception in the same place, so your guests don't have to spend time traveling. - The guys' ready room is behind a secret sliding wall. My husband got a kick out of that.  Cons:  - It's $500 for the ceremony and $4,500 for the reception, so it's a little pricey. - You have to use their bartender, ARTenders, so you don't have much flexibility to keep alcohol costs down.  - You have to use one of their preferred caterers, but they have a long list. We went with Santa Barbara Catering, and they were fabulous. - The marble floor can get a little uncomfortable for dancing in heels. We put out a bunch of flip flops in a variety of colors and sizes (labeled "Sandals of Relief"), which were a big hit. - The ladies' ready room isn't that attractive for the getting ready photos. - When you're doing walk-throughs and meeting with vendors, you have to pay $10 admission, but they're free on Wednesdays.  Overall, we are so very happy we got married at the Phoenix Art Museum. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a unique, beautiful wedding location.

This place is great. The sandwiches, salads and soups are all yummy, but it's the macarons that keep me coming back for more. I've tried just about all the macaron flavors, and caramel is by far the best. It's so rich and indulgent; the cream filling is buttery, savory and sweet at the same time.  They can get very crowded, especially at lunchtime. You may have to wait for a table, and don't expect to have a quiet, intimate conversation.

We checked this place out because we had a groupon. You can also get discounted certificates for Fuego Bistro on restaurant.com, and they occasionally do offers through LunchClub.  This place has an extensive drinks menu. We got mixed drinks and loved them. I think mine was a flavored mojito, and his was something tropical. The Seared Ahi Tuna Mini Tostadas were OK, but the Angus GriIIed New York Strip Steak was an absolute showstopper.   As others have said, this place is hard to find. Look for Apollo's on the east side of 7th Street (giant lambda sign) and park in the lot just east of them.

I love how this theatre is close to everything, but you can always find a parking spot and the theatre is never crowded. I just wish they (and all other movie theatres) would show movies at 8pm instead of 7 and 9.

Love Nearly Naked. They do the crazy, off-kilter shows you won't find anywhere else. Saw Vampire Lesbians of Sodom, Scream Queens, Snake in Fridge, Saucy Jack and the Space Vixens, Rent, and Blood Brothers. The last one was the only disappointment. All others were engaging, entertaining and memorable. You can tell the actors are jazzed to be there, and the director is living his vision without compromise.

We wanted to like this place, we really did. But we were seated for 15 minutes when the owner came around and noticed that we didn't have any silverware. Only then did our server show up to take our drink orders. We sat and sat for an hour before our food came out (on a Tuesday night), and only then did we get any silverware. Our server never apologized for the ridiculously slow service. She never even acknowledged it, which makes me think that slow service is the standard. The veal parmigiana was delicious, but the lasagna was only so-so. It had big balls of sausage in it, which was rather odd.

A friend recommended Med Fresh's falafel, so I thought I'd give them a try. It was so yummy! Usually you get big falafel balls, so each bite is either all falafel or no falafel. Med Fresh spreads theirs out so there's an even falafel distribution. This is very important. (Is there a Yelp award for using the word "falafel" the most times in one review?)  I went there for lunch to escape the office. Some people feel awkward eating alone, but almost everyone there was enjoying lunch solo. The guy at the register talked me into a strawberry-banana smoothie, which was sweet and tasted fresh.

My husband and I got married in February. We had cake tastings at three locations (Bamboo Bakery, Cakes by Contessa, and Piece of Cake). Piece of Cake blew the others out of the water. Unlike the other two, Piece of Cake didn't make us wait when we had an appointment; they listened to what we wanted; they had delicious cake to try; the tasting was free; and they delivered on their promises.  Notes: - They're all the way out in Mesa, so it was a bit of a drive, but worth it. - They do tastings by appointment only. - Since your wedding cake won't be baked that morning, they have you taste cake that's a day old. That way they don't over-promise and under-deliver. The cake at the tasting and our wedding cake were both delicious and moist. - My husband designed the cake: three white cubes that form a spiral staircase on three glass cubes (see the photos). Piece of Cake got his vision and executed it flawlessly. Coordinating with them to drop off the glass cubes went smoothly. - According to my event coordinator, they were late in dropping off the cake, but it did arrive. Thankfully I was left out of the details. - Other reviewers have mentioned it, but instead of freezing the top tier of your cake and eating it on your first anniversary (kinda gross), they provide you with a freshly baked cake on your milestone anniversaries. From the contract: "We will recreate a 6" anniversary cake for your 1st, 5th, 10th, 25th and 50th wedding anniversaries absolutely free for all cake orders for 100 or more guests. To order your anniversary cake, simply call us 10 days prior to the day you would like to pick up your cake. Unfortunately we are unable to ship cakes."

We picked up our first-year anniversary cake and were pleasantly pleased to find not just a standard round or sheet cake, but an actual replica of the top tier of our cake. It was delicious and extra-special.

Love them! Please support your local yarn store instead of buying from the big box stores. *steps off of soapbox* This is a great store, and they just moved to 8100 E. Indian School Road, east of their previous location. They just got Malabrigo, which is a great value for a luscious yarn. I can't wait for their yarn tasting event 11/10!

Simply the best bridal boutique. The women there make you feel special, and they take care of you and your guests. They carry Allure, Sophia Tolli, Enzoani, and many other brands.  1. When you arrive, the consultant sits down with you to talk about your wedding and what you're looking for. She gives you 6 clothespins to pin to the dresses you want to try on. No carrying your own dresses (Azteca) or hoping the consultant remembers the dresses you want (Lillian Lottie).  2. The consultant gives you a strapless Spanx slip that sucks you in so you feel gorgeous and maintains your modesty. None of the other bridal salons I went to did this.  3. Nicole, my consultant and one of the owners, really got what I was looking for. She didn't mind my friends' and my often snarky remarks, and she chose dresses that showed she was listening to our critiques.  4. When I was in the fitting room, I heard one of the consultants ask my bridal party if they needed water or if the temperature of the room was comfortable. They really want to make it a positive experience.  5. When I found the dress, there was ABSOLUTELY NO PRESSURE to buy. I said I wanted to sleep on it since it's a big decision, and Nicole completely understood. The sample dress happened to be my size and color, and they offered it to me at a 20% discount even though it had just arrived a week or two earlier. It was a couple of hours before closing on Saturday, and they offered to put my dress aside so nobody else would try it on or even see it. That gave me the peace of mind knowing that I could take my time in making such a major decision.  Thank you, Uptown Bridal!

The dress I chose had a corset back, fabric that wrapped around to conceal the corset, and lots of snaps and hooks for the removable train. Months after I'd bought the dress, my salesperson was happy to show my mom and mother in law exactly how to lace up the dress and what order to do all the snaps. On our follow-up visit everyone was just as professional and kind as before.

This place is fabulous! I walked in and said, "Do you watch Mad Men? I need to be Joan." The owner responded, "I have the perfect Joan dress for you." She helped me find the perfect dress ($20), earrings ($6), brooch ($14) and gloves ($7) for the part.  The store looks like it used to be an old home. It's a bit crowded, but they have awesome vintage clothes, accessories and housewares. As you can see, the prices are extremely reasonable. Some may consider the owner overly chatty, but personally I appreciate shopping at small businesses with staff who are knowledgeable about what they sell and eager to talk about it.  This is now my go-to vintage store. Love it!

Simply put, the finest dining experience of my life. We were seated by the window, which had a beautiful wall of fire just outside it. The service was perfect--great timing, attentive without hovering, good suggestions. Everything was perfect, from the wine to the gnocchi. I wish I could afford to eat there more often.

SaBai offers your standard Thai fare in a former-Wendy's-made-hip atmosphere. I got the classic curry lunch special with tofu, crab wontons and Thai tea. Total: $18.  I asked for the curry medium, but it was a bit spicy for me. Yummy, lots of potatoes and carrots (unlike Thai Lahna). The crab wontons were fabulous, and the Thai tea was probably the best I've had.  When I told the waiter I liked the Thai tea, he recommended that next time I order it with lemonade instead of milk. He said it's like a Thai Arnold Palmer; they call it the Tiger Woods.

As many have said, their donuts are simply divine. I can also attest to their breakfast sandwiches. I've had the sausage, egg, and cheese on an English muffin and the bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant. Both were delectable. They also have excellent Thai iced tea with boba--some of the best in the valley!

I bought a groupon for Planet Hugger last month. After 2 calls and 7 e-mails back and forth, I was able to schedule them to clean my house this Saturday. Angela said she'd contact me closer to the date to let me know what time to expect them.  This Tuesday I hadn't heard from her, so I e-mailed for the time. No response. I called and left a message on Thursday, and their answering service assured me that they'd call back in 24 hours. No response. I called this morning and spoke to Anthony. When I told him about the lack of responsiveness, he didn't apologize or even acknowledge what I'd said. He just asked for my phone number. He said someone would call me back later with the time. He wouldn't transfer me to a manager, he wouldn't tell me when they'd be available, he wouldn't give me a direct number, he wouldn't even tell me when they'd call back.  I treat myself to a professional house cleaning once a year. I look forward to it all year. This company has me in tears.

You can get a 3-ounce taster of any of the beers on tap for $1 or $2 each. I went with a group of friends, and we tried ALL THE BEERS. It is a night that will live on in the annals of history. I highly recommend it as an adventure, a group bonding activity, and an opportunity to discover new beers you like.  The food is mighty tasty. I've had sweet potato fries at a lot of places, and these are hands-down the best. They're a little on the salty side, but that's how I like them. If only they offered them with Delux's aioli, then we'd be in business. We also got a meat & cheese plate and the grilled chicken flatbread pizza. They were both quite tasty and disappeared quickly.  Our server was great. We were a big group, and it would be easy to mess up with all of those tasters. But he got everything right and checked in with us regularly. It also didn't hurt that he was a cutey patootey.  The only con was that we were seated in an alcove with two booths, and it got really loud with all the sound bouncing around. I wish they'd put up a curtain between the booths and something on the walls to dampen the sound. For now, I'll just ask for a different table.

My husband and I love this place! It's great for a Saturday lunch (closed on Sundays).   We've tried most of their soups, but the mushroom bisque is absolutely the best. All other soups pale in comparison. It's delicious with an Asiago crouton.  The sandwiches we've tried are all good, but none of them truly stand out. That's the only reason why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5. The Mediterranean sandwich they're currently featuring is pretty yummy.  I love their soda fountain. They have a variety of flavored syrups, some of them sugar-free, to make your own Italian-style soda. I love Sprite with a bit of raspberry, strawberry, and/or blueberry.  With their you-pick-two meals you can get a half size soup, whole sandwich, and a chocolate covered strawberry. After a couple of trips the hubby and I figured out that one meal was plenty for the two of us. This makes it a very wallet-friendly eatery.

My hubby and I were spending the weekend at the Morongo Casino with a group of friends. The challenge: we each had $20 to spend on an outrageous outfit to wear for the weekend (inspired by the song, no doubt). I lamented that Cheap Thrills wasn't around anymore, because I knew Jeanne would help find the perfect outfit. Google sent me to Pearls, and I was thrilled to walk in and find Jeanne at the front counter! She helped me find the perfect Liz Taylor-inspired look, complete with martini glass loafers.  Just as Cheap Thrills used to be, Pearls is the perfect location for reasonably priced vintage clothes, jewelry, handbags, shoes, etc.

Got a chocolate chip cookie and brownie sandwich with coffee ice cream and Heath bar crumbles. Guys, it brought tears to this pregnant lady's eyes. Do yourself a favor and go there.
