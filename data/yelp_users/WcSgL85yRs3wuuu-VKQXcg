Ok - so I used to live minutes from china town in NYC...  so I'm perhaps a little spoiled.  I realize that.   I still have not found a Chinese food place here in phoenix that I'm crazy about...I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm not gonna. That being said... this is by far the *worst* Chinese I've had here so far. They are right around the corner from where i live so i decided to give it a try for take out one night... they got our order wrong, it took forever, and it was completely flavorless...  I had a few bites and lost my appetite.  Maybe I ordered the wrong things...  maybe I was there on an off night...   who knows.  But as far as I'm concerned - Vegetable lo mien shouldn't be that difficult to get right.  My boyfriends meal (forget what he got) was no better.   I won't be going back.  Its a real shame too since the location is ideal for me....

Simply put... My home away from home. Lux is so much more than a coffee bar...  it's a community.  The staff is great, the owner has an amazing memory for names and faces...  I'm constantly impressed, and the people who frequent this great spot are eclectic, intelligent and friendly.  It's like Cheers... but better.... and without the booze..... *anyway* you get my point... from my first visit here, it has felt like home and over the years I've made more great friends here than I can count. 'nuf said.

So.... i can't really speak to the 'wash' part cause the one time I tried to wash my 65lb hunk of scardy cat, thinks he's a lap dog, mutt...he, well.... pooped himself....  he was so traumatized that he didn't want to leave the house for a week for fear we might be going back to the place with the spraying water!  Oh well - I tried.  as for the rest of the place...  I love it! Sooooo much better than going to a big box store.  Better stuff... better prices... personal service... wonderful, knowledgeable (and I might add attractive!)  staff.   They were even able to give me great advise to litter box train my developmentally delayed garbage pal kitty that just wasn't getting the concept.  (my animals are starting to sound really screwed up, huh?  that's not a reflection on me, is it? )   *anyway*  For a small place they have a great deal of variety, lots of fun dog and cat toys... and the gourmet treats?  Look and smell so good they make *me* hungry!  Not to mention, the owners are great guys - very community minded and that goes a long way in my book.    oh and the rewards program is great, definitely worth signing up for.  If only they sold fish food - I'd never have to go anywhere else. Check 'em out.  Hopefully you'll have better luck with the wash than i did!

Found this place by accident....  must say I was pretty impressed.  Went for lunch, and I'm excited to go back at night for some live music.... only downside was the lack of good cover on the back patio.  Its totally cute and I love patios... but every time the wind blew my iced tea (which, BTW, is ridiculously good)  filled up with little tiny leaves. But aside from that small set back... our waiter was personable and attentive, the food was surprisingly good, and the ambiance just right.... The menu is a little sparse, but I kind of like that...  they don't try to do too many things, and what they do - they do well. The servings are huge.  I wound up taking half my panini home (guess I shouldn't have filed up on the bruschetta!)  - what really impressed me was that it was still good heated up in the microwave the next day...  sandwiches, let alone paninis - don't normally keep that well.  all in all a good experience, happy I stumbled upon it.... I'll be back.
