This place is good.  Really good.  I give it the 3 C's: casual, cute and relatively cheap.  Its a great place to go if everyone your eating with can't decide on what to eat... Pasta?  Check.  Soup noodles?  Check.  Sushi?  Check.  The chicken parm and salmon pastas were delicious!  Can't wait to go back!

Bad service. OK food. Overpriced prices (but hey, its Vegas). I like the decor but a 20 minute meal took an hour because the waitstaff was so inattentive.

This is now my go to restaurant in Phoenix. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and each area makes for an intimate dining experience despite the restaurant being so big.  The sticky bun starter is amazing delicious and it is the perfect precursor for the rest of the meal. I ordered the seafood pasta which was absolutely delicious but after sampling some other dishes, it'll be hard to pick a favorite so I'm going to have to suggest dining family style the next time. Just one little note.... Don't order the lobster mac and cheese because if you are expecting to get lobster, you'll be very disappointed.
