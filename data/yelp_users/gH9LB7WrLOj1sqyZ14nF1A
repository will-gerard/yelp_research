This is the second time I have taken my Jeep to Whitey's and both times I have been very pleased. JP, the mechanic, always took the time to explain what was wrong and go over my options with me. After I had the options, I priced shopped them and found their rates to be very reasonable. Although it may take a day or three to get an appointment, in my opinion, it is well worth the wait. When I drop my car off, I feel like I am in good hands and never have to worry about being ripped off. I would highly recommend Whitey's to anyone!

These guys do awesome work at such a fair price. I am a long time customer of Sun Devil Trophy and I will never go anywhere else. Give them a try once and you will be the same way.

I made a reservation online for my wife and I to eat at Orange Sky. I got on early in the morning and was pleased to see that they had a 7pm reservation for the 2 of us available, so I booked that time. The confirmation said one of their hostess will be sending me an email shortly to confirm my reservation. Some time passed and I had not received a confirmation back so I called them at noon and got their voicemail. I tried back at 2pm and finally left a message on my third call at 4pm. As we were getting ready to leave our house, about 620pm, someone finally called me back and told me that they don't have a reservation or a space for us. The frustrating part was they called us back so late that we were not able to get another reservation until 8:45.   Be leery of their online reservation system and don't trust it until you get something back from them.

King came out to fix a garbage disposal and spray hose for a house that I am selling. The technician, Brendan, showed up early and was very professional. He fixed both items in a very timely fashion and did it with a great attitude. I would definitely use King again!

I called Mr. Sparky out for a breaker that kept tripping and they came out on a SUNDAY! I thought he would just need to replace the breaker and be on his way. When the technician arrived, he was very pleasant and very professional. As he diagnosed the problem we went above and beyond what he needed to and found a bigger looming problem in my attic. He gladly jumped into my attic and took care of the problem without hesitation. I could not believe that someone would take the time to crawl through my attic on Sunday afternoon, I was impressed.   I did a little research on this company and they have a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. When I consider the guarantee and the helpfulness of the technician I will never call another electrician!

I had Easy Air come out and install a new system on my house. The technicians that came out were extremely friendly and very knowledgeable about the process. I found their price to be very fair and worth every penny. Now they come out to my house twice a year to service the AC unit, as we all know in AZ, you can't beat that service! I would recommend Easy Air to everyone.

Easy Air did it again for me. I manage properties for a living and Easy Air is a company you can count on. I got a call Friday at 3pm from a tenant that had a blower motor go out. Easy air diagnosed the problem, which is to be expected, but what they did after that is what I consider to be exceptional service. Within two hours of the call coming in, they had the problem diagnosed and got someone across town to get the part we needed before the supplier closed at 5pm on Friday. By doing this, they were able to have my tenant cooling again by Saturday morning. In addition, I received a call from Tim on Saturday morning, even though it was his day off, to let me know that everything was taken care of and the tenant was in good hands. If you want an AC company that you can count on to get the job done right, I would highly recommend Easy Air.
