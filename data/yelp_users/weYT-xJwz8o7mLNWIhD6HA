Stopped in for lunch, and it was definitely a solid "meh."  Lunch buffet is $8.99, which was a bit steep considering the lack of selections (only 2 chicken dishes, chicken curry and tandoori chicken, neither spectacular).  The vegetable curry was fine but again, nothing special, and everything else was quite bland.  I won't be returning.

Been desperately (desperately!) searching for a ramen place in Phx after discovering the deliciousness that is ramen in San Diego, and I was pleasantly surprised when I drove by the "Noodles" sign on my way to a hair appointment down the street at Shampoo Ink.  Made a mental note to stop in afterwards for lunch. I am SO glad I did!  Service was stellar - really some of the best service I've had in a LONG time.  Super friendly and attentive.  The ramen dishes were all pork per the menu, but they were nice enough to sub chicken for me instead of the pork.  DELISH!  SO good.  No veggies like the place I love in Oceanside, CA, but still, the flavor was there and it was awesome.  This will be my new lunch place EVERY time I get my hair done.

Hubby and I love this place.  Good service, great food, OK prices (hence the 4 stars).  Have had the fondue appetizer twice here and it's awesome.  Get it on happy hour!  Dinner entree I had was a chicken dish with mashed potatoes - A-mazing.  I'm always a little hesitant to order chicken because it's often dried out, but this was moist and delicious.  Had a starter caesar salad which was "ok" - maybe had a little too much anchovy in the dressing for my liking?  Overall a terrific place, and we'll certainly be back.  Mondays they have happy hour 3pm to close!

Took hubby here for pre-birthday dinner drinks, and we loved it! Love the dimly lit bar & terrific ambiance.  The bartender was very friendly and recommended great drinks. Had the best Bellini I've ever had.  Can't say it's cheap, we spent $50 just on 4 drinks, but for a special occassion it was worth it.

OMG the shrimp etouffee. No really. OMG. SO delicious it's ridiculous.   Went here the night of Fat Tuesday... so cliche I know. Got there about 5:30p. Place was packed of course. Hostess let us know the wait for a table would be about an hour and half but we could drink/eat at the bar in the meantime. Sold.   Started out with a hurricane (it was Fat Tuesday after all) and it was pretty good. $5? Even better.   Had an app at the bar, the crab cakes. Moist and delicious but super spicy. And I love spicy. But this was almost too much. Still, I would get it again. Yummy.   After getting a table (yes, about an hour and half later), we ordered another app (hey, we'd been drinking for an hour and half!), the Lulu Wings. These were OK. The flavor was awesome, kind of a honey-Tabasco. But I thought they were a bit tough and dry, and I didn't like the fact that there wasn't a dipping sauce for them. Won't order them again.   For dinner, we ordered a smorgasbord of food so we could try lots of things. I had the shrimp etouffee. See first line of this review. OMG... I was too full to try anything else at this point but the hubby liked everything he had (gumbo, red beans/rice, crawfish etouffee).   p.s. the garlic bread that's served with everything is also delicious.   Final verdict, unbelievable food and I can't wait to go back.  Especially so I can try the bread pudding.

I know my 2 girlfriends that absolutely LOVE this place will balk at my 4 stars instead of 5. But honestly, I think this place is slightly overrated. Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating.   We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a "valet" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK.   Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent.   We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about).   For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto.   And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini).   And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)

SUCH a great little place! Nice decor, great service, AMAZING patio and view, 5 stars all the way.  Haven't had their food yet, but I will be back for sure and looking forward to trying the menu (sounds like they have a good variety). Wish I lived closer so I could come here all the time.  Looking forward to stopping in whenever I'm in the area.

Despite the crappy reviews, I have to say I'm a fan of this place!  Met a co-worker here for happy hour (which is M-F 3-7p), and was pleasantly surprised by the decent service, cheap drinks ($3.25 mixed well and even less for huge draft beers that the hubby was drinking), and 1/2 price appetizers.  We ordered 2 apps, the Firecracker Stuffed Jalapenos (YUM) and the chicken quesadilla (double YUM).  Perhaps we were just really hungry, but at like $4 each they were awesome!!!  Also, their salsa is no joke.  It's tasty and spicy, just how I like it.  I only wish they had stopped bringing us the "bottomless chips" because I just kept eating that salsa all night.  I would say that their salsa would be on my top 10 list...  Hmm, speaking of a list...  Anyway, if you're in the area and are looking for a good, cheap happy hour, give this place a chance.

Going to the DR's office is bad enough, but this place takes it to a whole new level of low.  Seriously, I interacted with about 4 or 5 different people (because that's what happens when you get herded like cattle) and only the PA that finally saw me could crack a smile or be the slightest bit friendly.  No kidding, all the assistants, receptionist, billing person, EVERYONE had something seriously shoved up their you-know-what.  I mean come on people, you're working in a doctor's office, you could probably get that checked out??  I will NEVER return.

After a disappointing night at Rawhide the night before, Goldfield Ghost Town was a delightful surprise!  It was fun not only our out of town friends, but for hubby and I as well.  We got there just in time for their "gun show" (on the hour every hour), and I have to admit, I jumped more than once.  Those gun shots sounded mighty convincing.  We milled around after the show and took some great pics, both scenic and comical.  We then decided to go on the mine tour ($7/pp) which was informative as well as entertaining.  After the mine tour we took a break from the action by having some cold beers and snacks.  Beers were $3 and quesadillas like $4.50 - what a deal!  Especially considering they could charge an arm and a leg for both since you're out in the middle of nowhere!  To finish the day, we went on the train ride ($6), a 20 minute narrated tour.  I loved it for the great scenery, hubby loved it for the history lesson.  Our visiting guests had a blast, and they commented a couple times that it was much better than Rawhide.  So take note, if you have guests in from out of town that haven't been to AZ before - take them to Goldfield Ghost Town.

Was disappointed that Chandler Pho wasn't open on Tuesday when I tried to go check them out, and once I'm craving pho nothing else will do.  So I drove up to Saigon based on a friend's recommendation and since I hadn't tried it before either.  Was surprised by how BIG the place is!  Looks smaller from the outside.  It was lunch time and it was packed!  I thought service would be slow, but I was pleasantly surprised when I was given water as soon as I sat down, a menu just moments later, and they came to take my order within minutes.  Did I mention the place was PACKED?  Got my pho in less time than I could do an inventory of the table to make sure I had the soy sauce and sriracha I needed.  I asked for extra onions/cilantro and again, less than 2 minutes later they were at my table.  Whoa.  These people know how to be quick.  Love it.  My pho was delicious.  I always get the pho ga (chicken), and this one was among the tastiest I've had.    Only knock on this place is that they have Pepsi products (blech) vs Coke products, and I didn't notice if they have beer/booze since I was there for lunch.  But otherwise it was awesome, and I will be back.

Went here for my mother-in-law's birthday a few days ago.  Had a great experience overall.  Called ahead and made the reservation for 5 people at 7pm.  Clearly I didn't need one.  We got there and the place was dead.  Service was good, attentive, although she could have been just a bit more "happy".    I ordered a dirty martini to drink (very good) and the grilled chicken breast entree for dinner.  Had a side salad with ranch - fresh and chilled, it was great.  Had steamed broccoli with the chicken which was absolutely awesome (as awesome as steamed broccoli can be) but I wish there was more than the 3 or 4 pieces I got.  Seriously - my plate looked really sad with just a couple pieces of broccoli, while everyone else's plates were overflowing with mashed potatoes or huge double baked potatoes.  Guess that's what I get for trying to eat healthy.  The chicken breast was tender and juicy - yum.  I ate every single last bite.  For dessert they brought out the chocolate chip cookie and ice cream (on the house for the birthday girl) and it was SO good.  I would eat healthy every meal if it meant I could finish with a dessert like that.  Mmm.  Definitely 2 thumbs up.

If I could give zero stars I would.  Stopped in for lunch. No one in the place (not a single soul), that was probably my first warning. I sat down anyway, on their hard, uncomfortable plastic chairs (seriously, the decor is very cafeteria like), and started to look over the menu. Pho for $10?? It better be some amazingly good pho! So I sat and I sat, waited and waited. The server/owner/manager/whoever that greeted me when I walked in had gone in the back and after waiting 10 minutes I decided to just leave. Give me a break. There is NO ONE in the place. I'm your ONLY customer and you're going to just let me sit there forever? No thanks. Went to my usual go-to for pho at Pho Van and had an awesome lunch.

Oh Z, how do I love thee.  Let me count the ways.  1. LOVE your margaritas.  Seriously.  I'm not a fan of tequila and/or margaritas generally speaking, but I love Z's margaritas.  Especially the Chambord and Prickly Pear.   Be warned though - they're VERY dangerous.  2. SALSA!  I love it!  They also have an appetizer with a variety of 3 salsas, but honestly, their original is the best.  The chips are good too - light and crispy.  3. EVERYTHING on the menu.  Not kidding.  I haven't had anything I didn't like at Z.  My faves include: catfish tacos, Jerk Chicken salad, Diablo Pasta, Wild Mushroom enchiladas, Mac & Cheese w/o bacon, the trout, seriously, the list could go on and on.  My mouth is watering.  I think you get the point.  Go to Z.  ASAP.

I guess I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain, but I was quite disappointed in this place. Went for happy hour with some friends who apparently like coming here (not sure why though).   Although I will say that the service was awesome, the "good" ends there.   The food, meh. We had some apps including calamari (kinda tough), spinach dip (I've had better), and the avocado rolls (the best out of the 3). Not super impressed with any of it.   The drinks, they were made well, but at $4.75 for WELL on HAPPY HOUR - it really didn't make me very happy at all.   Next time I will go somewhere else for happy hour where the food and drink prices really do make me happy.

What can I say... if I were Don and owned this place, I would likely be a little crabby too.  Shouldn't have been too surprised though considering this is a bar in a strip-mall, but I had high hopes since it's across from fancy-schmancy Val Vista Lakes.  I like dive bars, don't get me wrong, but this place was just kind of weird.  We walked in and it felt like a big empty room... which it really was actually.  I'm not sure if it's a dance floor at night perhaps?  But it was just a strange feeling and layout.   The place was dead, I could count the number of people in there on 1 hand (granted it was like 5pm on a Thursday, but hello... happy hour anyone?) and it was also super quiet and awkward (hello, MUSIC anyone?).  We had one drink and left.  Not the worst dive bar I've been to, but certainly not even close to being the best.

SO happy I found this place!  Thanks fellow Yelpers!  I had a strap break on one of my fave pair of shoes, and I desperately tried finding a similar replacement pair for weeks before giving in to the fact that I wouldn't be able to replace them.  I had to try to get them fixed instead.  Thanks to Best Shoe Repair they fixed them BETTER THAN NEW, and I am one happy girl.  It only cost me $15 and they had it ready for me in about 3 days.  I LOVE this place & will be bringing them any of my shoes, bags, belts, etc that need repair!

I don't usually go out for breakfast (would rather sleep in if I have the choice) but hubby and I met his mother here for breakfast last week, and I was glad I got out of bed for it.  Arrived at about 9:30am and got a table right away.  Service was quick and friendly.  I ordered an omelet with green onions, green chili, salsa and cheese.  It was quite tasty but it almost had TOO much stuff in it!  Really - it had so much chili, salsa, etc, that I barely tasted the egg!  Plus for some, negative for others perhaps?  I liked it but also wouldn't have minded a little less "stuff" in the omelet.  Hubby and mother-in-law both loved their food.  We all shared a cinnamon roll and OH-MY-GOSH was it delicious!  I pretty much let them have a taste then devoured the rest of it myself.  If you go here, you MUST get the cinnamon roll.  The cream cheese frosting is unbelievable.    All in all I can't wait to go back here.  I will likely try a different omelet next time and I will DEFINITELY order the cinnamon roll again.  My mouth is watering already...

OMG.  I wish I could eat here every single day.  I've only been twice (sadly) but will be going here often now that I've discovered them.  Absolutely DELICIOUS.  YUMMY.  TASTY.  AWESOME.  First time we went a little nuts and ordered a couple appetizers as well as sandwhiches.  Had the Goat Cheese Bruschetta as well as the Green Chili Mushroom Phyllos.  Both delish, but very different.  The bruschetta is for balsamic vinegar lovers.  The phyllos are for mushroom/cream cheese lovers.  For sandwiches we had the It's About Thyme Chicken and Still Crazy After All These Years Veggie (we split them, of course, I'm not that much of a pig!).  They were both HEAVENLY.  Can I use that word to describe sandwiches??  Well I am.  The chicken is full of mushroomy-cheesy goodness, and the veggie was so unique with the beer battered mozzarella!  The 2nd time we went, I ordered the Chile Verde Birdie Turkey and was mildly disappointed, I think because I was expecting it to be a hot sandwich and got a cold one instead (my bad for not reading the menu carefully enough).  If I had read the menu more carefully and knew what to expect I would have been much more pleased with it.  My fault, not theirs.  Oh, both times had the prickly pear lemonade (spiked of course) - very tasty.  The only knock I will give this place is the guy who might run the place (not sure, either that or he wishes he did).  Both times we've come we wanted to sit on the patio outside and he gave us trouble each time about it.  Really?  Then why have a patio??  But I am still giving this place 5 stars because I so LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their food.  Can't wait to go back.

Wow, I almost feel bad rating this only 2 stars since everyone else rated it so highly, but honestly, I was NOT impressed and I will NOT be back.  I drive by here ALL the time, and have always thought, "if a SHACK can stay in business, it MUST be good!"  Well perhaps I had too high of hopes for a shack afterall.  I ordered the chicken burrito (my staple at any fast food mexican place), and I was surprised when the girl taking my order said there were beans, cheese and pico inside along with the chicken, but I figured, hey, I'll try it since that's how they make it.... and again, if a shack of a business stays open, they must know what they're doing.  Well, after taking my first bite, I realized that I not only was I glad that there were beans, cheese and pico, but it was actually the best part of the burrito.  Although this was a "chicken burrito" - the chicken itself was dry and tasteless and totally ruined the burrito.  I ended up picking out most of it and just eating a "bean, cheese & pico burrito" instead.  Another gripe, they gave me their "hot sauce" along with the burrito, and similar to the chicken, it was bland and tasteless.  Wouldn't call it mild, much less hot.  Sigh...  Very disappointing meal I must say.

Wow, I'm still the only person that doesn't like this place?? I don't get it. What am I missing? Oh I know... FLAVOR.   Gave this place a 2nd try and was even more disappointed than the first time. Got a breakfast burrito with eggs, beans, cheese (supposedly), and green chilies. I may as well have had a piece of cardboard. Seriously, NO FLAVOR. I poured their salsa and hot sauce all over it and I barely noticed it (they use the word "hot" very liberally).   Perhaps if I ate meat other than chicken I'd like the food here, but both the chicken burrito I had the first time and the breakfast burrito I had today were tasteless, so 2 strikes and you're out on this one.

Honestly, I come here when I'm en route to QC Olive Mill. I come to pick up some unique local gifts for out of town friends/family, but each time I come I'm a little disappointed in their lack of friendliness or helpfulness. I'm never greeted when I come into the store (even though it's always dead), and when I ask questions about the different products I get a half-assed answer.   I still stop by each time I go to QCOM to get a couple of local preserves or salsas for my gift baskets, but I'm certainly not coming with the hopes of being greeted with a smile, and I don't bother asking questions anymore...

Have lived in SE Gilbert (might as well be QC it's so far SE) for about 2 years and just now discovered this gem.  The building is gorgeous... from the outside.  The inside leaves something to be desired... not much ambiance.  We went on a Sat night about 7:30pm.  There was a short wait (about 15 minutes).  The host sat us and gave us chips and salsa along with the menus, good thing since we were starving.  The salsa is very tasty, but I wish it had more heat.  We ordered a shredded chicken quesadilla to start.  OMG so f'ing delicious I want to eat it every day.  For our entrees, I got the pollo asado burrito enchilada style.  I kid you not, I'm drooling right now... literally there is drool dripping down my face...   The food is incredible.  Hubby got the carne asada GORDO burrito, which he loves, and I say that in the present tense because he is still eating it... and will be for the next 3 weeks.  It's that huge.  To drink we had prickly pear margaritas, which were awesome except for the price.  $8 a piece. Ouch.  For a place like this I was expecting margaritas to be cheap, like $4 at the most.  Service was great, food was great.  We will ABSOLUTELY be back.

I just discovered this place last week, and since it's right down the street from my new office it might get dangerous.  Came in just for a couple drinks and sat at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and fast, and the drinks were strong and reasonable.  The bar has a lot of space and a lot of pool tables and tvs.  Good place for an after work happy hour I think (for those looking for a divey and/or sports bar).

Friend and I got our nails done together next door and saw the sign for their lunch specials and decided to give them a shot.  Lunch specials are like $5.50 and include soup and egg roll.  Your typical selections, but they were nice enough to let us both substitute chicken for the beef in the "beef and broccoli".  The food was quick and tasty.  For the price, can't be beat.  I'm sure we'll be back when we get our nails done next door again.

It's been a while since I've been to Chevy's.  Too long.  I absolutely LOVE their salsa.  Love the smokey/roasted flavor.  Their chips are great too - light & crispy.  They also have a prickly pear margarita that is QUITE tasty.  But really, it's their salsa I go for.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.... mmm, salsa.

Stopped in here for lunch based on the reviews... and based on the sign that said they have $1.75 margaritas all day every day (don't judge, I had had a rough day).  Was greeted as soon as I walked in, and a server showed me to a table right away and took my drink order ($1.75 margarita please).  The margarita came quickly and it did not lack booze.  I ordered off their "Specials" menu and got the Baja Chicken Burro, and asked for beans instead of rice (no problem with the request).  While waiting for the food, I couldn't help eating a bowl and a half of their salsa.  Mmmmmm, mmmmm, good.  I told myself 2 or 3 times that it would be my last chip, but I kept going each time because the salsa was just damn good.  The food came out soon after - big portion, and all very tasty (although I have to admit, the chicken itself was a little bland, but the cream cheese sauce and loads of salsa was a saving grace).  I'm pretty sure I licked the beans off the plate... don't judge.  Did I mention I had had a rough day??  Although the chicken didn't impress, everything else I had did, so this place is a winner in my book.  How could you not love a place with $1.75 margaritas?

Yes, it's a chain mexican restaurant & having so many choices in the Valley, I should be ashamed to go here, but I've been eating here for YEARS.  The service is generally very good, servers are friendly and quick, and the food is consistently good.  I love their salsa and bean dip they bring out with chips.  A little bit of bean dip + a lot of salsa = a happy mouth.

Hands down my new favorite restaurant. Have only been twice so far, but have tried many items on the menu and everything has been delicious. Both times I went with a friend of the owner and he ordered a variety of items so we could sample a lot of things.   The hi-lites include: the margherita pizza - I am probably forever ruined for any other pizza. The calamari - tender and tasty. The chicken marsala - would prefer it with pasta (came with veggies & potatoes) but absolutely delicious. The orechiette with eggplant, huge portion and so good. I don't eat proscuitto but my husband does and he absolutely loved it with the soft cheese appetizer (don't remember the name) - I did try the soft cheese and it was incredible.  First time we went the server gave us our bill without asking if we wanted dessert or coffee (which I was there with old world Italians so espresso at the end of the meal is a must) so that was a bit of a turnoff, but otherwise the service is good, ambience is great (live music on Friday night was lovely but a little loud).  They serve Illy coffee which is one of my favorites and always brings me back to my trip to Italy, and an Illy cappuccino is the perfect way to end the night IMO. Haven't tried the desserts yet but heard the tiramisu is amazing and will have that next time. Can't wait to go back again, and again.

Went for a free poker tournament and was quite disappointed (and disgusted?) in the place.  I literally STUCK to the floor.  It was gross.  Their carpet is nasty.  The bathroom wasn't much better.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't expect a lot from a sports bars, but I also don't expect to stick to the floor!  The waitress I had was great, and the drinks were cheap and strong - but not enough so to bring me back in the future. 2 thumbs down.

Came to see Love, Loss and What I Wore.  My first time seeing a show here - what a beautiful venue!!  I was impressed with everything from the lobby, to the service at the bar, and even the bathrooms!    Our seats were in the special "social media" rows where we could tweet during the show.  What a cool concept!  Not sure if it was the idea of the show producers or the theater, but I thought it was a fun thing to do and hope they do it for future shows as well.  Definitely looking forward to coming back for future shows & events here!

Well, you would think that I would learn my lesson.  I should NOT be doing anything before reading the reviews on Yelp first!    We had friends in from out of town over the holidays, and we thought we'd take them to see some of the "old west" and have some fun.    Sadly, it ended up being pretty lame to be brutally honest.  We did have some fun having our husbands arrested, and they had some fun drinking a whiskey at the saloon, but other than that, Rawhide is definitely meant for kids.  EXCEPT for the super strong margaritas at the Margarita Bar.  ;)  Unless you're taking kids, skip Rawhide and take your out of towners to Goldfield Ghost Town in AJ instead.

Saw Adam Carolla here last week (who by the way was hilarious). We had dinner reservations (you come for dinner and get priority seating).  Got there about 30 minutes after doors opened (an hour and half before show start time) and the place was already packed.  We got seats on the 1st floor but toward the back - good view nonetheless (and Adam actually walked right by me and gave me a high five).  Ordered the calamari to start - very tasty.  For dinner I had the pasta alfredo with portabello (yummy) and husband had the prime rib (he enjoyed it).  Had a couple cocktails and a couple beers.  Bill came to something like $130! YIKES!   Service was great, food was great, drinks were great, prices not-so-great!!!  Would love to come back again but will have to be more mindful of what we order so we don't spend an arm and a leg.  FYI, the portions are large for the entrees so they could easily be shared between 2 people.

Been meaning to try this place for a while and was finally in the area for lunch.  Had the "no harm parm" chicken sandwich.  Was super tasty except I discovered I'm not a fan of mock cheese.  I love me some mock chicken, but apparently not mock mozzarella.  Had the thyme fries as my side and they were awesome, and I'm usually not a lover of shoestring fries.  Warning though, they were very garlicky so had to do double duty on the mints after wards since I was meeting clients.  Looking forward to going back to try the mushroom "chicken" drunken noodles!  Yum!

Although a bit pricey (hence the 4 stars), the martinis are GREAT, as is the food (the cobb salad is the best I've ever had).  Good service, cool crowd... can't wait until I can go back, which sadly is not soon enough now that I live in San Diego.

Oh AZ88 how I love you... But $14+ for a martini?  Come on... We're not in Manhattan.  I'm pretty sure that's the last place I paid that much for a drink.  Maybe I just don't spend enough time in Scottsdale? (My wallet thanks me)  The service is fantastic, as is the people watching, but the food was just so-so yesterday (had a chicken sandwich which was pretty dry & my friend wasn't thrilled with her food either).  Nonetheless, I will be back to over-pay for the delicious drinks & enjoy the ambience & I'll be sure to order the Cobb salad next time which was amazing the first time I had it (& the words "amazing" and "salad" rarely come out of my mouth!).

I really, really love Fez.  I love the vibe, I love the drinks, and I love the turkey burger.  Weren't expecting that one, were ya?  No really, the turkey burger is kind of ridiculously delicious.  Take my advice, get their turkey burger.  Also LOVE their Tuesday martini deal, $5 for the top 5 martinis on their menu. Awesome martinis at an awesome price.  Yes, please.  Did I mention their turkey burger?

We go here whenever we go to Pho Van a couple doors down, and can't resist having a little gelato no matter how full we are after dinner.  They have a zillion (seriously, no fewer than a zillion) flavors to choose from including dairy based gelato as well as fruit based sorbets.  I've sampled a few different flavors (both gelato and sorbet) and they're ALL delicious!    It's a little pricey ($3+ for a small - and considering I'm used to going to the self serve places where I can get little bit of this and a little bit of that for like $1.50, $3+ seems like a lot) however the small is more-than-enough since it's so rich - wish they had a kid's size in fact.    Will continue to come here and try new flavors.  If you're in the area - it's a must try.

In town for a conference at the MGM so went here for lunch during the conference.  Ordered the turkey sandwich, their tomato soup and a mini chocolate cupcake (leaving half for my lunch the next day! I'm not a pig!).    Let me just tell you, it was ALL very "meh".  Seriously.  None of it was very good.  And I wouldn't order any of it again.    If you are craving a good (or better yet, FREAKIN' DELICIOUS) sandwich while on the strip, go to Earl's at Planet Hollywood.  End of story.

Went here with a co-worker for a quick lunch last week, and I now understand what the buzz is all about.  The food is tasty, healthy and simple.  Simple meaning that it doesn't have all kinds of crazy stuff/ingredients in it, and you can order a light healthy lunch easily.  We shared the trio hummus and a veggie pizza.  Both awesome, although I would say I've had hummus that is just as good elsewhere (but I guess how amazing can one make hummus, really?  it's chickpeas, garlic and whatever else you throw in there).  However I was QUITE impressed with the veggie pizza.  Perfect size for sharing, and the veggies were so fresh and colorful!  What a treat!  Will be back I'm sure.  I have a closer one in Gilbert & am hoping the food is consistently good across all their locations.

Went at 2pm on a Thursday and they were closed. Sign on the window says open daily 10am to 11pm.  Except 2pm on Thursdays apparently.   By the way, if you happen to go and they are actually open, they accept cash only (as evidenced by their huge sign on the window). I don't think I'll be giving them another shot.

Living in Phoenix it's important to have an AC company you can rely on, and West Coast Plumbing & Air is that company.  I used them this week for the first time, and it was a great experience beginning to end.   I scheduled a routine maintenance check to make sure my old AC will be ready for another hot summer. The technician was on time, very friendly and knowledgeable.    To my disappointment the unit needed some new parts (disappointing but not a surprise since the unit is 12+ years old), and the tech took the time to show me the parts on the unit and explain everything in detail.  When we started talking about the price for the parts, he had everything in his book, which means they're not just setting prices as they feel like it - the prices for every part are outlined in their binder.  No nonsense & no price gouging, I like that.  The tech had to go pick up some of the parts but came back and finished the work same day.  I will absolutely use West Coast again, and I would recommend them to anyone needing AC or plumbing work!

Gotta say, for a dry cleaner, this really is as good as it gets!  The service here is unbelievable!  When I walk in I am always greeted with a huge smile and warm welcome from atleast 1, but usually 2 or 3 of the people working there.  Seriously, you would think that this is the best job in the world from their smiling faces and positive attitudes.  I love it.  I always bring coupons so the prices are great.  They do a good job on the shirts - have only had 1 "issue" where the shirt had been pressed funny and had a weird crease, but they re-did for free, no hassle.  I know it's hard to get excited about a dry cleaner, but these employees do and it's contagious because I'm super excited to have them doing my dry cleaning!  Thanks Delia's!!!  =)

WOW. DELISH!  I will absolutely be coming back here.  For their food, not for their service though.  The busser was horrible and we had to ask for things numerous times, but the food is worth it.  I had the garlic chicken, medium to very spicy, and it was unbelievably tasty!  I'm still full right now but if you put a plate of it in front of me, I would eat it all.  Went for lunch, got there at 12pm and got a table right away.  Lunch prices are great - about $6-7 for the whole meal which includes soup & spring roll (both tasty).  I will certainly be back, but maybe try for a less busy time (not peak lunch hours) in hopes of getting better service.

I love everyone at AZ Animal Wellness Center! Wow, they take care of my sweet dog (Cooper) as well, if not better, than I do.  They got me in for a same day appointment (within 45 minutes in fact!) when I called them about a concerning wound/lesion on his back.  They analyzed it and determined it needed to be removed and got him in for surgery the next morning.  Everyone was very loving toward Cooper and took great care of him.  He's back home and happy (although loopy from the morphine) and I'm so grateful for everyone, especially Dr. Heetland, who was our vet (but I heard from a friend that all the vets are great here). Thank you to everyone at AZ Animal Wellness Center for taking care of my baby!

Crazy stormy day yesterday & I realize one of my headlights went out.  Stopped in at Checker and Gregory came to my rescue! He got me the right bulb and changed it for me, and I was back on the wet/messy road within 10 minutes.  Awesome service. Thanks Gregory and Checker Auto!

I stopped in at Quizno's for lunch, not because I love Quizno's, but because I had a gift card.  I remembered why I don't love it.  The service was slow and not especially friendly, and the food is barely "ok".  I had the "choose 2 combo" with the Turkey Pesto Bullet (I think? it's the smaller sandwhich thing) and the tomato basil soup.  The Turkey Pesto was mostly bread, which was falling apart.  The soup was bland, even after the 2 packets of salt and pepper I dumped in.  The only thing I really like about Quizno's - the pepper bar - I love jalapenos and hot peppers and I love that I can serve myself and put as much or as little as I want on.  Other than that, I really don't see what all the hype is about Quizno's and how they're able to open up shop what seems like on every corner of the Valley?  Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things.  Oh well.

Everyone is very friendly & welcoming and they don't try to "upsell" you as much as some other places.  They always give me a bottle of water too, which is a nice touch.  Will continue coming here for sure.

Been looking for a tofu soup place and was excited to find this on Yelp.  The restaurant is a little hard to spot on Arizona Ave, and would have easily driven by it if I wasn't looking for it.  There weren't many people there when I walked in (just before lunch time on a Saturday), but by the end of my meal the place was packed.  Service was quick at first, but got a little slow once they got busy.  Still overall, good, attentive service.  I had the seafood tofu soup, very tasty.  I will try the mushroom tofu soup next time.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't serve the hot cucumbers as one of the side dishes, but all the sides they did serve were very good.  Wanted to take my family here on a Tuesday night and glad I checked their hours because they're CLOSED on Tuesdays.  Bummer.  Looking forward to going back!

Coming from someone who really only eats poultry/seafood, I still have to give this place 2 thumbs up.  Went here with the hubby to get him a steak & also because our new dog trainer recommended it to get dog bones.  Amazing selection of meats as well as wine/beer and the staff was very friendly.  And how awesome that they have natural bones/treats for dogs??  We will be coming here again.

Charm, character, and delicious food, what more could you ask for?  I really love this place - it's so different than any other restaurant around.  Love that they use fresh, local ingredients and I really do love the charm of the place.  Had the ahi sandwhich, YUM, and the hubby had the BBQ sampler plate and a shake and loved everything he had.  Will be bringing out of town visitors here for sure.

Y-U-M!  Bertha did not disappoint.  Both my friend and I had the asparagus and havarti panini based on the reviews (added chicken), and we both LOVED it.  It was very tasty, a huge portion, and super quick.  I will definitely be back when I'm in the area.

We're new to Gilbert so I don't have a big frame of reference, but I LOVE this place!  The bartenders are great, and tonight we had a server, Stephanie, who was awesome.  The food is varied (typical bar food, and also Mexican, Italian, just about anything you would crave going to a bar) and everything has been good so far.  The chicken sliders are amazing - my favorite item so far, and with $3 off during happy hour (regularly $8.99) it's a great deal too!    FYI, the "hot" wings aren't that hot - the "atomic" are perfect if you like typical "hot" wings.  Yum.  Oh, also, during their happy hour they have martinis for $4.50!  Finally, if you're looking for a good place to watch sports, this is perfect as they have HD flat screen tvs everywhere - not a bad seat in the entire bar.  This will be one of our regular spots for sure.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was that last time we went the server was just "OK" so I'm not sure if it's hit or miss since our server tonight was exceptional.

Wow, I am so impressed with this company.  The owner, Kevin, is awesome and does the work himself.  They haven't had to advertise in over 2 years because all their business comes from referrals.  I can see why.  He came out to give me an estimate on Sunday, and by  Wednesday I had sunscreens and a new screen door installed.  He is very detail-oriented and takes the time to get the job done right.  I highly recommend this guy if you are needing any window screens, door screens, etc.  Check out his website as he does a lot more than just window screens (blinds/shutters, patio covers, etc).  Thanks so much Kevin!

Service is very friendly and helpful.  Told them it was my first time there, and the lady behind the counter came around to the front and walked me through their menu and told me the top picks.   I went with a rice bowl with jerk chicken (YUMMO!) except I wasn't a fan of the "Rumbi rice" she recommended because it was a tad on the sweet side (fyi, has coconut milk in it - not a fan).  Got the full order and it was HUGE.  It's like 3 portions, maybe 4 if you're skinny and don't eat that much.  :)  Great lunch stop, especially if you're meeting somone and can share a bowl.  Looking forward to trying their other items.

Oh Earl... how I love you... let me count the ways... the tuna melt, the jerk chicken, the soups... I love everything about you.  This is one of my fave stops when we come to Vegas.  I only wish they would open one in Phoenix.    BEST sandwiches EVER.  That is all.

Wow. The dessert was unbelievable. I will try to do a complete review and not only focus on the dessert, but seriously, that's all I can think about.   We went here for dinner last night. Although the service was friendly, it was quite slow. Slow to get our drinks, and slow to get the table-side guac. Once we did get them however, everything was awesome. Hubby ordered the strawberry mojito which he literally downed in about 3.5 seconds flat. He loved it. I had a dirty martini, and although the waiter forgot the olives, the martini itself was pretty darn good.   The table side guac was tasty and plentiful - easily enough for a group of 4. With just the 2 of us, we left a lot of it uneaten.   I ordered a "new" menu item, the portabella and goat cheese enchiladas, and the husband ordered the carne asada and camarones. We both LOVED our dishes. Although I was disappointed in the fact that I got a mango salad on the side instead of the rice which is what the waiter said I would be getting. Shame on me for not reading the menu more carefully (I hate mango).   Even though we were both delightfully stuffed, we ordered dessert. OMG. No really, OMG. The best dessert I've had in a LONG time. I keep thinking about it. I wish I could have another one today. We had the "Mexican Brownie". In case I didn't already mention it - OMG! SO absolutely delicious. It's a huge brownie filled with LOTS of nuts (I think walnuts, don't remember exactly), served on a hot skillet with vanilla ice cream and a brandy sauce. No really, I think I have to go over there today and get another one. It's so unbelievably tasty.   So, bottom line, when you go, whatever you do, you MUST leave room for this delicious chocolatey sizzling mouthwatering goodness.   p.s. I would give the place 5 stars if it wasn't for the slow service. Oh, also, it's a bit on the pricey side (specialty dishes, like the carne asada and shrimp the hubby had, are over $20).

I love this place and can't wait to return.  Disclaimer: we sat at the bar so we could watch the game, & when I walked through the restaurant to go to the bathroom, I got a "cafeteria" vibe from the place because it was so big, crowded, and noisy.  Not sure I would want to sit in the restaurant section honestly.  But the bartenders were great, and the sushi was awesome.  My 2 new favorite rolls (Baja roll & Lotus on Fire roll), YUM.

Had a quick dinner here before seeing a show at the Herberger Theater down the street, and I have to say I am glad we stumbled across this place!  The service was great (friendly and attentive), and the food delicious.  I stuffed myself much fuller than I should have but couldn't stop eating because it was so good.  They customized an order for me because I didn't want bell peppers but wanted eggplant (yes, I'm picky) and wanted their special chili-garlic sauce that I saw on some of their menu items.  The food was awesome.  Spicy and D-lish.  Very reasonable prices.  Will definitely be back when we're in downtown.

Wow, what a disappointment. I feel bad for those of you that rate this place highly, you really need to try some good Indian.   I didn't think it was possible to have bland Indian food but boy did this place prove me wrong. I stopped in for the lunch buffet based on a foursquare tip that the place was voted Best Indian in the New Times. I'm not sure who was doing the voting or the tallying, but I have to think it was a big mistake... or it was fixed.   I tried a couple of bites of almost everything on the lunch buffet, 4 or 5 different veggie options (I tried every veggie option they had) and 2 different chicken dishes (Tika Masala and Curry). All dishes except 1 (one of the veggie options, I don't remember which) was bland and needed salt. Mind you, I've NEVER once before used salt at an Indian restaurant. Here, everything needed it.   The only saving grace for this place was the garlic naan and the desserts - the minced carrots with sugar and cheese was tasty and different.   The service was less than mediocre - had to ask for my drink twice and the bill twice.   Safe to say that I will NOT be returning.

I usually go to the other pho place in this complex but I've been to Pho 68 twice now & I think it's my new favorite. The service is incredible, and they offer a 'large' pho which I love because I really like a lot of broth.   Also, I don't use the sprouts/basil & instead use onions & cilantro (& I like A LOT of both) & they brought out an entire plate (other places I have to practically beg for extra onions/cilantro).   Love the decor & the Asian performances on the tv too. This place is a winner. I will be back regularly.

Went here before Tempe Improv based on the reviews.  LOVED IT!  What a great dive bar!  "Freaky" Doug (as he's known) was our bartender.  He was awesome and gave us free shots.  Cheap/free drinks and good service - what more do you need?  We'll be back when we're in this area.

Stopped in here today as I was in the area and it was kinda gloomy weather, perfect for pho!  I'm a fan of Pho Van down the road and wanted to compare this place.  I only get Pho Ga (chicken) and it seems that it always tastes pretty much the same no matter where I go, so all I can really compare/rate is the service and the "extras".  By extras, I mean the tasty goodness that you put into pho - like cilantro, onions, bean sprouts, limes, etc.  Service was good, quick and friendly.  Then came the extras.  A mound of bean sprouts (good start), 3 slices fresh jalapeno (good), 1 slice lime (so-so) but no onions or cilantro (bad news).  I asked the server for cilantro and onions.  She hesitated for a second, then nodded, but still seemed surprised at my request (wha?! what pho place doesn't give you cilantro and onions??).  She brought my bowl of steaming hot pho, still no cilantro and onions, but I did see that there was a layer of cilantro and onions floating in the soup.  I guess that will have to do.  I had to ask for soy sauce.  (Wha?! What pho place doesn't have soy sauce on the table??)  SO, overall, VERY delicious (I don't think I left a single drop of broth in that bowl), but I was a little miffed by the lack of "extras".  For $6.75 though, a good meal and I would come in again.

I REALLY want to give this place 5 stars but due to the service I simply cannot.  But the food was AH-mazing.  Some of the best chicken I've ever had.    Had the chicken burrito combo, and although the rice and beans were just OK, I thought I might cry right into my platter because the chicken burrito was so delicious.  The chicken was so tender and juicy... ohmygawd I am drooling just thinking about it, and I am still overwhelmingly full from the meal.  The burrito also had onions (both white and green) and cilantro (YES PLEASE!) which I'm sure added to the overall deliciousness.    Sadly the service was less than stellar and SUPER slow (and I was the ONLY one in the restaurant so no excuses), but their food (and cheap prices!) will certainly get me coming back.  Nom nom nom.

I live about 10-15 minutes from here and drive by on occasion and have been wanting to check it out. I finally had an excuse to go, as I wanted to find/buy some unique gifts to ship to my brother for his birthday.   I came to QCOM on a Thursday mid-day and you would have thought it was Saturday afternoon with as busy as it was. There was plenty of parking however, and I didn't have to bump too many elbows to get some of their tasty samples of tapenades and olive oils. I did however have to wait in a long line to order my lunch, which I wasn't too thrilled about considering there was a managerial-looking guy behind the counter, not looking like he was doing much other than standing around.   I ordered the Manzi panini based on the suggestion of the lady taking my order - grilled chicken breast, fontina cheese, basil, sun-dried tomato tapenade and one of their balsamic vinaigrettes. Overall it was "good" but COULD have been fantastic if they hadn't been stingy on the tapenade and/or balsamic. It just didn't have that much flavor honestly. The bread was tasty though as were the "gourmet chips" they served along side the sandwich.   For the panini and drink, I paid just over $12. A little steep in my opinion.   Still, I love the variety of goodies you can get hear (all kinds of olives, tapenades, dressings, oils, vinegars, etc) and I will definitely be back here when I have guests in from out of town. I just hope the next panini I order has a bit more oomph.

Was introduced to Pho by some friends while we were in Vegas and I fell in LOVE.  Really, it's the most deliciousness you can put in a bowl.  So, after coming back from Vegas I was on a quest to find a local Pho place. Based on the reviews, I came here.  Was not disappointed.    The service was great and the chicken pho was great too.  Quick, delicious, with plenty of noodles.  Went back for a 2nd visit and service and food was consistent.  And at $6.75 a bowl, I can afford to come here all the time! Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it wasn't as delicious as the pho I had in Vegas and also there is only 1 choice for chicken pho. But I will be returning for that 1 choice time and time again.

Kept hearing good things about the happy hour here so we finally stopped in. And WOW, can't believe it took us so long to check it out - it's now one of my new fave places. The happy hour is INCREDIBLE! For $3 you get some amazing food, got 2 apps and it was more than enough as a meal.   The 2 apps I had were the shrimp/eggplant which was so MOUTH-WATERING-DELICIOUS-I-WANT-SOME-RIGHT-NOW good, and also the margherita flatbread (also tasty).   Hubby had the Brio burger and it was HUGE.   The drinks were not on happy hour (boo) but I was happy to pay the $8 for the pomegranate martinis because they were delish!   We loved the place so much we took advantage of their gift card special, buy $100 and get a $20 card free.  Can't wait to go back!

Was in desperate need of caffeine and couldn't find my go-to (Starbucks, don't hate) so found this cute little place on Yelp. Was easier finding it on Yelp than in person honestly.  FYI, if you're going by the address, it's actually in the alley behind the street (so don't look on the street itself).  I'm guessing it was the owner who served me, very nice and friendly. Since it was late afternoon, I ordered a half reg half decaf coffee (lame, I know) so nothing extraordinary.  The coffee tasted a little watery to me, but I'm thinking that's partially my fault for getting half decaf?  I would certainly give them another "shot" next time I'm in the area. ;)

First time we came here they were closed - on a Tuesday.  So FYI, don't go on a Tuesday.  But go any other day, because it's great pho!  Have been here twice now (3 if you count the first disaster on a Tuesday), and have been very happy with the pho.  Had chicken pho the first time (my go-to) and it was good, but there's never really anything special about chicken pho.  2nd time I got the seafood pho.  Talk about special!  Full of delicious seafood goodness including crab legs, shrimp and scallops.  YUM!    Will definitely be back and will probably try their veggie pho next time, but the seafood pho will likely end up being my mainstay here.

I'm loving this place more and more.  Their pho is tasty, as is the Bun Rieu (?) (crab, shrimp, tofu, tomato noodle soup, YUM!).  The service is always fast and friendly.  Ice tea comes with a lime, I like that. 2 thumbs up all the way. Note, they're closed on Tuesdays!

Sigh. So sad to have to update my review here. Went for lunch with the hubs on a week day. Got in around 11:30am so we could beat the crazy lunch rush. Ordered the usual, egg rolls (delish by the way) and our pho bowls.  This is where things started to go downhill.  1) I ordered the large pho (I love me some extra broth) but I got the regular. 2) Hubs ordered a side of extra meat on the side. No extra meat on the side (they tried to tell us at the end that it was put into the soup. Nice try, but that's funny that every other time they've put it on the side.). 3) Asked for cilantro (I like a little pho with my cilantro, thank you very much), and they were OUT. Completely out of cilantro. How the hell does that happen?? At 11:30am? Are you kidding me.  3 strikes and you're out. Next time I will be going to Saigon Pho.

Yep, this place is a winner.  I've been here twice, and left happy both times.  I love that they have vegetarian pho (with tofu and veggies instead of meat) and the service is incredible - you can tell they really love their business and their customers.  I will absolutely be stopping here whenever I'm in the area.  FYI, they don't serve beer/booze, but you can buy it in the market next door and bring it in!

I stopped in for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised by their extensive lunch menu for around $5!  For $5.25 I got the chicken and broccoli, which came with soup, rice, spring roll and crab wonton.    Everything was tasty and with a soda and tax/tip I walked out spending a total of $10.  You can barely do that at McDonald's these days, and Mandarin Chef is much better than McD's any day of the week if you ask me.  I'll be back.

What can I say, The Keg never disappoints.  Their food is delish and their drinks are even better.  They made me an amazing strawberry martini that I still think about weeks later.  Sadly it was a "seasonal" drink so I won't be able to get it again until next spring/summer.  Their service is also always exceptional.  This is one of my fave spots, I just wish it was a little easier on the wallet.

OMG.  I can't stop thinking about my meal here.  Went for brunch on a Saturday morning about 10am.  Got a table for 4 right away.  Server was quick to greet us and brought our drinks just as quickly.   I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (one of my favorite brunch items), and hands-down, this is the BEST I've ever had.  No kidding.  It's been 3 days and I'm still thinking about it.  The dish consists of beans, tortilla (I went with flour), green chilis, salsa, and 2 eggs (I got mine over easy) and you also get a side of potatoes.  The potatoes weren't mind-blowing, but the rest of the dish certainly was.  I'm not sure what made it so delicious, but it seemed that every little bite was an explosion of flavor in my mouth.  Husband got the California Benny which he enjoyed, and our friends got a fruit platter (which looked very fresh) and a blueberry muffin (which was literally bursting with blueberries).  This was their 2nd breakfast of the day so they ate light - what a shame!  2 enthusiastic thumbs up for this place, and I can hardly wait to go back.  Of course since I'm going to have to order the Huevos Rancheros each time, I'll have to make hubby try the other menu items.

We had about 20 minutes (actually, like EXACTLY 20 minutes!) to kill before a movie at San Tan mall, so we decided to pop in for a quick drink.    We made it just in time for a last call for happy hour, and I was VERY pleasantly surprised to hear that I could get a Grey Goose martini for $5.  Sweet!  We also ordered the southwestern egg rolls - which seem like no matter where you order them they always taste the same - "tasty".    We told the waitress we were trying to make a movie, and she made sure to get us in and out in the the 20 minutes.  2 thumbs, and this will certainly NOT be the last happy hour here.

How can you not love a place that has 3 different kinds of Cholula and 2 kinds of Tabasco?!  AWESOME.  That alone is worth 5 stars.  I thought I should go with the house specialty and went with a "Brizza" - I ordered the Chicago, which has rosemary potatoes, sausage and cheese, but I substituted the regular sausage for turkey sausage.  Yummy.  The only disappointment was the crust - it was kind of doughy and just didn't have much flavor, thought they could have done more with it honestly (it was very plain).  I ended up eating mostly the toppings and left much of the pizza dough on the plate.  Extra points for having Coke products, and I will definitely have to return to try the french toast or cinnamon rolls.  I also liked the fact that your ordered & paid at the counter and then they brought your food out to you.  Very efficient and quick.  Overall, 2 thumbs up, and I will be back if I'm in the area for breakfast.

Was craving noodles and stopped in here not knowing what to expect. Didn't realize it was a make-your-own-meal kinda place, but I still went with it. I have to admit, along with some of the other reviewers here, I was a little grossed out by the frozen meat and "packing" everything down in the bowl. However I did like the fact that I could choose whatever veggies I wanted.   I went a bit crazy on the sauce (I REALLY like saucey food apparently) and went with 2 different ones (and like 4 ladles full between the 2) even though I didn't have any clue what they were. I was VERY pleasantly surprised with my concoction. It was delicious if I do say so myself. I got the food to-go and also got a bowl for my husband and used different meat and sauces for his, and he really liked his too. I'm not sure you can really screw up on this, unless you don't put enough sauce I guess in which case it could be bland? Go heavy on the sauce I say.... p.s. the meal comes with soup and I got the house special and it was awesome!

Shame on me for not checking out the reviews first.  I was in the area running errands and hadn't had anything to eat all day so I thought I'd check out Way for lunch.  I was the ONLY one in the restaurant.  The owner/chef/whoever was clearly very busy doing something at the host stand as he was too busy to really acknowledge me coming in.  I asked for the restroom, and even when I came back he barely looked at me. I should have taken this as my hint that perhaps this was just meant to be a bathroom pit stop, but I persisted and asked if I could sit at the sushi bar.  He obliged.  I sat at the sushi bar for a few minutes before he came over and gave me the sushi menu and took my drink order.  I ordered 2 rolls: Fire Roll ($6.95) and the Y-R Roll ($12.95 and very over-priced).  Both spicy rolls, and both decent but not earth-shattering.  I have to give the guy credit for being very attentive after that and bringing me more Diet Coke as soon as I finished the first glass, and he asked me no less than 72 times if the food was good and if I needed anything.    I can't say that I'll be back since I would much rather go to Blue Wasabi down the street at San Tan, but it's not bad if you're in the shopping complex and have a major sushi craving.  :)

Went back here with the hubby one night.  Service was AMAZING and the food was great too.  Although we spent more than we wanted to (some of their rolls are just too pricey), I will be back here.

Happy hour is great, although crowded!  The $3.50 margaritas are no joke - you get 2 of these and you're set for the night.  The $4.50 martinis however are too sweet and not that strong (tried the pomegranate and the classic cosmo) .    The happy hour food specials are great.  Good selection of $3, $4.50, $5 items.  Had a couple of their rolls (spicy tuna and CA roll - boring I know but, hey, they were 3 bucks!), had the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps (very good) and the calamari (also very good until they got kinda cold and rubbery - but when they were hot, they were delish - especially with the spicy sauce they come with!).  Definitely a fan of this place, even though getting a table during happy hour is tricky (but not impossible).  Won't be the last time I come here for happy hour I'm sure.

So although we ended up spending a FORTUNE in this place (didn't go during one of the "specials" nights), I still have to admit I liked the joint.    It's HUGE, very open and bright (not something you usually see for a bar), and I found the servers/bartenders all to be very nice.  Drinks weren't very strong (until I ordered a double), and they literally charge an arm and a leg for drinks and food.  Hubby was drinking the large beers - $7 a pop!!! WHOA.    The vodka drinks were actually cheaper than the large beers.  Ordered the boneless chicken wings - VERY good - but $11.  Yikes.  For an appetizer?  Overall I like the place, but I think we'll check out their calendar before going again to see when they have their specials.  p.s. they have cool VIP rooms ("barns") that we might look into for future parties.  FYI, in case you're looking for a party place for your country-loving friend.

We live in the area and thought we'd give PP a try for a low-key and cheap dinner.  The place was kind of dead, and definitely dark and kind of like a dungeon.  There are however plenty of tv's so makes for good sports watching.    The food was pretty awesome actually - had the turkey burger with brie cheese.  Why haven't I thought of that before?!  It was delish.  Hubby ordered the chicken breast with mashed potatoes and he liked it.  Service was good, except in the 45 minutes or so that we were there, the bartender broke 2 or 3 glasses.  I actually heard one fall and break and she was standing at the other side of the bar... perhaps the place is haunted and explains the "dungeon" feel??    In any case, the place gets a thumbs-up overall however I'm not sure we'll be back since Tailgaters and Uncle Bear's are much higher on the list for sports bars in our area.

Went here to get carne & pollo asado, and I was so pleased!  Everyone is super friendly, most people speak English (and if not, they will go get someone that does), and the prices are terrific.  Will be BBQing the food up tomorrow so we'll see how it is, but I have a feeling it's going to be awesome, and I WILL be back here.

Update - after bbq-ing the chicken and carne - I love this place even more.  It was awesome.  All of our guests loved it too.  A++.  Will definitely be back for their asada.

I wanted to give an update on my review... after the owner of the store found out about my review/rating, she called me & emailed me to apologize for her less than friendly demeanor and explain that she had some personal things going on at the time... I appreciate the follow up and clearly she cares enough about her business to follow up to make sure her customers are happy.  I'll be back if I'm looking for another piece of unique furniture for my home...

This place deserves more stars for their food, but their service was so horrible that I can't bring myself to go higher than 2.  At first, all seemed well.  Quick service for the menu, drinks and soup/eggroll that came with my lunch special ($7 by the way, a great deal for all the food you get).  But after I got my Drunken Noodles (very tasty) , I never saw the waitress again.  Even though I made a point to put my empty glass at the edge of my table, my eyes begging for a refill each time she walked by, but she was just too busy to bother.  I eventually gave up on the hope of getting more soda and finished my meal and again, trying to give a signal that I'm ready for my bill, pushed my empty plate to the edge of the table.  She rushed back and forth a few times and glanced at the empty plate and glass, but still not bothering to stop by.  I eventually got up and walked over to the other waitress at the computer station and told her I wanted to pay.  Very frustrating to say the least.  The food is great but the service ruined the experience for me.  Sadly, I will not be returning here.  You can find me at Thai Rama in Chandler instead.

If I could give this place 6 stars I would. WOW. The food is INCREDIBLE. The best mexican food I've ever had.   I had the chicken quesadilla platter with charro beans and rice. Sounds pretty boring doesn't it? Quite the contrary. This isn't your typical mexican food.   I'm not sure what "Sonora" style means (which is what the guy that took my order told me), but I'm loving it. I want everything "Sonora" style from now on.   The food had so much flavor - it tasted like everything had been simmering for days.   The salsa, OH THE SALSA. They actually brought out 2 different kinds of salsa as well as some guacamole - all tasty, but my favorite and need-to-lick-the-cup-clean-it's-so-delicious salsa was the chunky one with onions and green chilis in it. More please.   I finished every single morsel of food on that plate (which was A LOT!) and for $9 out the door (including a drink), I will absolutely be back here. Maybe tomorrow. And the next day. And the next...

I have tried this yogurt place twice and both times I was actually pretty disappointed.  The yogurt was a little more runny than it should be and the flavors were just OK.  Not too sure I would give them a 3rd chance.  In this case, 2 strikes and you're out.

I was going to give this 3 stars, but since I'm not a true meat-eater (I only eat fish and poultry) I thought I should go a bit easy on the review for this place.    The pros:  Service was awesome.  Prices are reasonable.  Drinks good (had a Grey Goose dirty martini for $6! now that's a deal).  My husband raved about his food (he had 2 different types of sausages as well as the prime rib).  The cons:  The chicken dish was "OK".  Really nothing special, and honestly kind of dry.  Also, the dessert (brownie sundae) wasn't very good - the brownie was cold.  Would have been MUCH better if they had heated it up.  Also, the "trophies" throughout the place (the animals that the owners have hunted) are not to my liking.  Of course, if you don't mind looking at the animals (or should I say, them looking at you) and you love your meat - then this is the place for you.  My husband couldn't get enough of his food - he loved absolutely everything he ordered.  I'm sure we'll be back.  Sigh.

Affordable shots and vet care + caring people, what more do you need?  I've taken my 2 dogs here for their shots and also had one of my dogs spayed here.  2 thumbs up.  Will be back each year for their regular vaccines.

One thing I forgot to mention - although the food was barely "OK", their hot sauce was quite delicious.  Very flavorful and good heat to it.  Yum.  Now if only their food was good enough to put the hot sauce on...

Had a certificate for a mani/pedi combo but I wanted to get a new acrylic set instead of the mani, and they let me do that and just pay the difference. Very nice and accommodating. They weren't too pushy on trying to up-sell me (like many nail salons are), and I appreciated that. The guy that did my pedi and my new set did an AWESOME job, and I'm sure I'll be back. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that their prices seem a little higher than other nail places in the area.

Ok, so I know this is a chain, and well what can be so special about a chain... Well I will tell you.  The turkey burger!  That's what can be so special about a chain.  Seriously, the BEST turkey burger I've ever had is at Red Robin (and trust me, I've had MANY).  If there's a turkey burger on the menu, you can rest assured I will order it, and time and time again, Red Robin is my favorite.  I feel a little ashamed admitting this, since, it is a chain after all.  But seriously, it's so moist and delicious.  No one else can get it right.  It's either tasty and dry or moist and flavor-less, but NOT Red Robin.  It's consistently TASTY and MOIST!  Yes, that's right.  MOIST.  (Should I have given a warning at the beginning of this review that it would be R rated?)  Anyway, if you love turkey burgers as much as I do, get yourself over to a Red Robin pronto, you're welcome. (p.s. get it with cheese, duh)  p.p.s. the reason I knocked it down 1 star is because 1) it's very much a "family" restaurant, which means it's inevitably loud, and 2)  although they have great cocktails like spiked strawberry lemonade, the drinks are kinda pricey considering the lack of sufficient booze to drown out the "loudness" of the surroundings.

The pho is delicious, and the prices are fantastic.  Definitely a hole in the wall and very authentic (not much English spoken here).  Down side is that they don't serve beer (wha?! who doesn't drink beer with their pho?!) but otherwise 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.  Will come here whenever we're on this side of town.

We just moved in down the street so I was super excited to see a Fresh & Easy just blocks from our new home.  I haven't had a F&E store near us in the past but I've heard how great it is - and cheap.  It certainly lives up to the hype.  I absolutely LOVE shopping here!  There's never a crowd, their prices are unbeatable, and the cashiers are friendly and helpful.  They even gave me an item for free tonight because it was ringing up at the wrong price.  I will be shopping here weekly.

Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday due to the rave reviews and that it was supposed to be cheap.  Unfortunately, they only do lunch specials on weekdays (not out of the ordinary I suppose) so my lunch entree was $8 plus my soda so about $14 with tax/tip which I normally wouldn't consider "cheap" for lunch.    BUT, the food was AWESOME.  I had the drunken noodles with tofu.  It was the first time ever that I couldn't eat all the noodles (believe me, I tried).  Huge portion, and very tasty.  I asked for a "medium" spicy and it was perfect - just a little too spicy - just how I like it.  My only complaint about the food was that the tofu was a little too chewy/hard.  I didn't specifically want soft tofu, but they fried it too long in my opinion.  Otherwise, very yummy.  And did I mention that there were a TON of noodles?  Seriously.   I will definitely try to stop in during lunch on a weekday and try something else on their menu.  I have a feeling it will all be good.

Sadly I don't remember the name of the lady that helped me here (Debbie maybe?), but I can't thank her enough!   I was shopping frantically for a cute top to wear out for my husband's birthday that same night and lucky me, I find a clearance top at Macy's that is perfect but one of the buttons needs to be sewn back on. Being completely sewing challenged, I run around the mall trying to find a place that could sew the button on for me. I find Perfect Fit but the lady working, I'll just call her Debbie since I don't remember her name, said she's backed up for over a week. A week?!?!   I ask her if there's any way to get it done today. Right now. In the next 10 minutes. She says a week. I tell her it's my husband's birthday and I'd really like to wear that top that night, does she know of another place I could go in the area? "Say no more, hand it over." I'm elated! Until I notice the "cash only" sign on the wall (since at this point I'm down to some change and only my cards), and she says don't even worry about it - it's my birthday gift to your husband.   WOW! Now that's what I call terrific service! Thank you, thank you Debbie! You're my hero, and I will be back with any and all my alterations in the future!

Full disclosure... I don't "spa" often so I don't have a lot to compare to...  My hubby surprised me with a spa day at Jurlique, including a 60 minute massage, mani & pedi.  I walked into the quaint little reception area and the receptionist was on the phone, but she greeted me when she hung up.  Not overly friendly as I would expect for a spa, but nice enough.  My massage therapist came out a couple minutes after my scheduled time and walked me down the quaint little hall.  Yes, everything is quaint and little.  But I liked it.  There's a cute little "tea reception" area (quaint I might add), with all sorts of interesting tea (had the chocolate mint later in my spa day, was tasty).  The treatment room was very nice.  Had a separate changing area with a private shower, robe, towels, etc.  The massage therapist took some time to chat with me and find out what I liked, etc.  The massage was terrific.  After getting dressed and heading back into the lobby area, the receptionist said I could go into the nail salon.  I walk in, and the nail girl says, literally, without so much as a smile, "Are you my next client?".  Well gee, you didn't have anyone before me, and come to find out she didn't have anyone after me... yes, I'm your next client.  Nice to meet you too.  She never did introduce herself by name or bother to ask for mine.  I was REALLY put off by this considering I was coming from a nice relaxing massage and then, BAM, are you my next client?  Unthoughtful.  Annoying.  Rude even.  She became only slightly more pleasant throughout the mani/pedi, and I could tell she'd rather be anywhere BUT there doing my nails.  I have to say though, she still did a great job (just wasn't happy doing it), and I got an amazing mani/pedi.  Would I get them again?  No way.  Not worth the money to get the attitude.  Overall I give it 4 stars because I think the place is cute and the resort would make for a great stay-cation with the hubby.  I will wait for the summer discounts and come back for seconds (for the massage anyway).  P.S. BONUS - I checked in on foursquare & they were offering 25% off the entire bill, and they honored it!  Score!

WOW. Who knew that going to the dentist could be so cool?  Seriously, I used to hate going to dentists, but Dr. Goates and his staff (and his office!) has changed all that!  First, when I walked into the office, I thought I mistakenly walked into a spa, water bottles and all.    The receptionist was super friendly and greeted me by my first name (apparently they don't jam pack appointments and can keep track of who's coming in, nice touch).  All the staff I dealt with was very nice, friendly and made me feel at ease.  Dr Goates is top notch and really takes time to make sure you're comfortable and answers your questions/concerns.  They have super high tech tools (i.e. xray machine) and also flat screen tvs in most of the rooms.    To top it all off, they make a mold of your teeth and give you free teeth whitening bleach as long as you keep up on your 6 month appointments.  If you're looking for a dentist in the Gilbert area, look NO FURTHER.

Ben is great. He explained things clearly and professionally to my client, and he was very thorough with his inspection.  Great prices too. Too bad I didn't check here first though for the discount - could have received $44 off!

After a late night out on Halloween Eve, hubby and I were craving some tasty, cheesy Mexican goodness, and we luckily found this new Filiberto's.   My standby is the shredded chicken burrito, and it was actually a bit dry at this location (usually it's very "saucy" and delicious). But thank goodness for their hot sauce. It's not like the typical fast food Mexican restaurant hot sauces - it's actually got FLAVOR. I go through like 4-5 of the little cups of it. That will make even the driest burrito "saucy" and it certainly did the trick that night. Yum.   I'll be back I'm sure.

I love Ling & Louie's.  Their food is SO good.  Hubby and I eat here A LOT.  I've tried a few different things but always come back to the Sizzling Chicken & Shrimp skillet.  Oh so tasty.  The fried rice is REALLY tasty, but I've been trying to eat healthier and have been getting the brown rice which is always fluffy and good.  We've always eaten at the bar and have had great service.  The only reason I knocked it down a star is because it's a little pricey.  But still worth it...

Location is awesome, great view & great people watching on the strip.  But that's where the positive ends.  Don't go here for the food.  Even after not eating all day and being drunk and starving, the food was still horrible - bland, dry, just overall bad (got the chicken burrito per the waitress's recommendation).    I would only go back for drinks on the patio... take your money elsewhere if you actually want to eat good food.

"Meh" is definitely the appropriate comment for this place.  The food was OK at best.  The best thing I had was the beans and hot sauce.  I ordered a shredded chicken burrito combo.  Although I was happy to see that the burrito wasn't bigger than my head (seriously, why do places serve such HUGE burritos?), I wasn't happy with much else.  The chicken was watery (literally - I cut into the burrito and water oozed out - gross) and didn't have much flavor.  The rice was bland.  The beans were tasty, especially with LOTS of hot sauce/salsa on them.  Can't say I'll be coming back.  I'll be looking for some burros elsewhere, thank you very much.

I really love this place.  I love their happy hour - you get a little appetizer on the house as well as a little dessert at the end!  The bean dip and salsa are AWESOME.  The sangria is VERY good, although it is a little too sweet sometimes.  Everything I've ordered here has always been delicious.    Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service can be kind of slow/spotty at times.  Otherwise I love me some El Palacio.

What a little gem in Gilbert! Didn't even know it was there until a friend invited me out to meet her there for "80's Night" of all things. 80's night at a wine bar? A DJ at a wine bar? But it all worked, and I really dig the place.   Servers and bartender were all super friendly, met the owners who were also nice, bartender gave me a free glass of wine, and overall just had a really nice time.   Looking forward to their $20 tastings on Fridays. Sounds like an awesome deal (4 or 5 glasses plus an appetizer)! Oh yeah - and they have Yappy Hour/Brunch where you can bring your pooch (check their calendar). Awesome. Will be back here for sure.

Wow, what a disappointing experience. Service was slow (although friendly), and the food was meh at best.    Stopped in for lunch, had the lunch combo which included soup & a spring roll. The soup was good, nothing else was. The spring roll was cold, and the eggplant/chicken I had was bland (literally, the only flavor it had was the soy sauce and sriracha I kept pouring on it to give it some flavor - I ordered it a medium spicy by the way) & the chicken was overcooked.  Will not be back.

Car won't start.  Crap.  Praying it's just the battery and not something more serious.  Wait for DH to get back home so he can jump start me.  I make it to the nearest auto shop, Auto Zone.  Anita is the one in the store helping everyone and their mother, cousin and great-uncle.  Seriously, the woman had a store full of people but managed to acknowledge everyone and guide them in the right direction or start to look up whatever they needed.  In my case, she grabs a battery tester as well as another customer's windshield wipers (which she will be installing for the guy!) and asks us both to follow her out the door.  She tests my battery and confirms that it does in fact need to be replaced (phew!).  As we head back into the store, she comments that she noticed the battery is a Checker Auto battery and do I know if there's still a warranty on it.  Huh?  No clue.  She proceeds by calling the Checker across the street and asking them to look me up in their system.  After much searching they finally find me in the CA database as I apparently bought the battery in San Diego (huh? still no recollection, but ok).  She hangs up and tells me that if I go across the street to get my battery they will give me a prorated rebate on the old battery.  That prorated rebate - ALMOST 50 BUCKS!  So THANK YOU ANITA! Thank you for going way above and beyond the level of service I would expect at an auto shop, and thank you for saving me so much money.  I will certainly be back to give you my business in the future.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review?!  I absolutely LOVE Gilbert Dogs!  The staff is great, the Facebook videos are AWESOME, and our dog Cayla always comes home happy and exhausted.  Love the fact that we can drop off or pick up at any time of day or night.  Love, love, love this place.  We drive 20+ minutes out of the way to take our dog here, and it's SO worth it!

So I've lived in the area for about 6 months now and drive by Port of Subs on a daily basis as I get off the freeway.  Never really thought to stop in because I thought it would be the same ol' sub chain type place you're used to like Subway, etc and I'm not really a fan of the chain sandwich places.  However, I came to find out that this is Subway kicked up a notch!  First, I was VERY pleased to see the sticker in the window that they have a new tuna melt griller sandwich.  YUM.  That's exactly what I wanted, and it's exactly what I got.  It was quite tasty.  I'm not sure what the cheese was, but it was delish.  Plenty of tuna and put on all the fixins I wanted (like jalapenos, mmm, my mouth is watering).  I loved that they had a "medium" option (small = 5 inches, medium = 8, large = 12).  The line was HUGE and since this place isn't really convenient to get into (kind of an akward spot right off the freeway) I'm assuming that all their sandwiches are tasty to get that many people lining up for them.  Hubby got a cold sandwich (turkey & pastrami I think?) and liked it too.  Now that I know I can get tasty wiches here, I'll be a regular here for sure.  Only complaint, a "little" pricey for a sub (like $6-7 for a medium) but I think it was still worth it.  p.s. they have breakfast sandwiches!  Interesting...

What can I say, I love bargains.  It's usually hit or miss with dollar stores but I am consistently pleased with the products, service and cleanliness and this Dollar Tree.  I'm almost always greeted when I walk in the door, the merchandise is neat and tidy (not strewn around like some dollar stores), and the inventory is great. 2 thumbs up in my book of cheap places to get your everyday items as well as decorations/seasonal items.

Went here based on a friend's recommendation for their pollo and carne asada.  Unfortunately, when I got there they were almost out of pollo and the few pieces they had left looked dry and pretty gross actually (like the meat was being kept cold).    The carne looked decent so I got 2 pounds of it.  Knowing that I'd have to make another stop (since they didn't have pollo I'd be going to Food City where I normally get all my asada), I asked the guy to put the bag of carne in another bag of ice to keep it cold in the car (it's like 110 degrees outside).  Get home to find out he put the ice IN the bag with the meat... which means the meat got all watered down and as I dumped the water out, I was also dumping out all the seasoning.  How could he have possibly thought that was a good idea??  We'll be grilling up the meat this weekend so the verdict is out how good it will be, but for $6.50/lb I can't imagine that this watered down season-less carne asada will be comparable at all to the carne from Food City.  Do yourself a favor, if in the area for some good carne or pollo asado, go a mile down the road to Food City on Arizona Ave.

As much as I dislike working out, there isn't anything I dislike about this gym!!!  The adage, "you get what you pay for" really holds true here.    Yes the membership is on the expensive side (but they have awesome specials!), it's worth every penny for the personalized attention you get (even in group classes - average class size whenever I go is about 5 people!) and the high level of training you get.  The workouts are fun and varied and super challenging - there has not been a single workout that I haven't been sore the next day.    I love walking in and being greeted by my first name, not like when you walk into a mega-gym and you're simply one of the thousands of faces that walk through the door each day.  All the trainers and even the owners make a point to learn everyone's name and get to know you.  The trainers are constantly working to improve their skills and learn new things to keep the workouts interesting and fresh.  They also discuss nutrition and focus on the overall process of being/getting healthy and fit.  If you're looking for something fun & different other than the treadmill or elliptical and especially if you're looking for one-on-one training with a trainer that will work you hard and help you with YOUR specific goals - this is the place for you.

Capping off my less than stellar visit to Thai Spice down the hall, iTwist Yogurt continued the trend.  They normally only  have 6 flavors, but today 1 was out and only had 5.  Out of the 5, 2 were vanilla/chocolate & then 3 tart flavors which all sounded about the same and not particularly appealing.  I went with vanilla & chocolate... chocolate came out weird at first but then was OK & tasted fine.  Vanilla had a weird flavor & color to it and I didn't eat it.  Toppings were limited - not even close to the selection you see in most other yogurt places.  After being closed the first time I tried to come here, and then the lackluster experience when they were actually open, I don't think I'll be giving them a 3rd try.

Was lucky enough to get a coupon deal for this place, and I'm so glad I did!  I got a groupon-type deal for partial highlights, cut, and deep condition with Juli.  I left the salon leaving with silky soft hair and bright new highlites.  Juli was GREAT, and I'll be going back in the future.  Their normal prices are reasonable, better than most places I have found & although I live in Gilbert, it will be worth the drive to go here to see Juli.

This place is RIDIC.  I crave the shrimp boil here like nothing else I have ever craved.  The most amazing flavor. Go hungry because it's a lot of food & you will want to eat every last bite, lick the bowl clean even, it's so good.  If you've never had a seafood boil, it's basically a delicious stew with all sorts of delicious spicy goodness.  OMGawd I want some right now...   Seriously, if you love seafood, this is a MUST try.  If you don't love seafood, get over your non-seafood-loving ways and just go.

I've been here a handful of times, usually for dinner but today I went for lunch.  I expected the lunch buffet to be inexpensive because the dinner buffet is only $9.99 (what what?! yes, please!), but the lunch buffet is $8.99 (not as exciting, boo).  Nevertheless, the food is always delicious, the service always fantastic, and it's one of my fave Indian places I've been to.    Will probably stick to the dinner buffet though because I'm not that keen on spending $14 on lunch (for buffet, Diet Coke & tip) and then being way-too-full the rest of the day because I couldn't stop eating all the deliciousness.

Stopped in for a couple drinks and to pick up dinner to go.  Sat at the bar - bartender was friendly and poured decent drinks. Ordered the mac n cheese (no chicken or meat, just the green chilis), and it was RIDICULOUS. So freakin' good.  I dream about that mac n cheese now... wish I lived closer. Except I'd get it every week and my heart & cholesterol would not appreciate that.

Stopped in for a quick lunch during the week based on the good reviews of the place.  Service was quick and friendly. Ordered a lunch combo (spicy noodle?) with tofu.  The soup that came with it was a little sad... it was about 2 spoonfuls, no kidding.    Rest of the food came quickly and looked much more promising than the soup, however I took a bite of the spring roll and immediately realized that this would NOT be my #1 thai place, nor #52 on the list.  The spring roll was cold (yes, cold, not even lukewarm) and so was some of the tofu throughout the dish.  The dish itself had good flavor, but the random cold pieces of tofu were a turn off to say the least.  Disappointing meal & I won't be returning.

My pho of choice is chicken, and the chicken pho at this place had an unusual flavor - kind of sweet.  But otherwise, not much other flavor.  I had to keep adding soy sauce & sriracha but overall a disappointing meal.  I won't be back.

Dang it, missed a FTR opportunity.  Kudos to Kirstin!  Got a Groupon for this place a while back and stopped in when in the area.  The lady working was SUPER friendly and sweet and you could tell she really loved the job.   She had me taste all sorts of oils and vinegars (even giving me some recipe ideas as I tried them!) and helped me pick out a great bottle to take home.  I wish I lived closer to this area so I could visit more often.  I highly recommend this place, and it's great if you're looking for a unique gift or a special oil or vinegar for a recipe.

Rocky Road Bread Pudding.  Need I say more??  No really. That should be the end of my review.  Because that's all you need to know.  That they have Rocky Road Bread Pudding.  And it's DELICIOUS.  I've also had their sandwiches (WHOA food - no kidding, a sandwich can feed 2 people easily - they're huge) along with their homemade chips (yum!), and also I have had a pasta chicken dish that was tasty as well (not fireworks status but tasty nonetheless).  Their coffee is spectacular (read: strong) as is their red sangria (don't worry, didn't try them at the same time).  Overall I love this place.  Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because their homemade chips aren't consistent - sometimes REALLY good, sometimes just "meh".  When in the area you must stop in.  Don't forget to try their bread pudding!!

Took hubby here for his birthday (he had been before & was his choice). I told the cashier (who might also be the owner/manager?) that we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday & she offered to bring out a dessert at the end of our meal. Nice!   We ordered the greek fries (tasty & different!), and I had the chicken souvlaki pita.  It was good but I found the chicken a little dry. They brought out the complimentary dessert (baklava) which my husband is a huge fan of.  Their espresso machine wasn't working so they let me go down to Starbucks a few doors down to bring back coffees for the dessert.   They have a full bar set up, might come back for dinner one night.

If I could give this place zero stars I would. VERY disappointed, and I will NEVER return - at least not while it's under the current ownership.   Went here a few days after it reopened as Thirsty Cactus. Was immediately disappointed to see that they took down all the cute dog pics. Sure I get it that it's a new owner, new name, new theme (although, what theme?) but they didn't do anything to replace the dog pics. The walls are painted hideous purple, yellow and other bright colors that would be much better suited for a preschool.   Service was fine, nothing special. Food was OK, nothing special. Prices were less than fine or OK - they're over priced. Although first impression wasn't stellar, we didn't hate it.   We decided to go back for a 2nd trip with our dogs - wanted to relax on the patio. We sat down and our asses barely hit the bench when the server came over to tell us that they didn't have a "license" anymore to allow dogs on the patio. Really? A license?? I'd like to know what license that would be? Is that the license to be a cool establishment and allow calm dogs chill out on the patio? Is that the license that they chose not to pay for?   I'm thinking there is no license, and even if there is, perhaps the owner should have considered that the customers that come here like to occasionally bring their four-legged friends with them.   I will not be back, and I imagine I won't be the only one. Looking forward to the next owner taking over the place... I imagine it won't take too long.

Wow, surprised by the previous reviews, and I'm glad I didn't read them before going.    I was driving by and was starved so stopped here for a quick lunch.  I'm currently trying the no/low-carb thing so I ordered their sashimi lunch combo, which was supposed to be 9 pcs of sashimi plus a CA roll.  I asked if they could sub 2 more pcs of sashimi instead of the roll and they had no problem with it.  The fish was fresh and tasty.  The miso soup it came with was also good.  The ice tea I had was good as well.  All in all, a great stop, and I would come again if I were in the area.

Ugh, I don't know why I tried this place.  I've been to one other European Wax Center, and it was a horrible experience and I was hoping it was just a fluke.  After today, I'm never going back to any of their locations.  First, I will say that the aesthetician working on me today was VERY nice and although it was her first week, she was speedy and knew exactly what she was doing.  I think she'll do great.  (quite the opposite of my experience at the other location, where the girl didn't even close the door to our room initially - and I was getting a brazilian! WTF?).  My problem with this place is the wax (I think).  I had my underarms and lower legs waxed, and much of the hair is still there.  When I go through the pain of waxing, I expect to come away with silky smooth skin, and that is not the case with European Wax Center (I have gone to many other salons for waxing and always leave with smooth hair-free skin!).  It was the same thing last time I went (at a different location- on Val Vista), so at this point I'm assuming it's the product they use.  Disappointing to say the least.

My second time at Green (the first time at their Scottsdale location).  I tried the Diablo bowl with crispy tofu and noodles.  Great flavor and LOTS of tasty veggies (eggplant, broccoli, peppers, onions, carrots, zucchini) but lacking in noodles.  Still left full and satisfied though.    Was disappointed that they only have bottled teas/juices and no soda (Scottsdale location has a soda fountain).  I'm not even that big on soda, but I have one Diet Coke with my lunch each day so if it's not available - or heaven forbid, Pepsi products only - then I get disappointed.  Overall, a tasty meal, and I look forward to trying other items on their menu.

Came here because I had gone to the other North (in Kierland) just a few days prior and had such a good meal that I had to return.  The mushroom pizza ("funghi" to be exact) which was AH-mazing at the other location, but here it was a little dry... not as much cheesy mushroom-y goodness.  Was a little disappointed needless to say since I had been craving that pizza from the moment I licked the plate clean at Kierland.   The service was terrific though, we sat at the bar (wish I remembered the bartender's name). Drinks were good & strong and the ambiance was great, so I would still come to this one if in the area, but I'll make the extra drive to the more "north" North for my funghi fix.

I can't say enough about Chandler Dogs!  We first started taking our husky-mix, Cayla, to their original location, Gilbert Dogs, and we were very happy when this location opened!    It's HUGE with separate rooms for the big dogs, the small dogs, and the "just chillin" dogs.  I love that the facility is kennel free and it's available to drop off or pick up your dog 24 hours a day (just call ahead so they know when to expect you!).  Everyone is great & really cares about the dogs, and they give you a "report card" at the end of their visit.  And our absolute favorite thing is that they take videos of the dogs & post them to Facebook so even when we're away on vacation we can see what our sweet Cayla is up to.  P.S. they're not just for boarding- you can also drop off your pooch for "daycare" or a dog park field trip too!  5 enthusiastic stars.  Hope our Cayla sees your pooch there soon!

Got a coupon deal for a 60 minute massage here, CHEAP, so I didn't mind that it's a student clinic.  The spa is located inside the Pima Medical Institute so not very fancy, but the suite itself is decorated nicely and looks very much like a "real" spa.  I was greeted by a friendly receptionist, filled out paperwork and was soon met by my massage student.    She was friendly (although you could tell she was a student, just a little too shy/timid) and once in the private room, she asked me the typical massage questions... are there certain areas I want work on, what kind of pressure, etc.  She listened to me and checked in a few times during the massage to make sure I was happy.  The massage was great.  The music (your typical spa music) cut out a few times so it was kind of awkward silence every now and then, but otherwise I was very pleased with the entire experience.  Can't beat the prices ($25 for 60 minutes or $35 for 90 minutes), and I think I'll be back in the future, but get the 90 minutes next time.

I've been here twice.  First time, they had a hand-written sign on the door that they were closed for a few hours (in the middle of a business day when normally they would be open).  Second time they were actually open. The service was good, very friendly and the server gave me a miso soup on the house.  But the positive ends there unfortunately.  The miso soup, was less than stellar.  I noticed on the menu they charge $3 for it.  I would maybe pay $1 for it.  Not much flavor at all, probably one of the most bland miso soups I've had.  I ordered the lunch roll combo which was a great deal, $7.50, for 4 pieces each of CA roll, spicy tuna, and spicy salmon.  The price was good, but you get what you pay for.  There was very little fish in any of the rolls.  They were very generous with the cucumber and rice though! :/   Maybe the regular rolls are better, but I think I will pass on this place in the future.

Stopped in to see 2nd half of a football game and was VERY pleasantly surprised! Awesome space (it's HUGE!) and plenty of TVs everywhere. Service was super fast and friendly, and their menu looks great (looking forward to trying their food next time!).  Only downside was that a Smirnoff vodka was $8.50 (WHAT?!). For Smirnoff??  Seriously people, we're not in Manhattan, we're in Mesa. Let's price the drinks appropriately.  Otherwise 2 thumbs up.

Great yogurt but lacking in the toppings department. Also not as many yogurt flavor options as most other yogurt shops.  However, a good stop if you're in the area and craving frozen yogurt.

I left this review on the restaurant, El Taco de Chandler, but apparently they have a new name so here it is on the new/correct name... :)  I REALLY want to give this place 5 stars but due to the service I simply cannot.  But the food was AH-mazing.  Some of the best chicken I've ever had.    Had the chicken burrito combo, and although the rice and beans were just OK, I thought I might cry right into my platter because the chicken burrito was so delicious.  The chicken was so tender and juicy... ohmygawd I am drooling just thinking about it, and I am still overwhelmingly full from the meal.  The burrito also had onions (both white and green) and cilantro (YES PLEASE!) which I'm sure added to the overall deliciousness.    Sadly the service was less than stellar and SUPER slow (and I was the ONLY one in the restaurant so no excuses), but their food (and cheap prices!) will certainly get me coming back.  Nom nom nom.

Went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night.  Got there about 9:30p and it was pretty empty.  Sat at the bar and although the bartender was pretty quick to serve us, she wasn't the friendliest bartender I've ever encountered and there was something "off" with my drinks.  I was drinking vodka/sodas and they had a funny taste to them, almost like maybe there was something in the glass (cleaning residue or something?).  Bartender re-used my glass and it was less prevalent the second drink...  Wasn't overly impressed with the place until I got my shrimp pho... which was PHO-ntastic!  The broth was very good & there was plenty of it (I ordered the large because I LOVE me some broth!!!)  The pho was some of the best I had, and if the bartender had been a little more friendly and my drinks didn't have a funny taste, this would be an easy 5 star review.  The owner did greet us and even took pics of our group for the birthday girl, so that bumps it up to 4 1/2 stars.    I will definitely be coming back when I need my pho-fix!

I LOVE this place! The yogurt is delicious & they have Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory toppings! Need I say more??   Only negative I can think of is that the toppings in the back row are VERY difficult to reach (I noticed I wasn't the only one struggling to reach them) - they should change the cover or something to make it more accessible.   But other than that, 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.  I will be visiting this place very frequently this summer.  I would move in if they let me.

Awesome service, tasty food, strong margaritas, what more could you ask for?  We had the chicken quesadilla to start, and I had the chicken tortilla soup.  I did have to add salt to the soup and also threw in some salsa to kick it up a notch on the spice factor, but overall 2 thumbs up.  We'll likely be back.

Over the last 3 years we've lived in the area, this place has changed 4 times.  First Uncle Bear's, then Tio Oso's, then Thirsty Cactus (or Thirsty Cantina, whatever, it sucked), and now it's TC's Pub & Grub.  The menu is typical bar food, including burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings as well as some taco and quesadilla selections (which I always appreciate a good quesadilla so I will have to try it next time).   The restaurant section (which was always dead before) has now been opened up and TVs added so the whole place is more of a bar feel (thumbs up).  The place was packed for Thursday night football (Cardinal's game!), but still got a good table close to a TV.    Server (who admitted multiple times he was brand new) was very friendly but had to keep asking other servers for clarification on menu, etc.  Still, nice enough and very attentive.  We ordered wings ("medium" but they were spicy!) and their "ugly" crust pizza with mushrooms and olives.  The wings, very good, I would get them again.  Pizza, I wouldn't order it again if someone paid me.  The "ugly" crust basically is a thick hand tossed crust - too much crust (and half of it was burned) and very skimpy on the toppings.  It was pretty horrible honestly.  The actual toppings (although sparse) were very tasty... good cheese and fresh mushrooms and olives, so I would order pizza here again IF they have a thinner crust option.  Otherwise, if you are coming here to carb load and really need your bread fix, by all means, order the pizza.  I personally prefer a thinner NY style crust.  All in all I would come here again based on the good wings and service, and I'm looking forward to trying their other menu options.   p.s. text TCSPUB to 411247 and they'll send you a text coupon for a 50 cent draft. Score! (I'm a sucker for a deal)  Cheers!

Oh Gordo's.  I was SO excited when I saw the sign go up that they would be opening, that I would drive by every few days to check to see if they were open yet.  FINALLY, they were open, and I couldn't wait to try them out.  Well, I have now been twice, and both times have been really disappointed.  Sigh.  Here are my experiences:  Visit 1:  A couple days after they opened (so I was keeping an open mind & hoping they would "settle" into a groove and improve).  I asked the cashier guy what was good.  He recommended the pollo fundido burrito, which I happily ordered because you can never go wrong with that (or so I thought).  Also ordered a cheese quesadilla and a bean/cheese burrito (my husband and my "staples" at any mexican restaurant because it's a good way to compare apples to apples, or, burritos to burritos in this case).  Pollo fundido burrito: NOT worth what they charge, which is astronomical, something like $8 or $9 and it's just the burrito, no beans/rice or anything on the side.  The sauce on the top was really kind of sad.  Not much sauce first of all, and nothing to write home about that's for sure.  I literally felt like I was robbed by ordering this burrito.  Robbed of my money and robbed of my love for mexican food.  Just such a disappointing burrito.    Bean/cheese burrito: MEH. Perhaps if they would have actually put some cheese in that bad boy it would have been good.  But the sprinkling of cheese (even though they charged extra for it) left something to be desired.  Quesadilla: double meh.  Were they having a cheese shortage this night??  You would have thought so from the quesadilla.  Come on people, that's all there is in a quesadilla!  CHEESE!  How about you add some next time?!  One of the driest quesadillas I've had.  How can you screw up a quesadilla??    Hot sauces: the red tastes more like a spicy marinara than a taco hot sauce.  Seriously, I would expect it to be on a pizza, not a burrito.  The green sauce was actually quite good.  All in all, a disappointment to say the least (my husband concurs on all of the above by the way!), but I was hopeful that it will just take a little time to get things running smoothly, etc.  Visit 2 (about a week later):  Used the drive thru, which you can't actually order until you get to the window, FYI.  I sat at the window for a while before someone noticed me (the owner or manager I believe).  He told me he'd be with me in a minute, and came back again a little while later to take my order.  I ordered the shredded beef burrito combo plate but substituted shredded chicken instead.  I was asked to pull around to the front & he would bring me my food.  No biggie.  Got my food 5-10 minutes later (not ideal if you're in a hurry, but I wasn't so I didn't mind).  Got home and again, disappointment set in as I started to eat.  This was literally the worst and driest chicken burrito I've ever had in my life. ZERO flavor, ZERO moisture, just simply a bad burrito.  The beans and rice were, well, beans and rice.  Nothing special, and a mediocre serving (especially the beans, perhaps there was a bean shortage this day?).  The combo was $8 and once again, I felt this was over priced for what I got (the portion, but more importantly the lack of flavor).  The red hot sauce seemed to be a "little" more like hot sauce instead of marinara sauce, but otherwise they have A LOT of work to do if they want to stay in business for the long term.  I'm really hoping and pulling for them, because honestly, we NEED a good fast mexican food joint in this area, but right now I can't imagine going back there anytime soon (if ever).  I would much rather make the 20 minute round trip drive to Filiberto's than try this place again.  So so very sad.  :(  I hope they improve over time, I really do.  Fingers crossed.

I am really happy to write this updated review, and I'm glad I went back to give them another chance! The food has improved significantly since last year, and I'm in love with their red salsa/hot sauce (although I wish they would fill up the little cups they serve them in so I don't have to ask for a million of them).    Prices are a little high compared to other similar places, but for the convenience/location next to my neighborhood it's worth it. Oh, and by the way, the tortillas are awesome.   Way to go Gordo's!

Wow, surprised by the less than stellar reviews recently.  Went here for lunch a couple weeks ago, and I LOVED it.  Service was great, and the food was SO GOOD!  (and cheap since it was lunch hours)  I will absolutely be back here.  I wish they delivered!

I like the great selection/variety of choices, and  I am down for good soup anytime of year, even when it's 110+ degrees outside.  I had the mushroom soup (based on employee's recommendation), and it was delicious!  Would definitely get it again.  The sandwich on the other left MUCH to be desired.  When I first saw it, I literally thought they made a mistake and gave me a kids' combo or something because the sandwich looked like something my mom would make in one of those sandwich press machines back in the 80's.  No kidding.  The sandwich didn't have much on it, and it didn't have much flavor.  Very over-priced for what I got.  I would probably just stop in for a bowl of soup in the future or maybe try a salad next time, but I won't be duped into another one of their sandwiches, sorry.

Hmm, apparently I'm in the minority with my review here but I was less than impressed.   Stopped in for lunch for pho ga (chicken pho).  Ordered a Diet Coke to drink.  Diet Coke was flat, I tried to let the server know that they needed to check the carbonation but she wasn't understanding me so I told her I would have water instead.  Pho came out quickly.  I asked for 1) a spoon (yes, need a spoon for the broth, thanks), 2) for cilantro and onions.  I got what would amount to about 1 sprig of cilantro and some green onions.  Realized after I got the smidgen of cilantro that they hadn't served the side of sprouts, basil, jalapenos, etc on the side... At this point I will just have to make do.  Younger server came to check on me so I ask her for more cilantro as well as jalapenos/limes (which would normally have already been served on the side).  She explains that they don't bring the veggies with the "chicken noodle soup" because there are already veggies in the soup and most people don't eat the sprouts, etc.  Fair enough, I usually don't eat the sprouts either, but I always use the limes and jalapenos and lots of cilantro so please bring me some, thank you.  Out she comes with more cilantro (more than a sprig which was nice) and jalapenos.  No lime though.  I've given up at this point and used the lime from my water.  After adding the cilantro, jalapeno and watery lime, the pho was much better (pretty bland otherwise) and it satisfied my pho craving, but can't say that I'll be back in the future, at least not for pho.    I know this is a lot of detail and maybe sounds a little picky for just a bowl of soup, but honestly, pho is not that complicated and certain things are just standard and they didn't deliver those "standards" here.  The decor was very nice and the second server really did try to make me happy, but all in all there other places I much prefer.

Went for the lunch buffet.  Nice decor, and really lovely dishes and set up for the buffet.  The server was friendly and quick to bring me my water.  Sadly the positives end there.  The options for the food weren't anything to get excited about, with many of the hot dishes sitting empty.  The butter chicken I had was tasty, but the chicken tikka was dry (they used chicken breast).  Also, they had a delicious zucchini dish but it was barely lukewarm when it should have been hot.  The garlic naan was very good but it took a long time for them to bring it to the table (I appreciate that they want to make it fresh but when you're half way through your meal by the time it comes it's a little too slow).  The shocker came with the bill.  $10.99 for the lunch buffet.  Really?  For limited options and not that amazing of food, kind of a disappointment.  There are plenty of really awesome Indian lunch buffets that are $8.99 that I will be going to instead (I know it's only $2 but it just wasn't that great). Meh.

I came here for 3 or 4 days in a row during our first week in our new home - we didn't have internet set up yet and I had to work.  So I brought in my laptop got some coffee and set up my little mobile office.  Great coffee and great environment, and the free wireless internet is a bonus.  I also like the free samples as you come in!  Lol.  I'm sure I'll be popping in here again in the future when I'm shopping at the mall.

So excited for another Mexican food place to open in my hood. Coke products, check. Awesome salsa/hot sauce, check. Tasty bean & cheese burritos & quesadillas, check. Hubby is loving the variety of their menu, which includes lengua tacos & meatball soup (as you can probably tell, he's a little more adventurous with his food than I am), and he loved both. The prices are a little high IMHO, but otherwise 2 thumbs up.

I always love checking out new pho places, and this one did not disappoint.  Service was great and the pho was tasty. I didn't see an option on the menu to get extra broth and I didn't ask, but as we were leaving I noticed they had different sized bowls displayed on the counter, assuming it was the different sizes you could order. Wish I had known so I could order a larger size, but at least now I know for next time.  I will be back.

Stopped in for lunch after getting my nails done next door.  Late lunch, like 2pm, so the place was pretty dead. But I didn't mind. Sat at the bar, had 2 different servers/bartenders help me, and both were friendly and attentive.  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and garlic fries based on recommendation from the bartender. Very good, although I had garlic breath the rest of the day. My fault for ordering garlic at lunch. I had a couple drinks (don't judge) and they were good, not super strong but not just water either (I ordered vodka/soda). 2 thumbs up, and I will definitely be back. Their menu has A LOT of really good looking things on it that I want to try.

Stopped in for lunch during their opening week. Whoa, not sure I've ever seen (or thought possible) a sandwich place to be so busy. Waited patiently in line to order, got the turkey artichoke I believe, on focaccia and also the tomato soup.  I got VERY lucky and snagged a table that was still dirty but since it was the only one in the entire place I didn't care.  I got the food quicker than I expected considering how busy it was.  The sandwich had good flavor, but I wish there was more to it.  It was more bread than anything else.  The chips that came with it, or that were supposed to come with it, were just crumbs mixed with cheese.  I wondered if this is what they were supposed to be like, but looked around and saw people eating actual chips so I figured I just got the bag of crumbs at the bottom of the barrel. :(  Also the soup was just OK.  I loved the little retail section which has a lot of cute, unique items for sale (which could be dangerous while waiting for your food!).  The service was friendly, and I think I will give them another chance in hopes that they just need to work out some kinks after the initial opening.

Friendly service and SO FAST!  I went in to have my foggy headlights buffed out, and I was in and out in no time at all and my headlights literally look brand new.  The lobby/office is really nice with comfy chairs, cold AC and cold water (much needed in our summer months, ugh). The owners Jason and Kristina really care about the business and their customers. So excited to have an honest and reliable auto shop in the area.
