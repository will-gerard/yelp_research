I would recommend Jim Laubham and his staff to anybody looking for a CPA. He was initially recommended by my financial planner (Brice Whilloghby- also awesome). At the time I was with another CPA and had no complaints. I was a little tentative because the cost was a bit higher and I don't usually make a change if I don't have a problem in the first place. Little did I know what a difference a great CPA can make, and how much money can be saved. First of all he is a blast to work with. A meeting with him is never dull. He knows what he is doing when it comes to accounting, especially when it comes to my small business. He has helped me make many decisions including implementing a 401k with a match for my staff and has never led me in the wrong direction. I am able to offer my employees better benefits and it somehow saves me money. My old CPA never mentioned these ideas. Capital accounting goes above and beyond for his clients in ways you typically just don't see. Thank you Jim, James, Rachel, Gina, Bat and everybody else at capital accounting.

I think this is a great local sandwich shop. Quiznos always makes great sandwiches but the owners and staff make this location special.

I can't thank Dr. Mott enough for taking care of my shiba inu after a terrible situation. My dog was brutally attacked by my larger dog last Thursday. He had very substantial injuries to his neck and has needed surgery, pain management and daily evaluations. She worked on him all through the weekend and even have us her cell phone number, when she finally got a day off on Wednesday. Thank you so much for the great work you have done for him. He is resting comfortably now and we are on the road to recovery.

I can't say enough amazing things about this restaurant, the service and most importantly the talent of chef Ron Diemas (hopefully I got that right). I was fortunate enough to be gifted with a Package won in a silent auction from the march of dimes. The package included a 2 night stay at the resort, a 90 minute couples massage and a $50 gift card. We figured we would book dinner at Orange Sky and use the gift card toward the dinner. When we showed up they informed us that we would be having a one of a kind, off menu experience as part of our package. It turned out to be a 7 course meal paired with wine at each course. We are adventurous and love to try new things, so we were super excited. Each course was better than the next. The wine was beautifully paired.  Above all, the food was outstanding. I have eaten at a lot of ravely reviewed restaurants and I would have to say, this was the BEST meal I have ever eaten. Complements to the chef!! A big thank you to our server (Wes...I think?.....you gave us a LOT of wine) and a thank you to Orange sky/ the talking stick for supporting the March of Dimes by offering such an amazing package. Also, I have to thank the best CPA ever, Jim Laubham (capital accounting Ahwatukee), for this amazing gift. If you win it again next year, I highly recommend you keep it for yourself!

Cox communications sucks! Can anybody do their job correctly these days? For the past 4 months we have been getting past due bills for bills we paid through chase online bill pay. I spend hours on the phone each month with a rep explaining the issue over and over again. They then direct me to the receivables department, who has had me send the SAME proof of payment stubs from my online bill pay account 4 times. I even received an email saying the issue was resolved. Yesterday I get an email saying (even though they have the chase online bill pay prof of payments, which shows the cox stamp on the back of the check) they need copies of fronts and backs of the check to resolve the problem. This is online bill pay. I don't have an actual check!! Today our phone and Internet service was disconnected. We unforward our phones at 6:30. Their business department doesn't even open until 8:00. #Fcoxcomminications #bunchofidiots
