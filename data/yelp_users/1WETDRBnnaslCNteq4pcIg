The desire to bring my mom here is damn near overwhelming.  Victorian antiques, kitschy decorations, and brocade wallpaper - and did i mention fantastic scones with Devonshire cream?  I'm not even a girly girl (look for me slurping Irish breakfast tea in a Dramarama t-shirt), but I just can't help feeling frilly and feminine in this place.  Spot on, my good man (translation: 'aw, hell yeah', for those less pasty).

I've been to each of the three locations and I always leave even more certain that Havana Cafe has earned its spot on my top ten favorite restaurants in Phoenix list.  First time you go, go for tapas - it's a wonderful way to try a little of everything.  And if you have the opportunity to order ANYTHING that comes with banana guava ketchup, DO IT.  I typically dont even like ketchup but... wow.

Since my first appointment with Brandi three years ago, I won't let anyone else near my hair.  Best highlights ever, and great cuts from short to long and back again.  I have recurring goth phases too, so I appreciate that she doesn't condemn me for being a child of the 80s.  ;o)  The place is friendly and hip and pretty competitive in their pricing, considering that it gets such rave reviews.  I can't help but notice the lack of haughtiness.  This is a milder version of swank.  Everyone's really friendly (they even feed me tea & cookies), and when I was finally brave enough to treat my hopelessly imperfect body to that first bikini wax, I was really glad I did it here.  Highly recommended!

if you've never paid a big athletic guy to play your body like a xylophone (and i mean OUTSIDE of vegas), consider that you may be overdue.    dr. nemanic is what a chiropractor should be - accurate, friendly, easygoing, and efficient without ever making me feel like i'm the last thing he needs to accomplish before a round of golf.  and he doesn't depend solely on the big pressure-relieving moments of "CRRRRACK" (wonderful as they are).  in fact, the most specific little adjustments sometimes make a profound difference.  i've liked him since day one, but the turning point came a few weeks ago when he moved my shoulder within its angry little rotator cuff and said "give that a minute."  ...and a moment later, i felt like a little marble was rolling up a groove in the back of my shoulder.  he said "feels like a little crab crawling up your shoulder, right?  it's resetting itself."  ...and now it's love.  don't get me wrong - things like this happen every time i'm in his office.  this was just a particularly good example of knowledge AND knowledge transfer.  my boyfriend and i see him regularly, and always leave talking about how cool it is that he explains the ins and outs of how things connect, how pushing here can change something there.  there's a reason that all of his reviews (here and on google maps) are five stars.

Why did this experience suck?  Hmm... should I begin alphabetically, chronologically, or just as they come to me?  Chronologically you say?  Very well then.  1) She cut my nails WAY shorter than I asked.  2) In the process of repairing one fingernail, she glued the nail to the finger and got glue on my hand.  She didnt even seem inclined to remove the glue - I had to ask.  I also had to ask her to clean under my nails - she had polish in hand before I stopped her and made her go back.  3) Ow, ow, ow, OW, OW!!!  This tiny asian woman manhandled my hands and filed my fingers as if she were getting even with me for something.  And this wasn't a shiatsu "Ow, that hurts but at least now I can move my right arm much better, thanks" kinda pain.  I couldn't believe how surprised she looked when I asked her to ease up.  4) I screwed up my courage and had her make a second filing pass, because despite my considerable reservations, I prefer not to snag the edges on everything I touch.  They're better now - but still a bit jagged.  5) This one drives me batshit.  There's cottonball fuzz STUCK in my manicure.  I had her remove some of it, but didnt notice another until after I left.    6) The nail that was repaired was NOT filed flat - there's a big ugly bump in the middle of the nail - on the opposite side of the little crack I was trying to fix.  7) Both my thumbs bubbled.  I pointed it out.  She fixed one and put another thick coat of polish on the other.  But wait!  I didnt even get to the pedicure yet!  8) OK.  I admit that it had been a while since my last pedicure.  But I'm literally the only person in the place.  Would it be so much to ask that you not skip the oil and lotion part just because you were tired of complaining the ENTIRE WAY THROUGH the cuticle clipping part?  9) When I turned back from watching jeopardy, she'd added unsolicited nail art to both my big toenails while I wasn't paying attention.  And when I say nail art, I mean 3 squiggly green lines across my bright red toes and chunky wet & wild looking silver glitter.  I said "what's that?" and she said "for holiday!"  Even if it hadn't been tacky as fuck, I count 65 days til Christmas.  "Can you just do them red please?  Thanks."   This marks the first time in my life that I havent tipped for a manicure.  Frankly, they're lucky I paid at all.

dr. oyan was just fantastic with my high anxiety kitty - aptly named houdini for her self-preservational talents as an escape artist.  previous vets have been.... patient (at best) about how i have to fetch her out from underneath furniture and disengage each of her claws from my body in order to get her on their table, and how i sometimes fail to keep her there (escape artist - remember?).  this one got down on the floor with us and fed her treats while she trembled under the chair.  this cat suffers more terror than any i've ever seen at the prospect of being in new places - and even more terror at the thought of being touched by strangers.  i was stunned to see her tentatively allowing dr. oyan to handle her.  i've never seen anyone be so understanding and patient with my terrified baby.  another thing i appreciate - dr. oyan was really communicative with me... pointing out all the interesting things in her xrays and showing me how to check for swollen glands.  her prices were reasonable, and she made recommendations but never tried to pressure me about anything.  frankly, i don't think anything will ever keep my psychokitty calm when she has to leave the comfort of her home and routine... but this was far and away her best veterinary experience ever.

those of you who winced (or cackled) through one of my previous reviews of a nightmare on brazilian wax will be relieved to know that i've long since recovered and found a new home at scissors rox paper.  and now to begin the awkward task of publicly praising someone for one of the weirdest things one can ever publicly praise.    nothing makes it easy.  amanda makes it easier.  my appointments with her are quick, friendly, professional, thorough, clean, surprisingly inexpensive... and while "painless" is a myth i've come to rank among greek gods and the great pumpkin... it's really far less painful with her than i've had in YEARS.    best part?  i've been back several times now - and never a stray tuft.  never an ingrown.  never a burn.  never an irritation of any kind.  all in all - never a moment where i wanted to bolt for the door and write a yelp review that would make you really glad you're not me.  trust me - i drive a LONG way to go to amanda because she's worth every cent of the $3.29 per gallon that i'm spending to get there.

Extremely cramped -and I mean wall space as well as floor space.  It's hilariously decorated inside - like the year 1972 just mushroom-clouded all over someone's walk-in closet.  But no complaints.  When you can get a pretty good burger (petite as it may be) and an off-brand fruity soda for $5, how can anyone?

Sexy, sexy, bo-bexy.    This place is gorgeous inside.  Drenched in red light spilling from ornate lamps dangling on chains from the lofted celing and dark enough to make me pretty.  *blink, blink*  The loft sounds just wonderful, but i dont actually know what it's like because they've NEVER LET ME SIT UP THERE even though i've never seen anyone else up there either.  As for service... I've gotta agree that it's not particularly friendly - though I wondered if it was part of the authentic experience to simply treat me like the lesser half of my male companion.  I'm half middle eastern.  If you can't tell by my nose (and to be fair - many can't), you can definitely tell by the last name on my credit card.  so when I politely ask about your americanized name, confirm its middle eastern origins, and hazard a guess as to the meaning (which i looked up later on and i was right, dammit)... there's really no reason to scowl at me and treat me like i've spoken to you without permission.    The drinks are so/so but I always like the hookahs there a lot.  Good flavor may be worth the price... particularly the last time, when I got a surprising buzz after about 15 minutes.

While I mourn the passing of Fate, which for 7 years was my answer to "where to take the out-of-towners to prove that Phoenix can hang with urban hipsters", I'm somewhat consoled by Johnny Chu's new adventure at Sens.    In addition to tapas that rocks the presentation in an atmosphere that is pretty hip without being another intimidation-machine - the food is just fantastic.  My boyfriend and I opted for the fixed price menu on New Years and after the first 2 courses, my toes began to curl when I saw someone headed our way with a plate.  Johnny does things with halibut that are the culinary equivalent of porn.  *homer drool*

ok - i'm just gonna say it: just because it's pasta doesn't mean it has to cater to a ramen noodle budget.  i'm willing to pay a little more when i genuinely enjoy what i'm eating.  these guys have really thought about what's going into your food.  if it isn't grown (or butchered) within az, it's most likely been imported from italy.  and if you're paying attention you can taste the difference - i even got excited about the olive oil.  it looks like a trendy fusion spot, but tastes more like a quiet little place where grandma's rolling out linguine in the kitchen.  now - i admit that i've had exactly one meal there, which doesn't make a sound basis for judgment.  but the dish that i had (orecchiette alla puttanesca) was a wonderful medley of veggies and herbs.  i was particularly in love with the caper berries, which taste like capers but have an entirely different consistency and burst with soft, tasty little seeds when you bite down on them (like a caper mated with a cherry tomato).  it goes wonderfully with a side of pork shoulder, which required no knife and had us fighting over the last bite.  i liked the limoncello cheesecake without absolutely loving it, but it was good enough that i'd try something else from their dessert menu next time.  if future visits convince me that this quality is consistent, a fifth star will be forthcoming.

I hobbled out stung, tufted, and counting the seconds until i could rest a nice cold big gulp between my legs.  They were promoting free wax procedures at their grand opening - and mea culpa for thinking "Ooh! a free Brazilian!"  Did I ever get what I paid for.    The place is pretty and has an open, clean design.  But as a previous reviewer mentioned, the vibe is somewhat ruined by the girls at the front desk.  I felt like I'd finally completed my college experience (15 years later) by spreading my legs in a catty sorority house.  I called ahead to say that while I'd done this before, I was still a bit nervous about it - mostly due to me being a heavier girl - so I specifically requested that I get someone who would know their way around a body that wasn't 21 and svelte.  When I arrived, they handed me off to whoever was standing there at the time (i.e.,"I'm done.  I can take the next person" "Oh, ok, here she is!").  But she was friendly and nice and very reassuring, so I felt pretty good as we walked back.  Once I was inside and in repose, my waxer admitted that she'd only been doing this a few months - and I'd lay odds that she'd never worked on anyone with my body type before, considering that she was reticent to touch me at all.  She also insisted that the entire procedure be done while I was on my back. Those of you who've had a Brazilian before probably know that the all fours position is pretty standard for reaching certain areas.    Now don't get the wrong idea - I wasn't insulted or anything... I wouldn't necessarily adore the thought of pushing someone's hoo-ha around to get all the little hairs off either, but then again... that's not something that comes up much in my chosen career.  My point here is that she missed a lot.  Furthermore - while my previous experiences have hurt too, it's always been brief pain - usually gone before the door shuts behind me.  In this case, I was walking like the mummy for the rest of day.  One more thing - imagine being spreadeagled in front of a total stranger with hot wax very close to your happy spots... and someone knocks on the door behind your head, opens it, has a full conversation with your waxer, and then COMES OVER TO SEE HOW SHE'S DOING.    At that point, I understood that the point of the whole 'free' thing was for the noobs to get some live training - but it wasn't advertised as "our students are as good as professionals - get them before they're charging an arm and a leg!"  For that, you can go to an aesthetician academy.  I even asked why they were doing the promo and they told me on the phone that they were just so confident about their work that they knew everyone would want to be a repeat customer.  I cross myself when I have to walk by them to get to Robek's.  *shudder*  Moral of story: Some things are just not meant to be bought from the bargain bin.  This experience made me want to go crying back to Salon Surreal and bring flowers to Shalah.  Except that like... that'd feel too much like a date, I guess.

It is WRONG to love a burger this much, but the "realness" even impressed my hard-to-impress boyfriend.    I get the all american burger with cheddar instead of american, smash fries, and if I'm up for a caloric splurge - a chocolate shake.  You can tell that the smash fries were potatoes very recently, and they're coated in rosemary and sea salt rather than msg.  The burger is 3-napkin juicy and it's a REALLY good burger - not a cookie cutter disc with traces of freezer burn still clinging to it.  The egg buns are nicely squishy in the middle but still slightly crusty on the outside, and the veggies actually crunch when you bite into them.    And the Haagen Dazs milkshakes?  Yeah - those are real too.  Clearly blended from real ice cream, and a consistency reminiscent of those childhood specialties that bloomed from mom's blender when something awesome like The Wizard of Oz brought everyone together in front of the tv.    It's kind of a weird, chrome-sterile environment to be eating such a down home meal in... but I recommend eating at the tables along the sidewalk outside - gives it a picnic-like quality.
