The food here was decent enough to stick around for, although what really disappointed me and my guests was the service. Our server seemed to really want to be somewhere else the entire time. She was not friendly, she didn't write our orders down, therefore a few things were missed, and most of all she never smiled! Also, didn't recommend anything on the menu, just told us what not to get, weird. Next time, I'll buy a 12 pack and host my own gathering.

Amazing time at CDO tonight. They were super busy but managed to get us a table within 20 mins. Matt always goes above and beyond as a manager to make everyone feel warm and welcome. Great hospitality, food, and management is outstanding every time!

Hidden gem in the heart of Phoenix. Great ambiance and menu. Service was the best part of my experience with Ericka taking such great care of me. She was welcoming, outgoing, well versed with the menu and absolutely charming. I will be back and look forward to bringing my friends next time :)

I wouldn't have such a hard time waiting if the staff was actually hospitable. It felt like an inconvenience asking anyone for anything, and the trend seems to be that people walk away when you need something. Food is good, atmosphere as well, but I would not come back for the service.

Our server Cheryl was so attentive and sweet. I live around the corner and this was my first time in. I loved everything about my experience here. Had the Red Goat Pizza, WOW!!! And the patio was just lovely. Looking forward to coming back and defiantly requesting Cheryl for superb service.

Great time at The Angry Crab tonight. Our server Natalie was absolutely amazing! She was friendly, knowledgeable, accommodating, and made a lasting impression on our group. There were about 15 of us and she spent time explaining and making a memorable experience for all of us. Thanks for the great dining experience tonight :)

Everything we tried at Noble Eatery exceeded our expectations. The food is fresh, unique and made with love. Took home a few loaves of bread, which I cannot get enough of! Awesome job, Noble Eatery, can't wait to come back and enjoy more delightful food.

We tried The Yacht Club for the first time tonight and it was awesome! The ambiance is comfortable and well balanced, the food was utterly perfect and our server was superb. Christin was attentive, helpful, and kind. The lobster rolls are a must try, as are the fish tacos. Overall, very impressed with this concept and what it has to offer.

Wow! What an amazing first time. We were immediately impressed with the ambiance and location as we arrived. Jax made excellent cocktail recommendations and Frances was charming, and well versed with the entire menu. Every single thing we ordered exceeded our expectations. The customer service was top notch, thank you Jax and Frances for the wonderful evening. Can't wait to bring more friends in.
