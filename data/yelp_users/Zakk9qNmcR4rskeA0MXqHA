The food here is phenomenal, and the people are friendly and cool. My favorite is the chicken shawarma plate...the rice is so flavorful (and I don't even eat rice!) and they have this garlic sauce...to die for!!! It takes a few minutes to get your food to go because it does have a restaurant side, and they make it fresh as you order it, but it's totally worth it! Love this place!

Food is decent, but EVERY time I've ordered from them, they get something from my order wrong. This time, I ordered my food at 9:30pm...and they just rang my doorbell 5 minutes before 11pm after telling me 30-45 mins! Really?! Their service sucks!!  Ok, they comped the meal, so that was nice!

Their meat is so flavorful, I love this place! I get the carne asada and chicken nachos, or the filet taco salad...fantastic!!!
