Nice to see real Mexican food remains in the valley.  This food is excellent just like the food I grew up on over 30 years ago. Reasonably-priced, friendly and quick service, great margaritas--I'll be back.

Gotta once a week for lunch.  Chile rellenos and tamales are to die for.  Throw some of those freshly made warm tortillas and I'm in Mexican food heaven.   Bakery is excellent.  Still trying all the different treats. Half I don't know what they are but they are good.    The staff is super nice and helpful. Always clean.  Kind of has the feeling of being at a bazaar.  Love it!!!   Glad it's on my way home from work.

I've tried all the tanning saloons in Phoenix and Tempe.  Camelback Tanning is by far the best--the staff, the pricing and the equipment are above par.  I will drive out of my way to patronize this business.  Steven, the owner, is genuine, cares about all of his customers.

Best, most honest vehicular and dui defense lawyer in the state.  You can't go wrong if you hire him.  He actually gives a shit about his clients.

This place is medical malpractice waiting to happen.  I tried to use them as my primary care physician for the last year.  I could never get my test results, was prescribed inadequate, inaccurate or the wrong meds.   Trying to call to rectify mistakes gets you hold for at least 10 minutes if not transferred to a non-existent voicemail box.    Too many patients, too few trained medical professionals, too much training of med students and too much documenting stuff on the computer--all at the expense of the patient.  They simply do not listen to the patient, don't have enough time and are continually triaging medical dramas.    After giving them two chances to make right following mega screw ups, I am done.  You'd be better treated by any urgent care facility or your local ER.

Just ordered pizza and pasta online.  Easy to order, food was delivered in a timely fashion. Pasta was excellent.  Glad there are more options in this neighborhood beyond the usual corporate pizza mongers.  I shall return.

This was my number 1 agency of choice in terms of donating $ and I've given a lot to them over the years.  I found myself in the unenviable position of needing their help a couple of months ago.  I called and called and called, left a voicemail, no call back and then finally got a human to talk to.   This woman lacked compassion, very bluntly told me I needed to wait 30 days before I could do anything with the animals and it was going to cost me, if they took them, $60 per animal.  No negotiation, no other options and she was doing me a huge favor by answering the phone.    Luckily I had been involved in rescue so I knew some good people that helped with my situation.   But what about the people that don't?   The lady with the rabbit who can barely feed herself?   The family who is being evicted now and can't wait 30 days.  I get why desperate people simply leave their animals at the front of the county pound.   When you are down and out the last thing you can do is pay to turn over your pet.  You get punished for trying to be responsible with your animals.   Enough said. My money will now go to local rescue.  No more humane society.  They are not what they advertise to be.

Going to lunch here for the last 20 years. Nice quality, family owned eatery. I've enjoyed the pasta, salads, sandwiches and pizza for years.  Always a great place to pick up a quick lunch.  Can't go wrong with the variety of daily offerings of pasta and specials like chicken marasala.     High-quality ingredients are used and the portions are generous but not overwhelmingly large.    Recently I discovered their breakfast burritos  and cinnamon rolls.  Yum!!!   Coffee isn't bad either.  So I'm now here for breakfast as well.    Did I say I really like the people that own this place?   They work hard and it shows.

I really wanted to like it here until today. The grounds are nice, rent is reasonable and for the most part it's quiet.    So when I moved in and my dryer and fridge were broken and all my food spoiled I overlooked it since both were replaced by the courteous and attentive maintenance staff within 24 hours.   When I repeatedly can't park in my assigned space because of an illegal parker, and there is really no way to enforce the so-called reserved spaces here I try to overlook it. Parking is a problem here. Not enough spaces. The dirt bags know they can pretty much park anywhere even in someone else's reserved space without consequence.   But what happened this morning and management's reaction or lack thereof I cannot overlook.   I go to the on-site gym very early.  This morning I was followed by four guys who jumped the pool fence and proceeded to knock on the locked gym door while I was in the gym alone.  They wouldn't leave. After 15 minutes I used my cell to call the on-site security who promised they were on there way. After another 15 minutes and the guys still at the gym door leering at me I called the cops.  After another 30 minutes the guys finally left. I never saw security or the cops as I ran back to my apartment.  I don't know the guys or what they wanted but I was very frightened and felt like a hostage inside the gym as they all lurked at the door.  I figured they didn't live in the complex as they were jumping the pool fence in lieu of using the key.   Later this afternoon I personally went to the office to speak with a manager about what occurred this am.  When I told her I had to call the police this morning for an incident at the gym she responded that she was too busy and she would call me.    Guess what?  It's the end of the business day, the office is closed and I never heard from her.  I am an attorney. If I managed a property and a resident was trying to tell me about an incident whereby they had to call the police, I'd take notice.  I'd want to know about it right away to take steps to rectify the situation and possibly limit my employer from liability.    I guess that's not the way management rolls at this place.  Maybe it's because police presence is routine in this complex or because they just don't care about the residents or their safety.    I really really don't want to believe the latter but actions or in this case inaction speaks louder than, well you know.    Thinking of renting here, proceed with caution.     An update to this review, I did receive a call from the manager and the corporate office this am.  My concerns were heard and I was urged to fill out an incident report.  I feel that something will be done to improve security.  I understand this is not the most desirable neighborhood in Phoenix; however I am hopeful the complex will take measures to improve as a result of this incident.

Over 10 years I've patronized Spoonz or its predecessor Silver Spoon Cafe.  Gary and Denise do a nice job of delivering great food at a reasonable price.    The iced coffee is the best around.  A much better alternative for morning coffee and a bagel, or scone or pastry than Starbucks.  The staff is very knowledgeable in making coffee drinks.  The coffee is the highest quality.   Much care is taken in hiring and training the very friendly and responsive staff.  You can't go wrong here.  Gary and Denise have put their all into this business and it shows.  Oh and their cupcakes and seasonal treats are da bomb.  Best way to cheer myself up when I'm having a bad day or for gifting to coworkers and friends. It's apparent that the bakery case is filled with homemade treats.

Bad bad service.  Seems to be the trend at downtown eateries:  if you are a professionally dressed male the female waitstaff will cater to you. If not, you are on your own and may wait a good while for service.   Such is the case today. My female friend and I ( both professionally dressed as we are lawyers) met for lunch. Tables were full so we sat at the counter for about ten minutes without anyone acknowledging us or clearing the previous occupant's dirty dishes away.    The waitress was busy flirting with a couple of male customers. Although she saw us, she ignored us so we moved to another portion of the counter closer to where she was flirting.  We finally got some service after about another five minutes.   Food was ok.  And this isn't the first time I've been ignored at the counter in lieu of a male customer.  Silly me for going back. No mas.

Best carwash in Phoenix metro.  My car was filthy and I had limited time.  Detail-oriented, professional and prompt.  Car clean on the outside and inside in about 25 minutes as promised.  Time and money well spent.  I shall return although it's a bit out of my way.  Pleasant waiting area with a coffee bar.

Frightening.  During the pedicure the guy used the water in which my feet had been soaking to massage my calves. I am so grossed out.  They were almost hostile.  I wanted a gel manicure and normal pedicure.  They tried to give me a gel pedicure.    Absolute nightmare. I walked out after the pedicure. No going back.

Money, money, money.  They want their copays, deductibles ASAP and if insurance doesn't cover it all be prepared to pay.  They will not work with you and their payment plans are unreasonable.   Me and my cancer will have to go someplace cheaper. Docs seem to be good and staff, but too expensive for me

I love this place.  Location, hours and pricing are all convenient and reasonable.  The lady who is always there is very friendly and courteous.  After over a year of patronizing this place I will not go anyplace else.  Never a bad experience.

Ron Rocks!!!   He detailed my car in my parking garage at home, bumper to bumper last Thursday.    Ron is professional, knowledgeable and takes pride in his work--all hard to find nowadays.    My car looks like it just came off the showroom floor which was 11 years and 77k miles ago.  There is just no other place to go for wash, wax, clean and shine.  And the price is right for what he delivers.

These guys rock.  They re-keyed 6 doors, my entire house, expertly, efficiently and for a reasonable price. Even guaranteed their work. When there was a little glitch with one of the locks they returned for a quick fix free of charge.  Must excellent!   Thank you Johnny Locksmith.  I'll keep your # on speed dial.

No more. Been coming here for breakfast on weekday mornings.  The food is excellent. Female barristas at the wine counters where I usually sit not so much.    They tend to pay more attention to the male customers from the courthouse--male lawyers.  Sometimes it takes awhile for them to "notice" I'm there when engrossed in conversation with their male clientele.  I've actually left without ordering on a previous occasion.   But I'm a sucker for their excellent food.  Went back just now, was able to order, but once I received my food no one checked back with me to see if the food was ok, refill my coffee or anything.  Luckily someone had slapped the bill down otherwise I'm convinced is still be waiting to pay.    I'm thinking service is better if you are male and look like you are part of the legal profession.    No more for me.  There are other places I can try downtown and my prior calls to Management have gone unheeded.

For as many Thai restaurants in downtown Phoenix you'd think they'd be nicer to their customers.  But no!!!!!   Rude, rude, rude.  Repeatedly treated like I'm bothering them and they are too busy.  And don't even try to phone in an order--they will make you hold forever.   Even if the food were better I'm done doing business with them as a regular downtown luncher.  If I want Thai, I'll try their competition.
