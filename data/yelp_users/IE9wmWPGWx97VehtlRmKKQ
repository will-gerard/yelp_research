Long after man has left this planet, remnants of its glory shall remain. Much like the end scene of Planet of the Apes, man's masterpieces cannot be fully erased.  Full disclosure: Gameworks was never amazing, nor was it a consummate achievement of mankind, but my god in heaven, has it fallen far from being an enjoyable diversion.  Visiting Gameworks the other night after a movie, I did not even recognize the inside. In the past year, Gameworks has transitioned from a two-story video game mecca to a trashy, shotgun-style Dave and Buster's knock-off with a few old racing and carnage games sprinkled along the wings. What was once full of racing simulation games, a multi-story pirate-cum-balloon fight (or for the old folks, it used to be a shooting tower), and new-age arcade games, has become a vacuous shell with half-corroded consoles and token-munching, brainless ticket dispensers.   Much of the interior has been gutted, leaving odd walking patterns and vast arrays of blank canvas. 10-15% of the arcade games were "under repair" and another 5-10% were in great need of service (Virtua Tennis now has the cinematography of a Lumiere Bros. film). The remaining games feature nothing you could not find in the lobby of a movie theatre. Instead, Gameworks' focus is on ticket-oriented games such as Deal or No Deal and some game where you jump in the air and get tickets depending on when you land in relation to an arbitrary, electronic lighting wheel.  If that level of lowest common denominator banality thrills you, change this rating to 5 stars.  If I'm scraping the bottle of the barrel for positivity, I can compliment their beer selection (San Tan and 4 Peaks) and pricing (5 bones a pint); however, that does not justify the large-scale Peter Piper Pizza whitewashing of Gameworks' product line.  I'm giving it a courtesy star for the fond memories, but, like Lady Liberty on the beachhead, Gameworks is completely broken.

Where can I start with this majestic palace of deliciousness?  Do I start with the cradle-to-grave phenomenal service that I received? Each employee assisting with our meal was gracious, friendly, passionate about their food, and helpful, with a customer-minded approach. The recommendations and guidance were all spot-on and without a spot of condescension or assumption as to palate.  Do I start with the delightful Lebanese beers served cold and modestly priced? Or would it be wiser to start with the hummus plate, seeping out of its serving dish with tender meat, succulent tomatoes, warm, crisp pita, and crunchy pine nuts? Each bite matched the oily, savory flavors of tahini and rich spices with a cool splash of spicy pilsner.   Or do I start by echoing the well-deserved praise of the tomato soup? Like something out of a volcano, the tomato soup etched a crimson, bubbling line along my taste buds, dazzling me with creaminess and soothing me with earnest tomato flavors.  I'd probably have to start there, because it would be wrong to start with the lamb special of the evening: ouzi. Baked after a long bath in deeply soothing marinades, the lamb was moist and full of layered flavors. Dipped into mint chutney, the flavors evolved further, forcing me to helplessly devour every last piece, while catching hints of cinnamon and pepper.   Sidebar: my special lady friend had chicken taouk and it was fantastic as well, with a crunchy black grill mark that sealed in a citrus and garlic burst.  At that point, I was prepared to shower Byblos with hyperbole and senseless praise, damning myself to an eternity as the ferryman of new souls to Byblos, a sort of Charon to their restaurant. But then I ate their Tiramisu and it was the best Tiramisu I had ever had up to that point in my life.  I'm writing this review from inside one Byblos' meat coolers. I haven't left in two days. I've been living in the kitchen, eating their food without rest. And yet, even now, as I pause to digest, I'm not sure where to start next.

Ted's is where you go for hot dogs in the valley.  That would be a perfectly acceptable review of Ted's Fine Perfectly Charred Spectacularly Plump And Juicy Hot Dogs and (unfortunately) indicative of their shortcomings as well.  Ted's certainly has the best dogs in the area. The All Beef and Polish are out of this world, with the Foot Long and White Hots being entirely acceptable as well. The dogs are charred with precision and crackle in your mouth the way few can. If I spent hours trying to reveal a shortcoming in the dogs at Ted's, I would come up empty; they are defiantly tasty.  So it's an absolute shame that nothing else on the menu is remarkable. The onion rings, fries, and chili are all passable items with nothing terrible to note. All are slightly between the descriptors 'bland' and 'your married friend's backyard party that wasn't awful but wasn't good either.' Even the lauded Loganberry shake tastes of awkwardly assembled syrup and soft-serve with no real heart to it. All of the sides pale even further when you return your attention to the marvelous hot dog in your hand.  So just get two hot dogs and Ted's might just be perfect.

Geisha A Go Go, though flawed in several aspects, succeeds on the basis of having an unbelievable happy hour in a location that would typically demand otherwise.  Their happy hour runs from 3-7 M-F and features half off sake bombers, house maki, appetizers, and spirits. The pricing is relatively modest for old town, so the savings is noticeable and deeply appreciated.   As for the overall quality of accommodations and dining, the staff is friendly and attentive even during the convergence of happy hour, while the decor is a chic blend of retro Japanese kitsch and jade-infused natural motifs. The food is good, if not decidedly simplistic. The rolls are well-packed and the menu features an expansive selection of seafood blends; however, none of it tastes truly exciting. The standouts include any of the broiled rolls that include spicy mayo as a warm, bubbling topping, as well as the Flying Kamikaze (a blend of unagi and smoked salmon with sweet chile sauce). Geisha's menu does reach for eccentricity (they have a roll with Fritos on it in case you are pregnant or high), but most rolls wash out the unique flavors and land as bland on the palate. The only item of truly low quality is the gyoza, as it is consistently undercooked.  I wouldn't recommend Geisha outside of happy hour, as it isn't good enough to justify full pricing; however, it is so cheap during happy hour, that the shortcomings vanish with the dollar signs.

What a place!!  They have absolutely splendid food and drink. We started off with the primers, which are glorious, tender prime rib sliders. They taste like God and meat. I highly recommend them.  After that, we rolled with some meatloaf, which was the Thursday special. It tasted like grandma made it while she was running a dive bar. It was hearty, thick, and tangy in the best ways.  No dessert for us, but we drank old fashioneds and pitchers, both of which were well priced. Don't forget to like them on Facebook for cheap drinks.

We all need to be honest with ourselves: Canteen is just not very good. We have been lying to ourselves about its quality for far too long and we all need an intervention or something.   We all want Canteen to be good, because it has helped usher in a slightly more upscale version of Mill with fare that is not your usual college bar. We can agree to give it points for that, but little else. Nothing about Canteen justifies its absurdly-priced margaritas, as 9 bucks for tequila-tinged kool-aid is a farce. We all have had better margaritas and we all know that Canteen's margs spend all day marinating in a pre-mixed jug. The beer selection is hardly impressive (even for Mill) and the staff is a synapse or two above catatonic.  We don't really like Canteen's happy hour anyways, because Z Tejas' is better. We've all had better tacos just about anywhere, because we live in Arizona, a place where tacos rain down on us like a rap video. We don't like Canteen's dance floor or its patio, because both are poorly designed, overcrowded, and noisy to the point of making Nine Inch Nails seem timid. We want to like Canteen, because its better than Zuma, but everything is better than Zuma. I once drank a forty at a bus stop and it was better than Zuma. We have to be willing to accept Canteen as a gateway to a better Mill Ave, but not a truly good bar.  I know we can do this together, Tempe. We have to stop pretending that Canteen is a quality establishment and we have to do the right thing: drink tequila at real tequila bars.

Kelly's is one of the few bars in old town that justifies repeat visits, as it successfully handles being a modest, welcoming establishment in an area that panders to elitism and usually ignores the point of going out: actually being fun.  Kelly's is remarkable for its savvy architecture, spanning multiple rooms that are easily accessed, but strategically intimate. Before the bar gets packed (around 10 p.m.), you can find sofas, televisions, pool, darts, etc. broken off into individual areas that seclude without excluding other patrons. The bar games are free and of high quality (the dartboards are most impressive), while the lounge seating is trendy and comfortable. These qualities allow Kelly's patrons to actually enjoy themselves while imbibing or eating. Plus, the decor has an excellent sense of the macabre and unique, blending African artwork, breweriana, and abstract shapes into a melting pot of modern taste.  I didn't eat there; however, the drinks were a cut above other old town cocktails, as they were stiff and made with excellent spirits. The Manhattan I had struck all the right chords and the Arizona Mule was an exciting, bitter take on the Moscow Mule, without losing the spiciness of the ginger. The bar staff was courteous and attentive, with a good sense of humor and consistent mixing skills. Nothing was watered down or aggressively one-note.  The drinks are, regrettably, a few dollars overpriced, but I don't understand the frustrations with the pricing that have been voiced in other reviews, as that is par for the course in old town. I didn't feel ripped off, as the ambiance and drink quality make up for the steep bill (unlike most old town bars where the pricing has no correlation to a sense of quality), but I definitely noticed how much the drinks cost. Similarly, the clientele is not going to be fundamentally different than other old town bars. You came to an old town bar -- you should know what you're getting yourself into.   Kelly's succeeds far more than it fails, fusing modesty with quality; just be prepared to pay a little bit more for it.
