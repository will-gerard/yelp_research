Mexican food is funny because it's one cuisine that we tend to have so many favorites in that we need to make sub-categories. As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp.   If I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy.   Service is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish.

I love Baby Kay's like pirates love stealing. It's good enough to wipe clean the memory of taking a horrible girlfriend there for our first date. The craw fish ettouffe is something I have to stop to contemplate each bite of because I struggle to comprehend why it's so delicious. The gumbo and jambalaya are also stellar. I like to merge all three in the Cajun Combination.   They make a raspberry vinaigrette there that deserves it's own paragraph and is mandatory on your dinner salad.   Another fantastic creation here is the apricot habenero glaze that one would think would over-power a chicken salad, not the case. Now I know most of you see the h-word and imagine terrible pain, this dish is not prohibitively hot, it manages to catch the flavor of the much maligned pepper and only a fraction of its fire.    If you happen upon Baby Kay's  on a day when the special is seafood enchiladas, get them and call me for a refund if you anything less than amazed.    Staff is pretty low key and nice here. Not a good call if you're in a hurry, but worth being late over. I usually sit at the bar if minutes are precious and outside if my time is my own. For what you get the prices are very reasonable.

Carolina's is like that older friend you had in high school who carried a knife; there's an element of danger in the distance, but you always feel taken care of.    I love that if the parking lot is full of fire trucks from Avondale, I can park at Homero's Christian Auto Care for $.50.    I also like the cost of tortillas which are good enough to grab two dozen of and run to your car and devour them until you feel the need to put the seat back into the food coma position.  When I worked close by, I would stop in sometimes for the Oaxaca for breakfast...hangover be GONE!  Lunches usually steered me toward the green chili beef enchiladas. I once found a small rock in them and was not even swayed. Sometimes you just have to eat a rock, though I spit this one out.   Now I don't mind that this place is run down and not how I imagine my dream home, my only real issue with Carolina's is the fact that they seem to use the cheapest, flimsiest plastic ware on the market. Otherwise, this place is all splendor.

Carl Wellman runs this one-chair barber shop in downtown Mesa and has cut my hair for about 15 years now. He's a sweetheart of a man and turns out 10 minute haircuts with military precision. I live in downtown Phoenix and Carl always makes me happy to make the trek to my old juvenile stomping grounds.

The food here is wonderful. I always have a difficult time deciding on the jalapeno pecan pancakes or the green flannel hash, but the outcome is always very good.   Now slow service doesn't really bother me. I think quality food takes time and I appreciate that process. However, I think the problem isn't that service is slow more so, it's inattentive. I tend to get the same waiter most of the time there and he delivered once out of 7 or 8 times. The issue with this guy is that he spends his time flirting with the female customers and it's embarrassing when you're coffee cup and water glass are empty and you've been waiting for your bill for a half hour while two girls who don't seem interested endure his anecdotes. When that guy gets a girlfriend I may give this place 5 stars.

Despite the fact that I could walk into just about any place in town for a pancake related meal and belly right up to an open table, I prefer the wait-required, OPH.   My favorite is the apple pancake which is baked with caramel and sliced granny smith apples. When it comes to your table pipping hot, it has risen from baking and as you watch it deflate and cool the mouthwatering makes you check your pant leg to ensure you still have a napkin. Make sure you can wait the 40 or so minutes it takes for this one.   While the Jr version of this pancake is still a bountiful portion, I love adding a side of home style fries. They cut the potatoes to about a half inch or so and add onions and bell peppers, so tasty.   As a creature of habit I can at times manage to sway myself to order something else on the menu. The banana pancakes actually have mashed  bananas worked into the pancake batter and it's really spectacular. The Lingonberry crepes sometimes come in handy when I can't scrape up enough cash to go to Holland. The omelets are also baked and worth the time it takes to get to you.   I've been going to this place for almost 20 years now and I have never had bad service or a dish that wasn't wonderful.

I visited this dentist four years ago and I thought his staff and assistants were bitchy. I went for a cleaning, nothing more. I paid whatever my co-pay was that my insurance didn't cover and thought that was that.   Six months later I get a bill for $75. Thinking there must be some issue, I call and dispute the charge. I was told there were some services my insurance didn't cover...for a cleaning. I told them that I only had a cleaning and based on the info I had from my provider, I paid what I owed. I never heard back on the matter.   Now, four years later I am living in LA and get a bill $296 for a previous balance from two months ago. I called to dispute the bill and now they are threatening to send the matter to collections. What a scam. I wonder if I'm the only person this is happening to.

Lux is my favorite, everything here is fantastic. All the barista's know your drink and have a welcome smile to see you. Pastries are made on site, ample in selection and are delicious. If you think you're too chubby for cake there's usually fresh fruit hanging around and yogurt in the mornings. Free wi-fi and free people watching are a bonus to this dimly lit and cozy atmosphere.

Richardson's is often described as fanastic, but a little pricey. Now I'm not the wealthiest man, but I have to disagree. For the quality of ingredients and the portions that are generous to even a fat man, you can't call Richardson's plates expensive. Not to mention, I usually get something off the Santa Fe Trail side of the menu which is usually $10-$15. Then there's the brunch menu, carrying my favorite enchiladas and eggs. For ten bucks I get a hot manhole cover size plate with two shrimp enchiladas, two eggs, beans, potatoes and green sauce, that's a gift for the money.  There is also a special place in my heart for the GCP, a twice baked sweet potato in a hatch green chili, stunning.

O.H.S.O. is one of the many declining restaurants that is propped up by good food and a wide selection of beers and being dragged down by poor service.   I once went there for breakfast and had a waiter that was really spacey and inattentive. He had to be reminded of orders and things he forgot more than once. When I pointed out that fruit on my plate was moldy he took the single moldy piece of fruit off the plate ant set it back on my table reminding me that sometimes these things happen. Really? I've never been served moldy food before. That is disgusting and the completely wrong attitude.   I took that experience as a red flag, but didn't think it was damning. Yet another visit clued me in that my money is better spent elsewhere.  I went one night and sat in the bar one weeknight after the dinning room had closed. Just after I ordered food and drinks and group of people went from the bar to the patio to smoke. The patio opening is as wide as the patio so the smoke naturally blows into the bar. I mention the smoke to the bartender who brought our drinks and before I finished speaking she cut me off and said, "because you're sensitive?" in a completely inappropriate tone. I should have just left then and there. There is no excuse to be that rude to a guest.   Our food comes and it's less than impressive. The fries in my order were recooked. When the waiter cleared our table he dropped the two uneaten cups of mustard that come with the pretzels on the floor. He was upset because he got mustard on his pants. He wasn't that upset that he'd gotten it on the floor which explains why he left it there. When I left the table I slipped and nearly fell from it. What kind of jackass just dumps something you could slip on in front of your table?   I tried calling the restaurant to voice my discontent and no one would ever pick up the phone. I sent a message through a forum on their website. The response I got back was defensive and told me I should have talked to a manager that night. So should I have talked to the rude bartender or the guy to busy to clean up the mustard from the floor?!?! The message might as well have just been a suggestion of other restaurants to visit instead.
