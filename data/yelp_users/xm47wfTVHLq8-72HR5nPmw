The G&D captures most of what an English pub is all about - to a great enough extent that I have actually forgotten I am in Phoenix when in there on occasion.  There are some excellent beers on tap, including Abbott's Ale, IMO the best beer one can obtain in Phoenix.  The English Sunday Lunch is authentic and pretty good. I won't say excellent as I cook better, but for somewhere out it is more than good enough and on a par with pubs back home - and at a VERY reasonable price.  The Cornish pasties and Shepherd's Pie are 'ok', but not as seasoned as I like or cook - but a safer bet to appeal to the masses / American palettes...  Dave the owner is a very nice chap and always friendly and willing to talk to people when he is there as is his brother who is often found serving behind the bar.  All in all a very worthwhile place to snag a bite to eat and a pint - and play pool, darts or watch soccer on TV if they take your fancy.

IMO THE best Chinese in Phoenix! Authentic dishes and Chinese beers, excellent service, great atmosphere, very good prices - thoroughly recommend.  Clearly I am not the only one thinking this as the owner appears to know the names of a LOT of the clientele - demonstrating regular repeat business.

Slightly more expensive than some other supermarket chains, but high quality, excellent selection, so worth it. Love their sushi and locally sourced brats, the veggies are always fresh and an excellent selection. Great selection of cheeses.

Being English I am a BIG fan of Indian food. IMO this is the best Indian restaurant in the N. Phoenix metro (and I have tried several). The staff are friendly and courteous and the food is better than most. Being as I like my food spicy, I like that you can choose the spice level when ordering.

IMO Fuddruckers is THE place to get a burger. I love the fact that you can get buffalo and large size burgers - and that you get to choose and add the toppings yourself. A great place for a tasty lunch or quick dinner out that is real casual and easy.

Absolutely LOVE coming here for salad. The offerings are always  fresh and there is a great selection enabling the creation of a salad to your own personal specifications. When you consider the salad selection, the chili soup and other offerings, plus the choice of sweets; it is very reasonably priced too.

Excellent strong English cheddar "Coastal" Highly recommend it. Great place for bulk buys of items you use a lot provided you are familiar with prices - Johnsonville brats for example are an excellent price in large packs, just seperate and freeze. Awesome home brand (Kirkland) smoked salmon.

Now it probably seems strange to be giving a fast food joint a 4 star review.. and I'll admit they aren't my first choice other than on special occasions... but that being said, this particular Jack in the Box has ALWAYS been spotlessly clean when I've visited it, the various staff members polite, courteous and efficient and the food cooked to fast food perfection - so if you need a drive through / something fast, I highly recommend it.

Frankly, I was not impressed. I was asked "links or patties' I chose links, I got patties.. I asked for eggs 'over easy', they were raw around the yolks even though the outside was cooked, looked like they were steamed or something... Bread / toast was below par and over buttered. Marmalade comes out in some kind of pot - why?  So, short version, I eat out a LOT in these kinds of places - and this is one where I won't be going back. Iowa Cafe just down the road blows it away.

LOVE the coffee, prefer it to C4's, a nice, robust, full flavor. Great food, simple, plain fare, but done well and done fast. There is an option to sit outside in a patio area between buildings, so it is fairly secluded and peaceful. It is also dog friendly (as well as biker friendly), so if you and man's (or woman's) best friend fancy a breakfast break together and perhaps hang out with the newspaper, this would make an excellent venue. Does NOT take debit / credit cards, cash or check only.

I have visited a couple of times now, with various friends and everyone loves the place and the food.  Let's start with the place.... As my wife put it: "It feels like we are in San Diego" (somewhere she loves); the combination of the pond, turtles, ducks, geese, trees and birds convinces one that you are no longer in the middle of the desert, but have been transported to some oasis of green, water and cool..... A wonderful setting for a meal.  You can either sit outside around the pond and enjoy being surrounded by the trees and wildlife, or if you are a little less adventuresome, there are plenty of tables inside, some up against floor length glass at the edge of the pond, so it seems as though you are outside.  The food itself is fresh (the salad is always crisp & tasty), VERY well cooked and the service excellent. We have tried a wide selection of dishes between us and everyone has been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the dishes presented.  If you are unsure what to choose, I recommend going with the 'Daily Special', I have opted for this a couple of times and on both occasions it has been excellent.  It is also very reasonably priced - I thoroughly recommend El Encanto!

Good coffee, good service from friendly staff, pleasant ambience. However, the breakfast burritos are currently under review due to Chef changes. Management assure me things will improve - Time will tell and if they do, I will amend this review to reflect that.  I generally ride up (motorcycle) as it is a good hangout to chat with other bike owners and look at the bike porn early of a weekend morn.

When I worked down in Tempe we often used to come here for lunch. Between the group of us we have sampled numerous selections from the menu and it has all been good to excellent.  The atmosphere is also good and the staff are friendly, making it one of my favorite Tempe lunch spots.

A small friendly, clean diner with a friendly kind of family atmosphere. THE best breakfast sausage IMO, awesome omelets, great home fries; VERY friendly and efficient staff. The place is always fairly busy, and no surprise, the service is great, the food is awesome and the prices are very fair. As well as the breakfast offerings they also do excellent Italian food - perfect for a lunch or to take home for dinner.

My favorite "Mexican" in Phoenix.... If you are planning a lunch trip, be sure to get there early (before 11:30) or you will be in for a wait - but it is well worth it.  I LOVE their salsa & chips, the best anywhere IMO and they also offer a 'hot' version that you can mix in to taste.  I am a fan of 'hot' foods with a bit of pep to them and Aunt Chilada's delivers on specific dishes (ie there is plenty of other offerings if spicy is not your style). The 'Aunt Chilada Special' is my favorite - a cubed, spicy beef filled enchilada covered with both red and green sauces, topped off with cheese and sour cream, served with a choice of sides (I normally go with rice and 'fidao' (sp) - kinda "Mexican spagetti".  I have been eating here for many years as do many people I know, there IS a reason it is always packed - Highly recommended.  There is seating both inside and outside, so depending upon the weather and your personal taste you can do either.

Excellent atmosphere and Irish decoration / furniture inside (and I am English - have been to Ireland many times), it reminds me of the TARDIS as it looks small and nothing special from the outside and seems MUCH bigger once you get inside. Love the overall atmosphere. The service is good, the menu varied and the food excellent.

I have been here several times now and apart from one instance, the fish n chips have always been excellent. The secret is knowing which days the owners (Brits) are working in there, because on those days you are going to get the real deal as thought you were in England.   The bubble & squeak is also authentic and good.  The atmosphere is reminiscent of the UK, with some nice photos of the UK adorning the walls and the smells and sounds of a chippie surrounding you.  On Tuesdays they have 'open mike night' which is fine if you enjoy that kind of thing (pipes, beards and sandals anyone?).  Of course real chip shops do not sell alcohol as they don't have liquor licenses, but the British bar is a welcome addition and it means you can do the pub and chip shop all in one place! :)

Truly authentic English fish and chips - I was back in England two weeks ago, had Fish N Chips three times and The Codfather was better than two of them...  I LOVE the English breakfast they do at the weekend (but don't open until 10:00) as well as the homemade pies, pasties and sausage rolls... they also have an English store section in there for various English goodies and frozen food as well as a great bar section with a wide range of English / European beers both draft and bottled. Well worth a visit!

Being from England, I am used to bread made freshly in the local bakers... Balkan Bakery makes the bread daily on the premises (you can actually see them doing it), and it is AWESOME! They make from several flours, white, whole wheat, rye, seven grain, etc... In various shapes & sizes. They also offer some ethnic food items that are bakery based, some savory and some sweet, including the best tiramisu I have ever had. HIGHLY recommend them, need to get there in the early AM though as they sell out fast.

It took a LONG time to get noticed / get some service. The tables were nice and clean. The 'boneless hot wings' looked more like cat food with mystery sauce on them - EASILY the worst wings I have ever had... At least the Lagunitas was served cold and tasted good. The fries were 'meh, kind of ok' - overall a missed opportunity and a disappointment. Do NOT recommend.

I've been here twice as after the first experience I decided to give them another chance before writing them off.. BOTH times had to wait ages before being shown to a table and the same for service afterwards. Second time sat at the table over ten minutes before a server arrived - never got a coffee refill either, in the end had to hunt her down and ask for one - NOT GOOD. A shame as the food was, but I like to go somewhere where I can order and enjoy my food in a reasonable amount of time and drink coffee with it. Won't be going back.

The US arm of English food giant Tesco.. LOVE the selection of English food that I can't find elsewhere (or at reasonable prices at least) such as Heinz cream of tomato soup, Sharwoods curry related offerings, Baxters French Onion... Also a reasonable selection of other items at fair prices and never too busy or crowded.

This is one of my favorite burger joints. Now to be honest, I don't eat burgers that often as I prefer something 'slightly more adventurous and healthy' as a general rule, but they are on my 'cheat list' - and when I get a craving for a burger, THIS is where I come, great tasting meat, excellent onions, nice bun... the fries are fine too - and the staff are always friendly, courteous and efficient.

Jeff (the manager) is a great guy who really knows his stuff. He is always more than happy to share his knowledge and take the time to ensure you get what you need, even if you didn't really know what that was when you went in. Because the owners and staff are all riders themselves, the Helmet Center stores always have a great selection of gear and clothing, etc that people actually want and use, if you want something bike related and it is any good, you can pretty much bet you will find it at the Helmet Center - and if they don't happen to have what you want in stock , they will order it and get it within a couple of days for you.

Ok, so a little bit of a mixed bag, but leaning much more towards the positive. Very convenient parking and a garden area out back. Very clean, nice decor, great ambience, tastefully decorated. Reminded me of similar places in London. However the bench seats are too low and soft, my companion almost vanished into one. I had a glass of Reisling, and to be honest if I didn't know it I would have said it was a Chardonnay. It lacked the crispness and 'bite' of a good Reisling, but not unpleasant to drink. My companion's mimosa was excellent! The food was really good too, and nicely presented and the service was great. Overall a very pleasing experience and I certainly intend to go back.

Their crab puffs are excellent, as is there chicken fried rice (which they prepare fresh as demonstrated by the fact that you can ask them to leave out the peas for example (a friend of mine does this) and they do it, no problem. Several other dishes are good too, the only thing I was underwhelmed with was the curry - nowhere near enough spice for me, very bland.

Ok so I decided to give this place a shot as it's nearby and I had heard some good things on the local grapevine... Whilst I was waiting to meet my friend, I sat outside and admired a pair of BMW sport motorcycles... Turns out they're the owners - so fellow riders.. good start for those of us who ride! Moving on.. We went in and found it clean and inviting, the menu is up in chalk... I had the 'Sonoran Wrap' and I have to tell you it was absolutely one of, if not, the best wrap / burrito type meal I have ever had! All the veggies were crisp, fresh and flavorful and the eggs were cooked to perfection. I also had coffee, black.. and it was strong without being bitter, VERY good. My friend had the Italian Hero wrap and loved that too. Very friendly people, excellent atmosphere, parking right out front - HIGHLY recommend it!

I first used TEAM Arizona for the basic 'get your license safety course' after moving here from England. I thought that despite having ridden for over twenty years, that it made sense to get some local training as well as getting my motorcycle endorsement before riding here.  Well, was I ever RIGHT! I can't recall the couple of gentlemen's names who took that first course, but it was absolutely awesome! Even an old hand like me learned plenty of new things, I was VERY impressed. The course content was excellent, as were the trainers and the facility / bikes we used.  Since then I have undertaken dirt training with Curt, who is an excellent, down to earth tell it to you straight tutor - do you want someone to blow smoke to make you feel good, or actually IMPROVE YOUR SKILLS? Curt WILL improve your skills if you listen and do as he says... I know he did mine.  The same goes for Tealdo and the rest of the 'street' crew - an awesome bunch who are ALWAYS interesting in helping you to succeed and become a better, safer rider. All these people have a passion and a love of their work and of seeing you do well - and it shows.  I cannot recommend TEAM Arizona highly enough.
