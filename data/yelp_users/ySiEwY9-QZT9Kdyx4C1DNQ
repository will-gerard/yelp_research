Been adjusted over 15 years by numerous Chiropractors and Dr. Scott has some of the best healing hands I've ever experienced. He also adjusts my children and family. We highly recommend the office and all it has to offer. Best massage therapists in town too!

Of all the Italian restaurants in AZ, this one is close to the best!!! I've yet to have a bad experience or meal here. The food is superb and when you ask to change up the dish it's never a problem. Love the minestrone soup!! Highly recommend trying this gem of a place!!

I can't say enough good things about this company!! Timely, professional, and quality work to name a few. Competitive pricing and fast instillation. I would recommend if your looking for new flooring, look no further.

Very unhappy with the service and quality of food. They have changed the ordering process and it is very confusing. Why change something that worked so well? My boyfriend ordered a half a panini for $6 and it was done in 2 bites. Needless to say this location we will not be returning to.

Been going to this salon for years and always had a decent experience. Last Friday I went and had the worst pedicure of my life. The new manger was using a tool for my callous's and cut me in 2 places on my ankle bone. I was bleeding and he then put a blue disinfectant in my open cuts which in turn stung so bad I yelled out loud. The worst part is he never apologized once. Now I'm pretty sure I might need to see a Dr because it's not healing right. Only good thing is when I went to show them yesterday the ladies that work there were very kind and when I asked for a refund they gave it to me without any problem.

Nice atmosphere. Appetizers were good recommend the bruschetta. pastas cooked excellent. Chicken francese  was sent back not as good as expected. Deserts were above average and extremely tasty. Service was great also.
