My left rear tire was low, so after meeting a friend for lunch (at Sakana, which gets my next review of "YUM!"), I went to the gas station to use their air. I've had bad luck with these things, so I was trepedatious. Aaaaaand, for good reason - it did let more air out of my tire.   Luckily, there was a Greulich's Auto Repair next door, so I rolled over and asked if they could put air in my tires. They said, "Sure!"   As the mechanic was filling my left rear tire, he found a nail. No wonder that tire was low! He repaired it on the spot and off I went.  Very helpful, and nice! I live considerably north-er and would go back down to this Greulich's.

There are other places in town that are less expensive with better sushi choices, and not as loud, but I had an experience today that inspired me to write here this evening.   I go to Ra (Scottsdale Rd) somewhat frequently for their lunch special which is a good deal: miso soup, yummy salad with addictive ginger dressing, a california roll and four pieces of nigiri. Good stuff. I usually upgrade to a rainbow roll and just pay the difference.   A few months ago I went to a different sushi place in Tempe. I paid with cash and when my change was returned, the server had "rounded up" and treated himself to a presumptuous tip (he didn't return my coins). I called the manager over, went home and wrote a bad review on Yelp, tell people not to go to that restaurant and won't return to eat there again.  This afternoon I sat at the sushi bar, had excellent service, good happy hour eats, and good discussion with the young sushi chef. I paid with cash and my Ra server gave me back my change ... minus coins. I immediately got tense and thought "great, here we go again." I called her over to explain. She said that she had rounded-up - in my favor. I counted my bills and saw that she had indeed given me back my change plus a little extra. She said that she didn't have coins, so she just gave me the difference.   I thought that was very cool. I thanked her, and left a big tip. Now I'm writing about my good experience at Ra Sushi on Scottsdale Road and will definitely keep going there.   It's amazing how one little gesture will have such ripples.

Read this carefully: They have a POLICY to STEAL your MONEY.  Mangers are telling waitstaff to "round checks up" - so when you get your bill of $8.65 and give them a $20, you will get back $11 and no change.   Sure a disappearing $ .45 doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is when it is your money. Then the waiter tells you that his boss told him, and other waitstaff told him that's "the way it's done."   This happened to me not 20 minutes ago.  Stealing.  Policy.  Illegal.  (never mind the mediocre food....)

This is a new restaurant in Scottsdale, in the Optima Camelview Village on the North West side of Highland Avenue off Scottsdale Road.   Their website does not give an actual address because unfortunately, the building complex's address would lead you a block north of the restaurant. Dining at this restaurant is well worth the address confusion though.   My boyfriend and I went last night (Saturday night) for dinner. There is free parking in the underground garage, and you walk up the drive to street level. Nourish is conveniently located near the entrance of the complex next to the garage. The space has a light, airy feeling with plenty of shaded outdoor seating and breezy indoor seating.   The menu includes seafood, meat dishes, vegan dishes, gluten-free meals, appetizers, desserts and a full bar.   I got a salmon burger on bed of greens with sweet potato fries and my boyfriend got steamed teriyaki brown rice bowl with broccoli, snap peas, carrots, cashews and chicken.   Both meals were amazingly good! My salmon burger had a lemon herbed aioli that blended wonderfully with the flavors. So very good.  After dinner our friendly waitress suggested ice cream for dessert. I can't eat dairy, so I started my usual deflection. She reassured me that it's made with coconut milk, so we ordered it. Chocolate Chai coconut milk ice cream. Oh, yum! Just the right amount for the two of us to share for dessert. Next time I'm trying the apple pie.   I highly recommend this restaurant for meat eaters and veggies alike. There are plenty of tasty gluten-free and vegan choices as well.
