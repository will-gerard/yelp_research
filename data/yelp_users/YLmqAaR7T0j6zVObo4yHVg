I love this one because it is after all the closest one to my house... I just wish that getting a seat was faster, so alot of times we order from home and take it home to eat... That can cause a little confusion though because the register up front never seems to have change... But overall very friendly people....

I love this place!!!! Vintage clothing galour!!! They do have alot of stuff on the racks but I would rather be able to see all of it then miss something that I couldn't live without.... Most shops in the downtown area aside from the restaurants don't have restrooms available for the public and I completely agree with the shop owner I can't stand being followed around like a thief when I'm shopping... When I do get to make it over there I'm always greated with a hello... You have to remember that this is a small family owned and operated business with Vintage clothing (one of a kind stuff) not walmart where they have the same stuff in 20 colors and 6 different sizes... I belive it's all in the name title as far as the sometimes overcrowded racks Matilda's Closet!!! It is supposed to feel like a dream closet with everthing a woman from those eras could have wanted.... As far as dust I can't say their isn't any but it definitely wasn't overwhelming.... Some of the other reviews act like they walked out with Valley Fever come on.... When I am shopping there I am not looking for dust I'm looking for treasures that have history....   Either way I'm pleased with this place they get a thumbs up from me!!!!

I still believe this store is the best to come to if you are looking for well cared for vintage clothing and antiques... They also offer old time photos!!!

Very accommodating family owned business... Not sure they completely understood everything we said but nevertheless the food was amazing... And didn't cost me an arm and leg... I had their gyro and it was awesome... The artwork around the small dining area was enough to be oooohhhed and aaaaawwwwed at but then the food came and we were very pleased... I will definitely return again...

Based on my last visit this store gets a 5 star rating from me... They were on their game!!! Awesome service, great attitudes and wonderful people..... I would return based on my last visit.... I have been to this location before but it has been some time.... Definitely a big change... Restaurant was clean and service was great... I have 3 boys and one of my biggest pet peeves is when the waitress/waiter brings me or other adults at the table food before the kids because by the time they get theirs they have already eaten half of mine... Not this time... Our waitress even came over when she saw the kids getting antsy with some crackers and their sides so they didn't drive me nuts...

Great prices on their clothing.... Sometimes confusing to find things and sometimes hard to find an associate to help you but all in all a great place to shop....

I love Wendy's very much but the only reason they got 4 stars out of 5 is because sometimes in the evening the window cashier is very rude and even yells at you through the box when you're ordering your food... Look people I get it you're working fast food but if you don't like the job, don't get the job... That is all!

Overall great experience... Everyone seemed to keep an eye on their pooch but the amount of dogs humping each other was not to my taste.... I would come back... The park is very large, almost too large.... My dogs like to roam but the amount of people and dogs their was almost overwhelming.... They loved it but I was a bit worried someone might leave with my very trusting dogs.... And the 15 or so little dogs yapping and running back and forth was obnoxious.... But it was still a good evening....

Love this place to pieces.... My dogs thank the person who came up with the idea to make a dog park with a lake for dogs.... Granted the water is dirty and I have noticed there are quite a few owners who don't pickup after themselves or their dogs... There are alot of people like myself who pickup more than a pile or 2 when cleaning up after my own dogs mess... And please people if your dog doesn't like others to the point that you have to pick it up everytime another dog comes by yours and then get upset at the owner of the other dog.... Then don't bring your dog!!!! But overall our experiences here will not keep us from coming back.... The people weren't really interested in talking to eachother but please remember that if you are coming to the lake for dogs be prepared to get in.... If your dog is in trouble in the water you may have to get in to help him and same goes for if your dog is causing trouble in the water....

Great dinner lots of choices... I love their chips and salsa we always get a big side of ranch to dip the chips into (if you haven't tried it, do... very awesome)... I love this one the customer service is always great and we never wait to be seated very long if at all....

I will not be returning to this park ever again!!!! The GROUP of people in the evening that comes with their unruly dogs is absolutely ridiculous!!!! On Tuesday, September 18, 2012 my son was doing what all bored little boys do; making a trail in the dirt.... When this lady's dog Rocko who is part of the Group decided he didn't like him and started to lunge, bark and growl at my child.... I immediately told my child (who wasn't very far from me) to come back because I saw the dog was being very aggressive.... When my son started back over to me the dog began to follow getting closer and closer to him (still barking and growling).... When the dog began to run towards him my son took off screaming for me.... I stood up and before I got to my son the dog grabbed him by the waist and tried to take him down (ripping his shirt, shorts and underwear around his waist along with skin)... I grabbed my son and asked very loudly at the group "Who's dog is this?!?!" several times (while the dog continued to try and get at my son, lunging and barking).... No one answered me, they all acted as if I had no voice and the dog wasn't doing anything..... I was absolutely appalled by this and decided that if they weren't going to speak to me then they would have to speak to the police.... The GROUP then proceded to try and sneak the woman out of the park with her dog....   I would like everyone that reads this post to know that I had NO intention to call the police I just wanted to yell at the woman/ man who's dog it was and tell them to watch their dog or leave.... And I will be the first to tell you that if my son was doing anything to antaganize a dog and the dog bit him that I would have just told my child "well that's what happens when you tease dogs" but on this occassion my son did NOTHING to provoke this dog...  I'm sure I will get some sort of post on here about how this isn't true so to prove it here is my Glendale Police Report number 12-92344... Check it out yourself...

Great place to be in the evening.... Dogs are friendly... People are friendly... Some need to watch their children more and some need to watch their dogs... But Later in the evening it is very relaxing... Love this park!!!! We will be going everyday except Tuesday....

Very unhappy with the experience of having to stand outside forever and then inside... The people inside suck ass as well, very rude inconsiderate and not helpful at all... If you don't like your job find a new one... Seriously...

I love this store!!! I live just around the corner from this store so naturally I gravitated to it when we moved to the neighborhood... The staff is extremely friendly and the store is fairly clean and definitely well stocked... The only negative to this particular store is the cashier openings... Because of the traffic this store gets they only have 1 sometimes 2 registers open... Can be aggravating if there's a rush and you just want to get in and out... But overall this is a great store...

Love this car wash!!! Fast, easy service you pull right up pay and they give you a air freshener and a damp cloth to clean-up the inside... Once you've finished you can pull around and utilize their free vacuums... My car always comes out looking so shiny... And they have a membership... Will definitely return and have already several times...
