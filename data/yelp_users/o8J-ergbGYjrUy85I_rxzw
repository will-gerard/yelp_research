Went to the Body Worlds exhibit yesterday at 10am. It was interesting but I was a little disappointed. I think the first run of this might have been more relevant to my interests. This time, it focused mainly on parts of people rather than whole bodies. Also, it says it focuses on the brain in the ads but there was only a small case of brain-related things.  As far as the rest of the Center goes, I think that if you don't have kids and/or are over the age of 10, nothing here will interest you. It seemed to all be for ignoramus or children. I was bored.

Tucked away into an old central (and scary) neighbourhood, it was a bit hard  to find in the dark. Glad we did, though! Got a lemonade (made with fresh lemon juice), the fried chicken with cheese biscuit sandwich and split an order of bacon cheddar fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a crispy outer breading, thick and juicy meat inside. The biscuit was really tasty and flaky. It came with a few cubes of watermelon but I don't like melon so those went untouched.  We sat inside at the bar and everyone working inside was super nice and friendly. They have quite a few regulars and I could see why. The prices were a bit higher than I expected but they use totally local sourced ingredients and everything is prepared fresh so you're paying for the quality just as much as the quantity.  An order of cheddar bacon fries, a biscuit chicken sandwich with watermelon side, lemonade, and tip totalled to just over $21.

I've eaten here many times over my life and have always enjoyed the food there. However, I went this past Saturday around 2pm and there was some sort of poker tournament going on with top 40 music playing over the speakers. Not really setting the English pub mood, so that was disappointing. But the food was still good and the service was decent, so real complaints.  I had the bangers and mash dinner and my mother had a Cornish pastie appetizer. The sausage was excellent with brown gravy and onions and the potatoes were very creamy.  Go for the food, not for the atmosphere.

Had a great sandwich here the other week. Got The Doughboy which is turkey, bacon, swiss, and avocado on sliced sourdough, warmed up, and I added a side of chips and a can of soda - just under $8. Also grabbed a slice of cheesecake for less than $2. Everything was really fresh and the service was fast and friendly despite it being busy. There's a reason why this place has been around so long!  They also had a full menu of sliced meats and cheeses for those who prefer making their own sandwiches at home - plus shelves of imported products, seemingly mostly from Sweden. It was nice to see some things I haven't seen since I lived in Finland.  I can't wait to come back and try the Turkonberry or the Wild Turkey sandwiches. Both sound amazing!

It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!

This is the dog's doctor and we're also taking puppy training classes here every Wednesday. The trainer is great and Pip seems pretty happy there.

Don't let the dive bar interior put you off. Even as we walked in, a bar fight was about to happen, but that just added to the experience, right along with the sticky tables and low lighting. The waitress/bartender was really nice and both my mother and I got the burger and fries with sodas. The cook came over and asked us if we were sure we didn't want any add-ons so we just told her to throw some mushrooms on mom's and bacon on mine. She was a proper hole-in-the-wall fry cook with big hair. If laws didn't prohibit it, I have no doubt she'd have a cigarrette hanging from her lips. The food was a surprise. While extremely greasy (you're getting a burger and fries so never expect less), it was also extremely delicious. Perfecly seared, thick-patty burger (with a unique tartness from the wine) on fresh bread with nice thick-cut bacon and great fries. It came with some onions and lettuce to top, also fresh.  A perfect example to never judge a book by its cover. There's a reason this place has won some "best of" awards.

A ton of great bakery options, even late in the day. I got a giant s'mores cupcake (~$4), a mini red velvet cupcake with edible glitter (~$2), and a "Mayan latte" (latte with cinnamon, ~$4). I also got to finish off my friend's strawberry and lemon gelato and they were super fresh and refreshing after the heavy chocolate cake. Everything was delicious!  The store/grocery part itself had a lot more gift items than food, but there was plenty of wine and beer to choose from (though at slightly higher prices than a large chain liquor store). Tons of cute novelty things that were fun to look at before ordering dessert.  There are about three different "locations" inside the one room - LGO Bakery, LGO Grocery, a gelato shop (Grateful Spoon), and then it's connected to the pizzeria. Something for everyone!

Little gem tucked into a horrible shopping centre. I loved that they had the roasting equipment and fresh beans out in the open, as proof they roast their own coffee. They had plenty of roasts on offer as well as some home made treats in the case.  I got an iced mocha and a mini cinnamon roll - both were very good. The coffee was very smooth and rich in flavour, not overpowered by milk or chocolate like some espressos can be. For locally sourced, freshly roasted, the prices are your pretty standard Starbucks prices which is great - I'd honestly expect higher. Definitely recommend if you find yourself in the area.

Brought a friend who's worked for Starbucks for years and she was impressed with the roasting equipment. She asked the barista to try the beans before and after roasting and the girl was very friendly and more than happy to oblige. We didn't realize it was time to close and the barista didn't rush us out or seem exasperated, which gets big kudos from me. Got a small mocha and a brownie, both were great. I love this place!

Went in on a Tuesday evening. Place was pretty empty but that left plenty of parking so I wasn't deterred. Service was also pretty slow for it being empty. The older woman - owner? - who was waiting on some tables took awhile to get to us, though we were greeted at the door. Prices were a little higher than I expected (I was thinking a smaller Manuel's but the prices were a few dollars more than what I typically get there) but my chimi covered in fresh guacamole, sour cream and cheese was delicious. It also had a side of beans covered in cheddar and they were really good. Split a basket of chips with my friend and while the chips were great, I wasn't too keen on the salsa - it was a little more watery and more like pico de gallo than I typically like. I got a water with lemon that was good, it didn't seem like tap.  Overall, I typical Mexican local restraunt experience. Great food but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way for it.

I have been going here for years, and it's hands-down the best subs I've ever had. My favourite is the Midwest's Best. Pot-themed decor shouldn't put off even the squarest of people, they're just delicious subs. Don't forget to grab a goo ball because it's what dreams are made of. And they have Kool-Aid on tap.

Worked there for about 6 months, so I'll try to make this unbiased.  This is a family owned rock memorabilia shop that sells everything from posters, t-shirts, purses, shoes, patches, jewelry, and drinking accessories. They also do special orders and keep a pretty good eye on what sells and what doesn't, so there's always something new and a lot of favourites are always in stock. Some cons: Some of the stuff isn't the best quality for the price and they are overstocked on a lot of things, giving the shop a very cluttered, cramped feel. This sucked for the employees because we had to resort everything on a constant basis, and there was just too much stuff. This might be good as a customer, though, since they have just about anything you could want.  Great place to go if you're looking for gifts and they have a lot of sales items too, so you can get a lot of things for under $10. Think of this place like a family-owned Spencers Gifts and/or Hot Topic.

Never heard of this place before today but I wanted to go somewhere I'd never been. I love breakfast foods so I knew that even if it wasn't the best, I would enjoy it. It's tucked out of sight, near the Holiday Inn on Country Club. It's housed in what looks like industrial office buildings but it's not a well kept secret it seems because the place was packed, but still no wait on a Sunday, mid-morning.  I'm so, so glad I found this place on Yelp. My mother got a plate of cinnamon swirl French toast. The slices of bread were SUPER thick but still saturated with the egg and cooked all the way through. It was served with a honey butter and hot maple syrup and it was so delicious. I got the three meat omelette but after seeing another meat omelette they called The Musketeer, I knew I had to also get it smothered in their hollandaise sauce. I got the Meat Lovers because it also included their honey pit-roasted ham. It was amazingly good and I'll be sure to get hollandaise sauce on all my omelettes now. It was served with a side of "country potatoes" only these were sliced rather than cubed like most places. They were seasoned perfectly and had just the right amount of skin. I also had a slice of what I assumed was in-house baked sourdough toast. It was thickly sliced and just perfect.  Their "famous" desert menu caught my eye because they had a Cinnamon Blackberry Bourbon bread pudding with real whipped crème. It sounded amazing and tasted just as good. I didn't have room for it but I forced it down anyway because it was just so delicious. I definitely recommend this place to breakfast lovers. I can only assume their lunch menu is just as delicious! It was also really fairly priced for the quality (about $8 or less a plate and dessert was $5). I also had a raspberry lemonade which was fresh, not pre-made box lemonade. Thick and sweet with just the right amount of tart and flavour. Perfection.  The wait staff was also super friendly and prompt. I'll definitely be coming here again and again.

I've been meaning to go back to this place for over a year now but I finally did today.  Got the same thing I did the first time - Meat Lover's omelette with added hollandaise sauce - and it was still great. Fast, friendly service, low prices (two people - omelette and a burrito - with a coffee and an orange juice for $29 with tip) and excellent food. I wish I lived closer so I could dine here more often!

Man, I wish I could come here every week!   Came in for my birthday breakfast and got the Musketeer omelette - very good and perfectly cooked with a side of pan-fried sliced potatoes. The coffee was amazing for being plain ol' coffee (it had a brand on the menu but I forgot [again] to write it down).   Right now, they have a bunch of seasonal pumpkin dishes on offer. We tried the pumpkin bread pudding and it was AWESOME. I want to come in soon and try the pumpkin cheesecake pancakes.

I've been eating at this same Filiberto's for over 10 years. It's always fast, always delicious, and always cheap. It's the perfect late night drunk food or something quick and high quality than Taco Bell in the middle of the day.  I always get three rolled tacos with cheese and sour creme with a side 1/2 pint of "Mexican-style" rice. Since last time I've been here - a few years - their oil changed and it tastes a little different but was still awesome.

While working at Shirts and Things, we'd order lunch from here every once in awhile. I'd always get the bread bowl soup and have them put half potato, half broccoli and cheese. A great combination! The bread itself was also good. I would always get the Gobbler too, which is like Thanksgiving between bread: turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing on marble rye. Delicious! The delivery seemed pretty fast but the prices were a little high (around $7 for soup and bread or a sandwich is iffy for me).

Full disclosure, I came here mainly for the name in a tongue-in-cheek joke with myself. To me, Morning Star is an anonym of Lucifer (from the King James Bible) so, while I wasn't completely surprised it was highly Christian-themed inside with painted Bible quotes on the walls and "family" decorations, I wasn't sure why they'd choose to name their cafe that. I'm not Christian myself, so it must have a completely different connotation in other versions of The Book that I'm not aware of without consulting Wikipedia. It was also in a very industrial area, tucked into the outside corner of a warehouse building - easy to miss driving past, between all the semi trucks, even when you're looking for it. They probably get a lot of work and trucker traffic - but with the decor theme and location, it was all a bit confusing. The important bit, the food, was delicious. Very cheap and came out quick. My bacon and cheddar breakfast burrito and coffee were both better quality than I expected. My dad also enjoyed his chorizo and green chile burrito. The two people behind the counter, who I would assume were the owners in this mom-and-pop type place, were very personable and attentive. Overall, a nice breakfast, but I think I'll leave this one to the regulars. There are less  garishly decorated breakfast joints in the area to cater to us heathens.

There was a short line but it moved pretty fast. The grill cook was super friendly and chatted with the line, which all seemed to come out of the New York area, like the griller.  Got two "regulars" with ketchup and a side of fries with chili and cheese. Not sure if it's because I ordered them to go or not, but the chili and cheese both came in to-go cups (with the chili being hot enough to almost completely melt the cup and lid) rather than on top of the fries. The two hot dogs were perfectly grilled and it comes on Aunt Hattie's brand buns - my favourite. I ordered the buns grilled too but because my order was taken by about three different people, that didn't happen. The chili seemed like Hormel brand without beans, but it was great. The side that came with my "chili cheese fries" was more than enough to also pour over my hot dogs. If you're getting dogs and fries, just order one side of each and it'll be plenty. The fries were thin sliced but really good  - perfectly crispy and fresh.  Two dogs, a regular fry, a side each of chili and cheese, and a large soda came to just over $10.  If you're craving for some classic American food, this is definitely the place to go.

The best salsa I've ever had - and the only one I can actually eat by the chipful. The chips are always fresh and never stale. Service has always been fast and friendly. Prices are cheap, especially for lunch.   I usually get the enchilada (ordered with no onions, green sauce) with rice and beans, all around $7.   I could eat here everyday and never want for anything else.

This place is supposed to be super famous for their pies, even appearing on national television shows and places in Phoenix get the pies imported down. However, I couldn't see why. I've had some great pies and while my banana creme pie was pretty great, it didn't blow my mind or anything. It was banana creme with banana slices topped with a hearty helping of genuine whipped creme. Pretty good. The service was fast, too, though I did order a root beer off the pie menu (supposedly "real" root beer brewed local and from a tap or something) but I'm pretty sure it was just a glass of A&W. No froth or in a beer mug or anything like the description read.  For two slices of pie and two drinks with tip, bill was $18. That's pretty extravagant for the atmosphere (think Bill Johnson's or any other "cowboy" steak house) and what we got. I felt cheated, to be honest. Anyway, it was a "been there, done that" sort of thing. No need for a repeat performance.

Took mom out to lunch and told her to pick some place downtown we've never been before. She chose this one based on the history. After reading some of the reviews here, I was a bit apprehensive but decided to give it a go anyway as I was interested in the history of the place as well.  I'm not sure what everyone was complaining about now. Sure, it's not fancy or modernized but it was clean, we were seated and served quickly, and it filled both of us up for under $20. I got the combo No. 4 platter with chow mein, fried rice, sweet and sour pork and an eggroll. The plate was full and I wasn't able to finish! The eggroll was a little too ginger-y but was large and tasty and the pork and chow mein were both really good and fresh. The fried rice was a bit plainer than I'm used to (no veggies or egg) but was still tasty. Mom got the pork lo mein and the plate was heaping - she also couldn't finish. 8 hours later and I feel great, if a little sad I didn't take some of the leftovers home. No ill effects like some reviews below stated.  I suppose if you go to a restaurant for a specific atmosphere, you're going to leave dissatisfied even with good food. However, I could care less about that - I'm at a restaurant to eat, not stare at the walls around me. This place is definitely worth it if you want some fast and cheap Chinese food downtown.

Both of my tattoos were done here so I don't have experience with other tattoo parlours, as an FYI. My first is on my left forearm and was done by Christopher Robin. Anyway, I brought in the design and he was super nice and made sure I was comfortable, as it was my first tattoo. My mother got her first right after and he designed it in 5 minutes and it looks awesome. Very professional, clean, had a light hand, and recommended. My second tattoo was larger and a little more complicated, on the left side of my lower back. Sadly, I don't remember the guys name but he was also really nice and made sure I was ok in the areas the tattoo really hurt. Also very clean and professional with a light hand. I would totally recommend this place for anyone in Phoenix looking to get a tattoo. Ask for Jason or Chris if they're available.

Drove by and mom mentioned that she's always wanted to eat here, ever since she went to high school across the street at the now non-existent West High. With longevity like that, you know they have to be doing something right.  The setup is a bit like Five Guys or Fuddruckers - you walk up to the counter and order your burger and side. You have a choice of bun (white, wheat, onion) and cheese (American, swiss, cheddar, provolone). They call your name and you add your own condiments from the condiment buffet (which doubles as the salad bar). I really like this setup because you get to put as little or as much whatever you want on it. I wish they had some hot cheese like Fuddruckers, though. My burger with fries was $5.99 - they charge extra for cheese and extras like mushrooms or bacon. A soda with unlimited refills (and they have one of those crazy touch screen soda machines) was $1.79.   The burger was excellent quality and cooked just right - though they didn't ask how I wanted it. I guess they do everyone's medium? The fries were thick cut and really good. This place is definitely recommended.

I've had two piercings done at Halo in the past 5 years and both times were awesome experiences. They make sure you're comfortable and readily answer any questions you have without the snootiness you can find at other piercing places. They're super clean, walk you through everything they're doing as they do it, and aren't bad in prices either. My septum was $45 with the ring and my nostril was $25 in '06, also with the jewelry included. I would recommend this place for anyone getting a piercing. They also have a huge case with any kind of jewelry you can imagine including hand-made wood and glass products.  Ask for Ana! She was brilliant. The reviewer below sounds like it was her fault, not Ana's, that the piercing got messed up. And my nose piercing was not "in the crease". Not all noses are created equal, I guess.

Went in here right before lunch to try it out. Got an Indian Taco (which doesn't feel PC but since it's owned and staffed by Native Americans, I guess they can call it what they want) with a drink for just over $5. The fry bread was super soft and not really greasy (like I expected, it being fried and all) with really fresh beans, melted cheese, and lettuce. For having no meat and just being a single taco, the prices are a little steep, but for being a small locally owned restaurant downtown, you can't expect Taco Bell prices. Nice staff, clean building.

Just got back from a great lunch! I got the 1/3 lb. burger with cheddar and bacon. Overall, it was a little greasy but nothing less can be expected from a great burger place. The bun was delicious and the burgers were obviously hand-formed, high quality meat with a tangy taste derived from the wine. I also ordered a side of beer-battered fries with home-made ranch and they were delicious! Very crunchy with a nice layer of batter and the ranch was just the right amount of tart and spice.  Service was prompt and the food came out quickly. You can see where the burgers are made and cooked. They also had Big Sky I.P.A. from Montana on tap. Would definitely recommend this place for a quick, tasty lunch or dinner.

All of the food seemed out of a bag from the grocery store. The fries were unseasoned and crinkle-cut, the meat was very dry, and the pita bread seemed very generic and also a bit stale. The customer service was pretty bad - she had her kid playing on the counter and then started talking on the phone when she handed me her food so it was rude of ME to ask for extra tzatziki sauce for my fries (which was chunky and odd anyway).  Not sure how they're staying in business though there was one other customer in there - it seems they might have wifi for paying customers or he was just killing time on his laptop.  Overall, would not recommend - there are better places just down northern if you're craving Greek.

Since I was a kid, Fuddruckers has been my favourite place to get a hamburger. Their in-house baked buns are the most delicious I've had  and they always cook the burger itself exactly how you order it. I also love that I can put whatever - and however much of - I want on it myself. The seasoned fries are also thickly cut and delicious. Save room for a brownie or cookie - also in-house baked - and you won't regret it.  I always get a 1/3lb. medium-well plain then smother it with hot cheese, honey mustard, ranch or mayonnaise, and shredded lettuce. They'll ask you when you order if you want cheese on it but save the $0.35 and put your own cheese later - they have both normal melted cheddar and nacho cheese at the bar. More cheese and mustard for fries and sometimes I'll even make a little side salad.   Fast, inexpensive, and DELICIOUS.

Worked here for almost two years so I might be a little bit biased, but this is one of the best Zia locations in the valley. The store is kept decently clean (as clean as can be expected for a used record store) and most of the sections are kept in order. You won't get retail for your used products, though some morons seem to think you should, but you get decent money - especially if the store needs what you have. You can find super rare DVDs, CDs, and LPs here but be prepared to dig and get your hands dirty.

I've been shopping here forever but I'd never eaten in their café before - and this is more a review of the café. No electronic store that I've been to besides this one has it's own café. I got a chilled Snicker's brownie (super gooey fudge brownie topped with caramel, nuts, and milk chocolate pieces) and this mocha milkshake... thing. It had a name I've never heard before but it's basically an iced mocha with a few scoops of ice cream and blended - like a Starbuck's Frappachino but much less ice-y and much much better tasting. I'll definitely try to remember to get a coffee next time I need laptop accessories.

Went here two weeks ago for breakfast and forgot to add my review! I've been to a few different locations around the valley but this is the one closest to me. I've eaten here every once in awhile for many, many years. One of the best places for Eggs Benedict. Two toasted English muffins topped with a sweet grilled ham, two perfectly poached eggs, and an amazing Hollandaise sauce. They also have a few different varieties of Benedict but I like to go traditional. Add a side of "country" potatoes for $1 if you get the regular Benedict because it's not included.  Also has good house coffee with cream and a selection of sweeteners. Good service but it's a small place and can get pretty packed with a long line to get in so get there early, especially on Sunday mornings - though they do have self-serve coffee outside to help with the wait.

One star but not based on their food or coffee, but on their service.  Both the website and the sign on the gate said they were to be open Sundays 8am to 3pm but it should say "or whatever we feel like". It was not open and there was no sign explaining why. A simple "closed for private party" sign would have been fine but nothing was there. I went out of my way to come to this shop, making sure before online it was open Sundays. They should note on their website that the hours are tentative and to call ahead, as a warning. This is no way to run a business.

I've eyed The Poisoned Pen as a destination for years now but I actively avoid Scottsdale so it took the newly opened Cornish Pasty Co. two blocks down to get me to visit. Super clean and well organized store, and it's not all mystery! They had a great selection of classics and popular books, as well as a used section and several "general stuff" items. I loved that there's a whole shelf dedicated to Sherlock Holmes! They have a ton of signings and events also, so definitely check out their calendar.  Really lovely place.

I'm a huge fan of soda, so when I found out there was a store that catered to that alone, I knew I had to see it for myself. It's set up like a convenience store but only houses bottles upon bottles (and cans!) of so many types of soda - with flavours and brands you wouldn't even imagine. Most are only a dollar or so, too, so you can afford to try every single thing. I recommend this place to everyone who's a little adventurous in their beverage choices and wants to try something new. Also, they have a website where you can order everything they carry plus some they don't and have it shipped anywhere!

I'm not a beer drinker but the food keeps me coming back. If you order any type of sandwich, make sure you ask for it on beer bread or you're seriously missing out! My favourite is to get the roast beef with au jus on beer bread with a side of beer fries - add cheese on top for more extra tasty calories. My dad loves the beer too so if that's your thing, you won't be disappointed. The atmosphere is also awesome - the porch is kept cool with shade and misters all year 'roud and the inside is dark but open with super high ceilings and large windows. You can see back into the brewing area and there's a million TVs with various games and news on if your conversations ever lull. The wait staff is always nice and prompt with service, too. It's just a great and highly recommended place for natives and tourists alike. They even have breakfast!

Went in on a whim while I was downtown. Didn't know it was only Polish till I sat down because the name denotes all of Europe, and not just Poland. The menu also didn't have a lot of European foods on it, just a few desserts and borscht. There was only one waitress (the owner) and it was really busy due to a lot of special events going on in that area. They really should have gotten some temporary help as I waited a long time to even get a drink and she just kept telling people to sit down "if you're going to stay" but then you ended up waiting forever, wondering if you were even noticed. I got a turkey and cranberry sandwich on ciabatta - not really European at all! - and while it was a good size sandwich, it only came with a small bag of Lays and a pickle spear for $7. Way expensive for something I could have easily and cheaply made myself. They wouldn't let me get just half a sandwich and a bowl of soup for a set price ("We don't do half.") which would have been a lot more satisfying to both me and my wallet. The tea - a Polish brand fruit herbal tea - was really good and decent priced. They also had a few Polish brand items on a shelf you could buy (I bought a box of the tea for only $2.99).  For the service and the prices, I won't be back (around $15 for a sandwich, tea, and a box of tea that took over an hour to get and eat... no bueno). Decent sandwich and cute house, but they need to rethink their menu a bit before I'd even recommend this place, much less come back.

Loved this place! I've driven to San Diego from Phoenix hundreds of times over my life and I didn't even know this place existed until it was recommended by a co-worker for my last road trip.  Stopped here early Wednesday morning and it was pretty empty. The decor is really cool with glass etchings of space motifs and a giant mural of an Enterprise-like ship. Now, I came here for the kitschiness of it and didn't expect much out of the food, but was totally surprised! My breakfast was REALLY GOOD! It came out fast with friendly service and was a good size for the price. Got two eggs over easy on toast with cheese, crispy bacon and hash browns, and coffee. Everything was cooked perfectly and I loved the plates! Would definitely stop here on my next road trip out west.

Boss brought in donuts for us and they were some of the best donuts I've ever had. The best was definitely the one with apple pie filling with a glaze and sprinkled cinnamon on top. It's out of my way to get for myself but I've got my fingers crossed the boss treats us again soon.

Pretty pricey for what you get, too dark with too loud music that you can't actually talk to your friends, really weird and off-putting menu items...  I got the FEZ burger (grilled angus burger with spicy honey molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, lemon garlic aioli, crispy onions, & cilantro) which sounded really weird but intriguing. The spicy sweetness of the BBQ totally overpowered everything else -  I couldn't even taste the pears and lemon garlic which were two of the main eye-catchers in the description. It tasted just like any other BBQ and onion burger. I also split the rosemary garlic fries with my friend and they were basic fries sprinkled in garlic salt - way too salty to even taste the garlic. I was not impressed.   Also, I really hate at restaurants when you ask for a box for your left overs and the waitress takes your plate out of your sight instead of letting you put your own food in the box. All she put in was half my burger when I had bits of the other half and salad also on my plate. Super peeve of mine!

Super friendly staff and excellent food.  Got a plate of scrambled eggs with bacon, home fries and a slice of sourdough bread. The bacon was super thick and excellent quality with a distinct maple flavour. The eggs were also perfectly cooked and fluffy and the homefries had onions and rosemary, also awesome. The bread was obviously freshly baked, super thick and came with butter and a side of fresh whole blueberry preserves. The coffee was ok but it was cool that it was local (from a Casa Grande roaster).  Two meals with coffee under $25. The wait (about 20 minutes inside) was worth it.

This place is still here but they expanded, so it's under a different address.

Went tonight for a late dinner on a whim. Glad I did! The inside is really cozy and we had fast, excellent service even on a Saturday night. I got the meatloaf sandwich which was awesome - not just typical meatloaf but also with bacon and corned beef mixed in. Served with aged cheddar on sourdough with a side of mashed potatoes. Delicious with a Strongbow cider. An Irish-style band played that night too - live music is a plus. Will definitely be back.

Went around lunch today and got a blended double chocolate mocha. The staff were really nice and the building is really cool, but my coffee was more of a milk shake than any sort of blended coffee - I even asked to make sure it was made with coffee. It had no coffee flavour at all and certainly wasn't "double chocolate". I loved all their different seating, the vintage cash register and even one of the coolest bathrooms I've ever been in, but if I'm going to pay nearly $5 for a 16oz drink, I want it to taste amazing. Was also disappointed that they didn't have any real selection in the bakery case - it was all sandwiches, breads, and a tarte (which looked good but was also overpriced). They apparently won some prizes for "best cupcake" or something and there were NO cupcakes in the case when I went in.

Scandinavian cuisine is probably the hardest thing to find in Arizona so when IKEA was built a few years ago, I was an immediate fan. If you've lived in Finland or Sweden, this is a bit of nostalgia that you have to have at least every once in awhile. Pass over the typical cafeteria fair offered for Americans and go for the meatballs and mashed potatoes, a classic Scandinavian meal. You eat it all together - scoop up a meatball covered in gravy and top it off with a bit of the potatoes and lingonberry sauce. Delicious! The lingonberry drink is great to mix with either carbonated water or a bit of Sprite to make it more of a soft drink than juice or grab a bottled cider and don't forget to grab a "princess cake" for dessert. You'll feel like you're far north rather than in the middle of the desert.

Ended up here last Monday after we found Solo Cafe was closed, but I'm glad we did. I tried the Aztec Mocha, a Europa, and a breakfast brioche.  The microwave to warm up your brioche or other pastries is at the cream bar so you can do it yourself. I actually like that because some places can't/won't heat stuff up or make it too hot/cold.  The brioche was light and fluffy though wasn't as filled as I would have liked. It was a really nice morning snack than the usual bars and pastries. Definitely give them a try. The coffees were really good but a little cooler than I usually prefer, though it was okay to be able to drink right away without having to scald myself. I preferred the Aztec over the Europa but I'm glad I ordered both.  Nice little local coffee place hidden in a strip mall.

Delicious! Perfect Sonoran cuisine at really great prices.  6 taco basket, loaded nachos and a cheese crisp plus three drinks for around $40.  Service was super friendly and it was luckily not too packed on a Sunday afternoon. Would definitely come here again.

Good, fairly priced Chinese. The egg drop soup was a little flavourless but the chicken (we got House and w/ broccoli) was good quality and both came with a pint of rice each. I'll come back to try more of the dishes.

This place is really made for the collector. Tons of rare LPs and out-of-print CDs that you can't find anywhere else. This is also the place to go for lesser known bands or local artists that you'd have a hard time finding otherwise.  I've had both bad and good experiences with the clerks. Sometimes they can't be bothered with you (one woman a few years ago was on the phone the entire time we were in there and didn't even acknowledge our presence) but then the young man that was in there last night was super nice and not pretentious at all. I've never traded (I always use Zia for that) so I don't know what kind of money you get but I'm sure you'd get a lot more for rare stuff. Don't bring your Britney or Kanye here.  This is the place to go for music lovers!

Had dinner at this place tonight and want to go back again tomorrow... and maybe every day after that.  I had the Sheppard's Pie pasty (hamburger, cheddar, mash, carrots, and peas) served with a side of their wine gravy. It was so delicious. My friend had the bangers and mash and their sausage was so incredible, I was jealous and plan on getting that the next time. We also had the apple pasty for desert which is about half the size of the meal pastys but came drizzled in caramel and with a size of vanilla bean ice cream and real whipped cream. SO GOOD! They also serve hard cider which is somewhat hard to find in Arizona, so that was a definite bonus. They also had a few other import beers on tap or in bottles as well as a full bar.  Super friendly staff, excellent prices (each meat pasty is around $7 and it's totally worth it), and a great atmosphere.  Completely recommend this place to anyone!

Had the meat and cheese pasty and the banaoffee pie again. Still just as good.  Really busy for a Thursday night and a little slow on the service because of it. Enjoyed it much more the other times when sitting at the bar, so definitely suggest doing that if it's available. Also, disappointed in the music choices - it was like swing jukebox music and did not fit the restaurant at all. While the food is super delicious, for the price (~$8.50) the pasties should come with a side of mash or something.  Definitely do not pass up on dessert either.

OllieCake and Urban Cookies are housed in the same building and come from the same till but since I got a cookie and a cupcake, I'll review them separately.  We arrived later in the day so they were out of a lot of the flavours I would have normally desired (no banana, no lemon, no peanut butter, etc.) so I got the strawberry cupcake.  It was strawberry/vanilla white cake with a strawberry-flavoured buttercrème frosting. It was alright tasting - but definitely not worth the $2.56 price. The cake was smaller than other places I've tried and both the cake and the frosting had a greasy, heavy feeling. I love butter as much as the next person but this had way too much. I prefer a light, fluffy cake.   Later, I tried bits of my friend's selection and the chocolate varieties were way lighter and tastier. The vanilla cupcake had the same heavy, greasy feel as the strawberry. I think, for being such award winning cake, they need to work on their recipe a bit. Less heavy crème, oil and butter, more eggs, perhaps.

OllieCake and Urban Cookies are housed in the same building and come from the same till but since I got a cookie and a cupcake, I'll review them separately.  The cookie selection is housed in jars next to the till. There were plenty of flavours left despite us arriving later in the day. I went with the sea salt chocolate. Usually, when you get something with sea salt on it, it's just sprinkled on the top but this had the topping PLUS sea salt mixed in. It made for a ridiculously salty cookie, especially after having the heavy, sweet cupcake. It was also on the drier, and smaller, side. Definitely not worth over $2. Offer a larger, softer, fresher cookie and I wouldn't feel so ripped off. Also, stick to a simple sprinkling of sea salt and not a ton in the batter.

I've eaten here for years. I love their bean dip and green chili salsa that comes out with the free chips. I always get the chicken chimichanga with spinach white cheese sauce (see "Special Chimi" on menu). So delicious and the only Mexican food place I know with that kind of sauce. I recommend this place to anyone in the East Valley area.

Though the prices were a little high for my meager budget, it was freakin' delicious. I can't wait to go back and try their other menu items. I also love the old time burger shop feel to it without that trying-to-hard look, like a lot of diners.

Had coffee and the Breakfast Scramble. Their description: "A croissant topped with scrambled eggs with spinach, ham and melted cheese, then topped with hollandaise and served with fresh fruit." The croissant wasn't toasted and the eggs were a little runny (which I don't like in scrambled eggs), but it was otherwise pretty tasty. The "fresh fruit" was just three cubes of watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe. I hate melons so I couldn't eat any of that - and the description should read "fresh melon" and not the much broader term "fruit". The home fries - cubes of pan grilled potatoes - also tasted like they had been sitting under a lamp for a bit before I got to them. The coffee was pretty good for a diner and they had different flavoured creamers which is always a bonus since I hate regular ol' half-n-half. However, the waitress was a little slow on refilling the carafe as well as bringing the requested water (which was definitely tap). It was not busy at all. $27 pre-tip for basic coffee and two breakfast plates. Yikes. Over all, this is basically a Denny's trying to be trendy. I've had better food (and service) at iHop.

I love Ben and Jerry's from the grocery store so I was excited to find out that there's an actual B&J store here in Arizona.  Went today and the place was dead - we were there for at least 30 minutes and only one person came in. We were mostly alone with the one clerk the whole time. The ice cream was good - it's just Ben and Jerry's as expected - but it came in a nondescript styrofoam bowl instead of an actual B&J paper bowl like is advertised right on the counter. They also had a limited selection. I expected to see something new or different that you can't find in the grocery but it was the same 12 flavours you see everywhere. They didn't even have either of my two favourites (Cinnamon Buns and  Brownie Batter). They have a full Green Mountain Coffee Roasters stand and I got a small cup of house to go with my ice cream. They only had half in half and the coffee also came in a cup you can buy in bulk from Cost Co. I had to put in some of my ice cream to flavour it up, but the coffee wasn't burnt or too watery, which was good. Overall, pretty disappointing. I can go to a grocery store and buy a pint and have more of an experience than coming here. It's probably cheaper that way, too. Note: Something different was they have decks of Trivial Pursuit cards out for the bored which was nice since I love trivia.

Typical Mexican fast food place. Got the carne asada fries to go and they were really good - tons of meat with guacamole, cheese and sour creme. It was a to-go box full of fries and toppings for under $8 and it filled me up, which isn't easy!

It's hard for me to not compare a brewery to Four Peaks since FP is the best of the best, at least in Arizona. The food here was good but nothing special - I had the chicken ciabatta with aioli and bacon. The aioli sauce was sort of like barbecue mixed with mayonnaise or ranch. The bacon was really good - very thick and probably apple wood. The ciabatta was soft but not toasted and just very... not good, not bad. I probably won't be coming back but it was nice to try something new.

I've never been to this location - previously had only been to the one in Chandler - but I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the west Valley. The food was amazing - I had a bacon calzone that was STUFFED with cheese and then cannolis for desert - and the service was excellent. They say give about 30 minutes for a calzone because they bake it fresh and to-order but I got mine in about 15. The waitress put in the wrong sauce - they ordered a white pizza, got a normal one - so the waitress gave them the messed up pizza and cannolis for free but got the ordered pizza to come out promptly in no time at all. NYPD has the best pizza I could hope for from a chain!

Beautiful building and a real Phoenix treasure. I've been going to their gift shop for years, even when it was still located at Dunlap/I-17. Lots of gifts and memorabilia from Ireland as well as the various countries of the UK. The main owner/organizer is very nice and seems to have dedicated his life to bringing the Irish history of Arizona to the people. Went in today to have a gander at the tea selection and two older Irish gentleman were working. It was great to listen to some stories and some Irish language while looking around the shop. Only wish more people cared about this place so that it could grow a bit more.

I have been going to Coffee Rush for YEARS since my dad lives right around the corner. I've filled up my share of stamp cards with my own money spent here time and again. However, tonight I brought in the last card I had filled - stamps I earned fair and square - and the baristas (two I've never seen before - they seem to have a high turnover lately...) both said they can no longer accept the card because some douchecanoe stole the stamper and some "loyalty" cards two months ago (I'll note that I have been here in the last two months and this is the first I've been told of this). 1. It's not my fault that you kept the stamper within arms reach and didn't pay attention, 2. it's OBVIOUS these cards I brought in were NOT stamped at the same time right before I brought them to you. You should never punish your customers for something one guy did. It's just bad customer service. It's really not my fault that I live in central Phoenix and your only locations are in the east valley so I don't come often enough to see "signs on the door" telling me of the change.  I'll still come here because it's great coffee with a nice vibe, but I am pretty disappointed (see: pissed) that I was treated like the theif instead of the loyal customer I am.

Though a bit pricey with not a lot of options, their burgers are juicy and delicious. It's a higher quality, thicker patty on a well made (though not in-house) bun. I get mine with just lettuce, mayo and cheese but you can get it loaded with toppings for the same price. I also got skinny fries but there are also a lot of fry/side options including steak fries, onion rings, or a salad.  If you got a little extra to spend but still want a fast burger, Fatburger is the place to go.

Went on a Monday night and it was very quiet as far as people go, but they play punk, ska, and similar on the speakers. After sports were over (around 10), the barkeep put on some Japanese gore movie on the DVD that was very entertaining. Prices seemed fair, even cheap. Very friendly bartender and seemed like a great place to just hang out with friends and play pool or chat. Probably wouldn't go here on a busier night like a weekend but it was nice tonight. And, bonus, they have absinthe!

I've never actually had authentic Middle Eastern food before so I have nothing to base this on, but it was delicious and filling!   Got the "shawerma" which seemed like mostly beef (it says beef and lamb on the menu but not having lamb before, I couldn't tell the difference), marinated and grilled, with a side of Greek salad (basically a regular ceasar salad with tomatoes, feta, and pickled turnips). It came with a side of super soft, delicious pita bread - which is baked fresh every day. I made a sort of taco with it and it was amazing.  The meat pieces weren't quite what I expected (my knowledge of shawarma comes 100% from The Avengers film so I expected shaved meat wrapped in a lefse served in foil) but it was more akin to carne - but marinated and cooked to perfection so absolutely NO complaints here. The food was super fragrant in the best way and a little food filled me up. We also got the lemonade which won the New Times Best Of Phoenix award. It's fresh lemonade with rose water, honey and orange water (?) instead of sweeteners/sugar. It has a very strong honey flavour and is almost like drinking incense. It made my breath smell great after the shawarma and was really unique and delicious. Free refills too!  Because we mentioned it was our first time, the owner offered Turkish coffee and their baklava - super delicious! The coffee comes in this cute tiny cup and has cardamom (one of my favourite spices!) in it and the baklava was super good. The filo was perfectly flakey and the honey was top quality and fresh.   All that food and drink for under $13. AMAZING.  They also have a few aisles of imported and in-house foods. I got a pretty large bag of pitas, a 16oz thing of fresh hummus and a bag of super soft "cracker" bread (markook? chapati? I'm not sure what it's actually called because it wasn't labeled) for under $12.   I'm super impressed with this tiny local shop/restaurant and I will definitely be back!

Tons of great stuff for the collector of rare, stylised toys. They have small items for $7 and all the way up to much larger, custom designs for as much as $500. Don't come in expecting to get your kid something - this is definitely for collectors only. I love to go in and just look at it from a gallery perspective. Tons of wonderful art for art's sake.

I got the Torta Mexicana and a lime agua frescas. I must have made the wrong choice in torta because it was pretty boring - the meat wasn't really seasoned, the avocado was just lumped on instead of spread evenly, and there were no beans like the menu says. I got it without jalapeño so maybe that would have made the difference but overall, I was pretty disappointed. Also, it was just the torta (only slightly larger than your average fast food burger) and a side of radish and cucumbers (???) that I didn't want and some cabbage/lettuce mix I put on my burger myself for over $7.  However, the agua frescas was DELICIOUS.  I would come back and try to make a better choice but overall, a pretty disappointing experience that left me unsatisfied and $12.50 poorer. You've steered me wrong, Man vs. Food guy.

I went in last night with dad to celebrate International Beer Day. Unfortunately, as my dad put it, Four Peaks is the standard to which I hold all other breweries and their food to -- and SanTan didn't quite measure up, like so many other breweries I've tried before it. First thing I noticed was that the building was super hot - yes it's summer in the middle of the hottest part of the day but air conditioning can simply be turned up to compensate. Maybe they're trying to be more green? But 100+ bodies drinking beer in August in Arizona does not a comfortable environment make. Not to mention it was SUPER LOUD. The acoustics of the place were terrible for that mass of people talking at once. I couldn't speak to my dad without yelling in his face. I don't want to feel like I'm at a rock concert when I'm trying to enjoy some company for dinner.  As for the food, it was happy hour so I went for two starters as my meal, at $5 each. I got the Downtown Sliders - three mini-burgers with beer-braised onions and a handful of beer-battered fries, added aged cheddar cheese for $1 (!?!?). Also went for the hummus plate that came with a few vegetables, beer bread and a handful of mixed-colour corn chips. The burgers were juicy and the onions were awesome. The fries were also pretty good but could have used some seasoning. The hummus was awesome - it was like an guacamole/hummus mix. The chips were also pretty good but I doubt they make those fresh in-house. The beer bread, something I expect on-hand from all breweries that serve food, was a disappointment. It was more like a really thick tortilla. The flavour was that of just flour tortilla and it was a little too tough, even after being soaked in juices (dad got the cheese steak sandwich with beer bread rather than a hoagie).  They need to use more beer and/or water to make it fluffy and soft (see: Four Peaks' recipe). Also might have helped if it had been served hot and fresh? Who knows how long it had been sitting waiting to be served.  I also tried the SanTan HefeWeizen Wheat which is a yellow beer with an after taste of spice and bananas. It would have been great with a warm banana and/or chocolate-based dessert! Though I didn't go for a desert this time (I think they only had a choice of a banana split for dessert and I'm not a fan).   Two appetizers, two beers, two samples of beer and a regular meal plate all for $35 is an awesome price and brings them back up to 4-stars. However, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Work on that beer bread and we'll see.

Got "The Clucker" - a bacon and egg sandwich with arugula greens, cheddar and mayonnaise on a plain bagel - with a "Yin Yang" latte (dark chocolate/white chocolate combo). The sandwich was excellent and very fresh though I'm not a fan of bitter arugula leaves. However, no real complaints. The latte was a bit bitter but I think that's because it was dark chocolate syrup instead of milk choco - I'll ask for that next time. Very decent pricing for being a local shop - unlike too many coffee places down town. Also enjoyed the quirky decor. Wish I had tried to ice cream as I hear it's excellent.

Reminded me a lot of Coffee Rush in Gilbert/Chandler... Up to 32oz for iced coffee and decent prices. Fast service with plenty of treats (we got a chocolate chip cookie which has a surprise cinnemon and... banana? flavour). A bit hard to find as it's tucked in the corner of a small shopping centre but just look for The Codfather on the northeast corner when driving.

Service was awesome, food was amazing and decently priced, décor - both in and out - was beautiful. This is definitely a new favourite and I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys both traditional and original Irish and UK food. We got the sample platter #2 which included awesome fried chicken, spicy mashed potato and cheese balls (AMAZING with the spicy ketchup), sweet potato fries, and grilled chicken sliders. It was happy hour (I think Sundays only?) so I also got a snakebite pint (cider and Guinness) for a mere $3. This is probably the most/only authentic Irish restaurant in Phoenix. I will most definitely come back!

This is a stereotypical "Irish pub" (though it feels more Scottish in theme) in Phoenix. It's a themed bar with American food with only the occasional British/Irish-inspired entrée (your normal Shepard's Pie or pasty among normal burgers and fries). The décor is definitely more interesting than the menu. To top it off, the wait staff is 99% female in skimpy plaid school girl style outfits that only appeals to a certain (male, horny) demographic. If I want Irish food, there are way better, more authentic places close by.   However, with that said, the garlic parmesan fries are pretty tasty and the burger patty and bacon were both thick and cooked perfectly to order. Can't speak for the alcohol selection because I've never ordered any here (I only come here with my dad since it's decently priced and right next to his house) but he's never complained.  This is a sports bar, not an Irish pub by any means. If you want sports and boobs, come here. If you want good food and atmosphere, go to Cornish Pasty Company or even Fibber Magee's, both just a few miles west.

I've wanted to try this place for awhile so I was excited to finally have the chance. The building is really cool with a ton to look at - old plates, signs, stickers, etc. There's mostly outdoor seating so this wouldn't be the best place to go to on a really hot or rainy day, but today was perfect for it. The two guys working were really nice and helpful, which is always a plus. The menu is pretty basic - several types of tacos and burritos but nothing too crazy or complicated. I got the three taco plate - three tacos with cilantro, onion, tomatoes, beans, rice, cheese on a flour tortilla with your choice of meat - for a mere $5. I was expecting them to be small or flimsy at that price but I could only finish two! Well, after my "magic brownie", that is - which was awesome and baked locally. They were LOADED with toppings and meat. The meat was very juicy, the toppings fresh and the tacos come individually wrapped in foil with a slice of lime and a side of a mild salsa.  Three delicious carne asada tacos, two fish tacos for the mom, a brownie and a bottle of water for less than $15? I will definitely be back!  P.S. Remember, CASH ONLY!

In my last review I mentioned the taco plate was $5, it's actually $6 - either I got it wrong or they raised the price a dollar since January. I still recommend it as they are pretty loaded with fresh ingredients and really good tortillas. I usually get one carne, one chicken and one pork - but the chicken is my favourite as the chunks of meat are HUGE and cooked to perfection. It's sure to fill you up.  One note: avoid the frozen lemonade. I was expecting a generous sized fresh lemonade slushy with a lot of flavour (I ordered blueberry) but what I got was a 24oz paper cup with Minute Maid lemonade, too much ice and hardly any extra flavour. Definitely not worth $3.  Minus one star from my last review for the pricing. "Outrageously" yummy but also some things are outrageously priced. You'd think that accepting cash only and charging no tax would also keep the cost down.

For $3, you get a bacon-wrapped hot dog in a delicious bun (all the "cloud"-referencing reviews aren't inaccurate) topped with beans, mayo, and tomatoes. They also throw in sides of a watery guacamole sauce (it's not bad, just watery so you can pour it over your dog easier), two different kinds of cheese, and salsa. Delicious and a good price.  It was a little hard to find in the dark because I was expecting an actual shop, not a food truck, but they're always in the same place (their shirts and truck even have Indian School & 40th St. written on it).

Went here last Friday evening with my dad for father's day. I usually go to the one in Tempe (where I've never had as many issues) but chose this one because it's a larger building and closer to dad's place.  As soon as I walked in, there was a weird smell. It wasn't a food smell but a people smell (an intimate people smell.... ugh). I assume that was because of the cooling issue, which I'll talk about further on...  I opted for sitting at the bar because it was pretty full and a little too warm to sit outside (though there were plenty of people far braver than I). Also, when I've sat at the bar in the Tempe location, the employees have always been jovial and friendly and up for a good chat. I wasn't so lucky this time.  For starters, we got the creamy tomato soup. It came with croutons and a few slices of home-made soda bread and butter. I've never ordered their soups before and it was awesome! I'll definitely get this next time I eat at the Tempe one.  Main course: dad got the Philly cheese steak pasty (he's not one for tradition, I guess) and I went for my favourite - meat (2 types of pork sausage) and cheese. I also got a side of the home-made baked beans. The pasty, as usual, was really good but the baked beans were gross - dry and just all the wrong flavours. I much prefer canned, I guess. They were either in the oven too long or had been sitting out... just not fresh. While the food (minus the beans) was good, the building was super hot. It was pretty crowded and we were sitting by the bar where all the ovens and things are, but they need to definitely invest in a better cooling system with more vents or something because it was almost unbearable - and it wasn't even in the triple digits outside yet. I can't imagine eating there in the middle of the summer!  Also, service was really spotty. What I presume was the owner (or at least a manager) came by a few times and we had our plates cleared but we were sitting on the end of the bar right in front of a girl making fillings and she didn't say a single word to us the whole time. I wanted some HP sauce and I couldn't get her attention since she didn't bother to look up once. I get that you're busy but you're still an employee and it's still part of your job to handle some customer service. Even a smile would have been nice, but was perhaps too much to expect from a restaurant that hires only 20-something hipsters and hippies (and I don't mean that insultingly, it's just facts). Perhaps I'm getting old in my young age. Also, that HP sauce I wanted? They were out of because of "supplier problems". You know they sell it at every Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and World Market, right? You don't need to import it yourself and if you're out of an English staple in an English restaurant, at least go out and buy a few bottles till your "supplier problems" are handled. Just a suggestion. I'm sticking to the Tempe location in the future. You can't keep me away from my pasties so easily.

Four years later and it's really improved. I didn't even think I'd been to this one before until I saw my 2011 review. I really like the decor and the servers were friendly. Also, there wasn't a heat problem like I wrote about before (though it's a much cooler time of year). Good location, though the Scottsdale location is now my favourite with its amazing patio.

As soon as we walked in, we got an "Aloha!" and the great customer service didn't stop there. The husband/wife duo was super helpful and as soon as my mom said we'd never been here, he was quick to point out all his favourite drinks plus their frequent buyer program. I had the Pele's Cup which is a normal mocha but with cinnamon mixed in. It was really great - they use coffee actually from Hawaii and it was woody and nutty, a very great coffee flavour. The only thing was that the final sip was more cinnamon mud than coffee but that can be solved my stirring it as you drink, instead of just letting it settle like I did. Then, since we had sat down to wait for our drinks, the guy brought them right to us. Great service! The decor and music was completely themed making you feel as if you were at a tiki bar on the beach in Maui, not in the middle of Phoenix. Great alternative to Starbucks or It's a Grind! I'll definitely be going back.

I used to frequent this place years and years ago when it was Le Petite Café so decided that I might as well try this new place. It's completely gutted from when it was the other restaurant and has a very open but hipster feel to it. The menu is on boards as soon as you walk in and you go further up to place your order with the waitress. Number in hand, you sit anywhere and someone delivers the food when you're ready. I've been to places like that before but it's still a weird concept for a "sit down" place. I got the Sunrise Sandwich which is basically runny eggs and ham with cheese on toast and a side of pan-fried rosemary seasoned potatoes. The sandwich was really good with plenty of ham and a lot of flavour but, and I say this as a potato lover, the potatoes were not edible. They were rubbery and flavourless like they had been sitting under a heat lamp all morning. This wouldn't bother me from a place like Denny's but if I'm going to be paying nearly $8 for something I can make at home at a fraction of the cost, I expect high quality and flavour. Also tried the Italian coffee and cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was very fluffy and had a good helping of frosting on it. I liked that they didn't melt the frosting over it. The coffee was very good but a little costly at over $2 for self-serve no-frills coffee. Even Starbucks is cheaper than that.   Overall, much left to be desired. Decent food but I've had more satisfying experiences at iHop at much better prices.  I can only assume all the high ratings are from people who aren't super into breakfast like me. It's my favourite meal so I know when it's lacking. I'll continue mourning the loss of the little cute France-themed breakfast joint that was.

Too bad my 200th review is for this place.  Typical American "Irish" bar. The music selection was good but not right for the environment. Service wasn't attentive. My booth seat was caving in around me. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting. A very small whiskey cranberry was $7.  Bottom line, I won't be back.

Parking is a little odd if you're just running in. I "borrowed" one of Joe's BBQ's 15 minute pick-up spots and ran up the street to Bergie's. I didn't see till after that there was a parking lot and more street parking behind it!  This is a really cute shop made out of an old house. It has a huge outdoor seating area in the "front yard" and is easily handicap accessible. The whole family was in today and my seasonal iced salted caramel coffee was made by the owner. It had the perfect amount of creme and caramel flavouring and was totally worth the $1.75 I paid for a large (Usually only $3.50 but it was half off when you checked into Yelp for the first time!). Also be sure to grab one of their little scones for just over a dollar - cranberry nut, chocolate chip and bacon cheese were today's offerings. The choco chip one had a generous amount of chocolate and was very soft and not overly sweet. Perfect! I wish this place was closer! I'd definitely recommend it if you're in the area.

Went in for some coffees after having dinner at Hula's next door. They were getting ready to close but the guy was nice about it and still made a perfect mocha. Didn't get any pastries/cookies but what they had left looked pretty good. Prices are a bit high for the size but for a locally owned shop and a really fresh, well brewed coffee, it's worth it. The decor is awesome and the current artist on display had some really cool stuff that added to the atmosphere of the place. A little too trendy feeling but not really something to complain about. Would definitely go back to try the Matador (cinnamon mocha) or the orange mocha.

Absolutely loved this place and am only sad that it took me so long to try it! I got the chicken fingers with a waffle and a Kool-Aid. I love that you can get Kool-Aid in house as it's one of my favourite drinks from childhood. The waffle was absolutely delicious and HUGE and the chicken was very crispy and juicy. The corn bread was huge as well, and was really good.  The service was also pretty fast and super friendly. If you have any love for rich Southern food, this place is definitely one to check out. I wish there was a closer location!

Went for happy hour yesterday. Had the fish cakes and sweet potato fries. Both were awesome! The fish cakes were moist and seasoned just right so that they weren't fishy but had that seafood flavour just enough that you knew what you were eating. The fries were honey glazed and came with a thousand island type dipping sauce that was a great compliment to the sweetness of the fries. Didn't have any drinks but they had pretty good specials and my friends enjoyed theirs. Nice bartenders, awesome décor, big screen TVs playing sports and Gilligan's Island, and good food. Will definitely be back.

Went in for a Saturday brunch 3/20/11 with madre and had the Island Eggs Benedict (with ham). Perfect. A little sad that the appetizers weren't available as I told her about the fish cakes and fries I had last time. She got the fish tacos and a zombie cocktail though, and wasn't disappointed.   Still a nice downtown place to eat but note that not all menu items are always available.

Third time's still a charm!  This time I got the Luau pork sandwich which is sweet, shredded pork on a bun with coleslaw. I'm usually not a fan of slaws but this one was not too sweet and really complimented the pork. And, as before, the sweet potato fries were awesome with Hula's dressing dip.  Super friendly server on the patio, too. Also used Yelp to get $5 off when I checked in - so without a drink, it was just over $6! Awesome deal. I'll finally give it that 5th star for service, taste, environment and prices.

Got a small caramel toffee mocha and a red velvet cupcake. Also tried a bit of my friend's strawberry scone (she got the same flavour drink). The coffee was really good and smooth - not over roasted or too strong/weak and had a really nice sweet toffee flavour. The cupcake was a little more thick and cold than I prefer (I like my cake more fluffy/airy and room temperature) but was really good and not too sugary. The scone was definitely better, though. The only problem was that the coffees did take a long time to come out and it wasn't that busy, but there was only one barista and I didn't pay attention to the line length. Seems like a great neighbourhood spot, though. There was a live guitar player at the time which was kind of neat but strange on a Saturday morning.

This place is a bit hard to find in the dark if you've never been. I ended up at the library but it's down the street a bit, tucked off the main street.   This place definitely caters to the 'hipster' crowd with a heavy dose of pretentiousness but I've come to expect that from more popular local coffee places. The interior is very modern (though not well-maintained). We came in right before closing so it wasn't busy at all but they still had plenty of baked items in the case. The barista that made our coffees was very nice when my mother asked what ristretto meant (how they make all their coffee drinks, as advertised on the menu) but the other barista seemed very aloof and non-engaging.   My overpriced small mocha would have been a lot better if they didn't use dark chocolate but that's all they had. Is it more hip to use dark chocolate now? I'm a huge fan and frequenter of Dutch Bros. and if you can't compete flavour-wise with a drive-thru coffee place, it's probably time to re-evaluate.  Seems like a good spot to hang out if you live in the area (and can find parking) but I would definitely not come back when there are better options in the same area.

Reading the low star reviews on here is hilarious. These people seem to want to be waited on like they're something special. If you're in a hurry or don't know anything about wine, go to a grocery/convenience/corner liquor store or do a bit of your own research before shopping instead of expecting everyone in the store to know exactly what you're looking for and where to find it.   However, if you're like me and like to just browse and not be bothered every 5 minutes by staff and don't mind being carded (everyone knows that if you're with someone buying liquor, no matter what the store or how old you are, BOTH of you are to be carded so deal with it and make sure everyone has their IDs) then Total Wine is the best place to find what you need. The only qualms I have are the labels for each bottle are very VERY small and the organization is lacking, but for a place that has over 50 types of cider and flavoured beers at cheaper-than-most-soda prices (as well as a few bottles of rare sodas in their non-alcoholic section) it can't be beat. I also really like that you can pick and choose to create your own 6-pack of nearly all the types available and not just the most common brews - BevMo needs to take note and get on this - and that the 6-pack holders are right there in every isle.   I don't go to a store - especially a chain - for the staff, I go to buy the things I want. As long as they have it and it's decently priced, nothing else should matter!

Awesome food at a decent price. Stopped in today for dinner because I've never been and Olive Garden is too far to drive in rush hour. Glad I stopped by! You get a free foccacia bread (freshly baked and very light and fluffy) with a olive oil/balsamic vinegar dip. We got a side of the garlic hummus also and it was awesome. I got a calzone with meatballs, bacon and extra cheese for $11 and it was HUGE and delicious - their mozzarella is very smoky and balanced with the two meats, it was perfect. It came with a side of marinara but was also good with the hummus spread.  Service was a little slow as the place got busier but that's to be expected. I'll definitely be back.

Went last night for Zoe Keating concert. The sound was good and our coffees were pretty tasty (though overpriced) but with our $15 ticket, we didn't "make a reservation" so we were seated on the other side of the bar as far away from the stage as possible. If you're going to pay $15 for an hour concert, it should at the very least include a table in the actual concert area. I thought that was a little ridiculous. They also charged a $4 "service charge" (for what??) on each ticket. Though they have a nice stage and layout, I will never be back.

Pretty tasty, hearty burger with natural cut fries but, overall, nothing really special about this place. The inside looks just like In-N-Out with signs covering the walls proclaiming all the positive reviews around the states it's received - almost like they're trying to pressure you into liking it. Well, it's great that the Washington Post really liked your burger, but this is Arizona and it's nothing new.  The lady got my dad's burger wrong. She and the rest of the staff seemed a bit rushed - it was busy but I'd rather wait for a burger done right than have it rushed through. Dad changed his mind on cheese and never asked for bacon but got both. At least we didn't get charged for them? Burgers came wrapped in tin-foil (mine was also double-wrapped... ok?) and the fries were in a cup, all came in a bag like carry-out whether or not we ate inside. If you think In-N-Out is completely over rated (and it really is) and don't mind not having a drive-thru, this might be an alternative for you. Instead of In-N-Out's super thin burgers and fries, you get two hand-formed patties with free toppings (I got grilled onions and bar-b-que sauce, though both bacon and cheese will cost you) on a normal sesame seed bun. Their fries are also thicker and naturally cut with a nice seasoning.  I spent $20 on two burgers, a reg. size fry, and two sodas. Pricey for fast food style lunch.  I know I've gone a bit back and forth in this review but bottom line: I won't be back.

Got the 20oz "Dirt Clod" - a hot white mocha with a chunk of dark chocolate thrown in. The coffee was delicious! Not too bitter or over roasted. The chocolate didn't really mix in so I got a nice chocolate sludge when I finished the coffee, which I enjoyed. Overall, pretty decent.  The inside really appealed to me - a great space to study or just hang out and read. Tons of cushioned seating, art, and just generally aesthetically pleasing. It felt homey which is always a bonus for a place that you'd want to stay for longer than it takes to get a coffee to go. I'd go here again if it weren't so far away (right across the street from PVCC).

Great service, awesome food. Went here last night with a Groupon and two friends. We sat at the bar and had Rob (I hope I got your name right!) the bartender serving us all night. He was really accomidating and friendly. We got the Swiss cheese fondue (gruyère cheese mixed with white wine and German brandy), Pâté de campagne (2 slices of pork pâté with 2 slices of toasted baguette) , La Potence (a heated mace of filet mignon, flambéed in front of you with bourbon and pineapple over wild rice) and one each of the chocolate ganache, salted caramel, and lemon sugar crêpes. Quite an exciting meal for this chicken and potatoes girl!  The fonue was excellent and we got it with both Golden Delicious apple slices and toast points. The pâté was interesting - I'd never had any before - and it's not something I'd order by itself, but skewer that with some toast and dip it in the fondue, and you have yourself a delicious mini-sandwich.  La Potence is a house special developed by the French chef/co-owner and we actually got to watch the man himself flambé it tableside and fresh. He went through all the ingredients, steps and some tips on eating it as he cooked. Really cool! And so tasty. It was a little more red than I usually eat my steak but I classed it up and ate it anyway. We also ordered a plate each of the different sauces that are made for it. There was a ketchup-mayo frite sauce, a dijon mustard mix, a steak tartar, and a mustard dill sauce. Also came with a slice of rosemary butter that was awesome with the bourbon/steak/pineapple-infused wild rice. It wasn't totally satisfying - I wanted more! - and a little pricey, but for the experience alone, it was well worth it.  My favourite crêpe was also the cheapest and most simple - the sugar and lemon. You can watch them cook the crêpes on the two television screens over the bar which was interesting. You think, "Crêpe? It's just a super thin pancake!" but watching them make them, you can see it's not so simple.  Overall, really nice experience. With the $22-off Groupon, the bill was still over $50, but if you share among friends and split the cost, it's totally affordable.  It is my personal opinion that those below giving horrible reviews of horrible experiences are just too demanding or uncultured. "Raw bacon"? It's called prosciutto. Maybe learn a bit about the world before feeling it necessary to share your opinions with it.

Really austere, creepy interior. It's all white and chrome and too OPEN - gives me a weird vibe. The girl working there was really nice and came right out from behind the counter to offer us samples of flavours. BUT they had hardly any flavour choices I'd want (coconut, pistachio, hazelnut, pomegranate all sound gross). I went with typical salted caramel and vanilla. They had a lot of different toppings I haven't seen at the other yogurt places I've tried (like whole Hostess Zingers and donuts?!) but a lot of the bars weren't chunked up so you couldn't really mix them into the yogurt, just kind of add it to your lot. Overall, another typical yogurt place that's trying to be a little too high-class for what it is.

They have $1 tacos Mon - Wed. Otherwise, I wouldn't go here. It's like the million other -berto's - very greasy, moderately priced and no customer service should be expected. When you need a late night/early morning snack or are just craving super greasy Mexican food, this is your place.

Really hard to find if you're heading east! Just turn on 9th Street and it'll be in the dingy shopping center on the west side of the street (near an "Indian" fry bread place I also want to try).   Having had gyros at a different place earlier in the week, I had something to compare this to (before that, it'd been over 10 years!). These gyros are a little smaller but a lot fresher and tastier. The meat was seasoned perfectly and you could taste it through the fresh tomatoes, onions and tzatziki sauce. I don't mind a little bit of grease because that tells you the meat is fresh and roasted rather than pre-cooked and stored. It also came with really delicious french fries. The hummus was obviously in-house and came with a pita that was steamed so it was very soft and warm. I took it to go and it smelled so good, I almost snuck some on the way home!  The gyro and fries came with a canned soda and was $5.99. The hummus was just under $5. A very tasty, filling meal with drink for under $13 with tax is definitely a win!   Definitely surprised and sad this place wasn't packed on a Friday night around 4. I hope people are just getting take-out because this place deserves to stick around.  I will be back!

Went in around 11:00 and got the cheeseburger combo with fries and a drink to go. The fries are thinly cut and were a little greasy - as fries should be - and really tasty. The burger was smaller than I expected but stuffed with toppings and with both really good quality meat and bread. The burger came topped with tomato, pickle, onion, and lettuce with a thousand island sauce for no extra charge. There was also a bit of pepper on it but I couldn't tell if it was added later or part of the sauce - and you could tell the dressing was definitely in-house made. I really like pepper so I enjoyed it but some might not like it as it was a bit strong. Ask for it on the side if you're not a fan of pepper but do give it a try. The meal also came with a medium fountain soda (normal selection of Pepsi products plus Dr. Pepper and fruit sodas) for a little over $4. Not bad for not being a chain! They had about 6 coolers STUFFED with unique sodas and normal favourites plus candy and nuts also on offer, much like a convenience store. I'm a connoisseur of soda so I've tried most of them but they had quite a few I've never even seen. A bit pricey at $1.85 a pop (no pun intended) but if you want something a little different than the same ol', give 'em a try. I recommend the Jackson Hole Soda Co. High Mountain Huckleberry soda.   Will definitely be back to try their signature Rocket Burgers - a hoagie roll stuffed with hamburger and toppings - and their fresh onion rings.

This place has obviously latched on to me as I went a second day in a row. Still kept it simple and got the cheeseburger combo with fries and a fountain drink since I've overspent my budget this week but I don't plan on this being the last time I'm in, so I wasn't bothered about it. It was a lot busier than yesterday as I was in after noon but my food didn't take any longer to come out. The cook - I think it's the owner! - remembered me from yesterday and was super friendly with some banter as he made my burger. I told him I really liked the dressing with pepper and he said that made him happy. The cashier was probably a student from the high school right behind it and was a little too shy and impersonal, especially next to the cook/owner, but she did her job so no complaints. Still have to try the signature burger and onion rings... next week perhaps!

Over a year later and still great. Went in on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch and got the California burger (sans tomatoes and pickles). The avocado was fresh, the bun wasn't dry, and their "secret" sauce was still perfectly peppery and went great with the avocado and cheese. It's also one of the only places to get a lot of the soda they have on offer and today I chose a vanilla root beer from Barrel Brothers.  It seems that they bought most of the mini-mall they're in so there's more parking and will soon be a lot more seating. Good for them!

Stopped in on a whim and tried the Banana Nana which is banana cake with a Bavarian banana crème filling and banana buttercrème topping. It was very good! The cake was very moist and fresh and it wasn't overly rich but still very sweet, in a good way. I'm not a huge fan of $3.50 cupcakes but it's nice to treat yourself. I'm not a cupcake snob and this is really the first cupcake-specific bakery I've been to, so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but it was delicious and fun to try. I would recommend if you're in the area.

Super friendly staff and decent prices. Got a Four Peaks peach for happy hour at $3 and my delicious Phat Burger (10oz angus, bacon, avacado, lettuce, mayo) was under $10. I added parmesan truffle fries as my side for an addtl. $1. Nice late lunch for under $20!

Went in last night for dinner with my dad. Chris, the bartender, was very nice and attentive but the place was pretty empty so I can't speak for staff on weekend nights. I sampled two different beers and finally ordered one of the specials off the chalk menu (a light raspberry brew I now cannot remember the name of) on the wall along with two appetizers ($1 off for Happy Hour!). The Loaded Baked Potato Fries were pretty good - a plate of battered & ranch-seasoned natural cut fries topped with cheddar, bacon, sour crème, and chives. Also had the Pulled Pork Sliders which were mediocre but not bad - three small hamburger buns with barbecue pulled pork. The sliders could use some toppings like a sauce or cheese, but the bread was good. Dad liked his cheese steak but I didn't try it. On the desert portion of the menu, it says to ask about that week's special desert. It was turtle cheesecake but they were out of it (by Thursday?) and the other options are not interesting (float or "pizza" cookie). There is a huge beer selection that rotates with availability and seasons and free samples of those on tap before you commit to a full glass. Friendly bartender and owner were on hand to answer any questions about the beers. Neat collection of tap handles all around the restaurant.   Overall, nothing really special about this place besides the beer selection and live music (M.T. Rox played live classic rock on a beautiful Ovation for the duration of our stay). There are a handful of flat-panels around the building for game watching with plenty of tables, bar room and a few leather sofas. If I was into sports, it would be a great place to watch a game and have a beer with friends. For someone not into that, however, it's just a place to sample some new beers. I would go again to try their house Mac & Cheese and new beer selection if I was in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way.   Service - 4 stars, Bar selection - 5 stars, food - 3 stars, ambiance - 4 stars. Prices are reasonable. Give it a shot if you live in the area and enjoy drinking.

Super friendly staff who didn't treat me too much like a lost girl (all too common when I go to comic book stores), helped me find the issue I was looking for, and even offered up some info about future comics I'd be interested in (based off my Thor shirt and the Gambit and Hawkeye comics I was buying).   I regret not trying out the coffee! I'll be back next time I'm on that side of town, definitely. I think that's such a cool, uncommon edition to this particular genre of shop.

Took myself to Rocket Fizz today to check out their selection and wow, it was amazing. A  ton of unique sodas, British imported chocolates (including my favourite chocolate in the world, Nestle Yorkie bar from Ireland), a wall of taffy (definitely try the gingerbread flavour if you're into that) mixed with assorted small candies ($3.99 for a medium bag - see photo - as full as you can fill it with whatever out of the bins = awesome deal), and assorted novelties. All the sodas are $1.89 no matter what size which is a little more than I'm used to paying but if you get the 4 pack (also have 6 and 8 packs), it's like buying 3 and getting 1 free which is a pretty nice deal. The guy who was working alone was super nice and funny and let me take home some of the discarded bottle caps for free (I collect them). Most of the sodas are out of the cooler, but they have a few coolers filled as well so you can drink them right away. There's also a lot of sugar free and organic candies for those that need them.  5 stars for selection and service. I'll definitely be back the next time I need a sugar fix.

Got three carne asada tacos and a quesadilla to go. The tacos were your typical street-style tacos like you get at, say, Baja Fresh. Two corn tortillas filled with meat, basil and onion. They were very good and the tortillas seemed very fresh. However, nothing really new there but also no complaints. The quesadilla was unlike one I've ever had, seeing as it's Oaxacan-style. It's more like a masa de maíz empanada filled with cheese and herbs, topped with black bean sauce, lettuce and another white cheese. It was AMAZING, very flavourful and something that I will definitely want to have again.  Three tacos and the quesadilla was less than $7. The prices are very cheap but this is also street food - small and fast, so you get what you pay for. Definitely go in expecting to order a few different things at once. I definitely want to go back soon and try a few other menu items!

Got one of their holiday drinks, a caramel apple latte, and it was SO good. The coffee was perfectly roasted and brewed, and the weird flavour combination of apple and coffee was really delicious. Totally hope to come here again soon! Go here instead of Starbucks or Cartel when downtown!

Went in a few weeks after the first time and got a cannoli and another caramel apple latte. This time, the latte didn't have a distinct caramel apple flavour. The other barista was much better. I had to ask them to put more apple flavour in it and she explained that it's not very strong. I didn't tell her how good the last one was, though... The cannoli was amazing, though. Definitely craving another one of those.

For $10 a person and I hardly ate one plate of food.  There were a ton of options (even really exotic stuff like frog legs) but everything I tried was mediocre to just plain bad. Not sure where these 4+ star reviews are coming from. Have you had real Asian food before? It had interesting décor (huge fountain with real fish, glitter inlay tables) and the staff was friendly enough but the price should be a little cheaper during lunch hours, especially with the quality of food. I'll stick to regular take-out or Mongolian BBQ next time I get a craving for the East.

Some of the best ice cream I've ever had. Super creamy and flavourful home-made taste without being icy or leaving a weird film in my mouth. The prices are a lot lower than I expected, too!  After trying a sample of the "Vietnamese coffee" ice cream (which was delicious but not what I was craving), I got a scoop of double chocolate on a sugar cone with a few pieces of the home-made caramel they had sitting on the counter.  They have a huge list of toppings, candies (normal and home-made treats), coffee and coffee drinks, and baked goods available too. Also, local art if you're into that. I'll definitely be back for more.

Over-priced, mediocre sandwiches and boring coffee. They wouldn't make breakfast after 10 even though they cook it fresh. Is it against some kind of regulation to grab an egg out of the fridge?  If you love this place you haven't really been around. There are much better choices within walking distance.

Great donuts even from a late night drive-thru doughnut run. I love that they're open so late (take note, Dunkin). The only problem with coming so late is that they're usually out of the top choices. Definitely go for a crumble or sourdough.

Recommended to me by my dad, so we went there together this morning. I got the California Eggs Benedict which is the usual Benedict but with cooked spinach, avocado and tomato. I replaced the tomato with Canadian bacon. It also came with a small side of home fries (cubed pan-fried potatoes).The Hollandaise sauce was thinner than I'm used to and had pepper instead of paprika but it was really good. The eggs were poached perfectly and the English muffin was toasted and very good. The fries were a little underdone for my tastes (not undercooked but not browned like I like) and were also seasoned with just salt and pepper - but they were pretty good.  Overall, a very tasty breakfast. I think the plate with the added ham and a large glass of orange juice was under $15, so not bad for the quality and if you really love a great poached egg. They also have t-shirts with cool designs and the inside is very small but clean with super friendly, fast service.  Only 4 stars because while it was good, it wasn't amazing. Thicken up the sauce, brown the potatoes and add a few more spices for that coveted 5th star. Still, check it out when in the area!

Popped in here because Inside the Bungalow was closed and this was the first coffee shop on Main St. we spotted. It did not disappoint! It's a very large space with great art and furniture, but was rather empty - given, we went in on a Friday afternoon. I hope they get more business in during the evenings and weekends so it doesn't disappear like so many other local businesses. The owner was the only one working and was very nice and talkative, you felt very welcome and not looked down on like at some other coffee places. He used a very robust, woodsy coffee for my latte which surprised me - coffee used in mixed drinks usually doesn't stand out so much other than simple coffee flavour. It was very good! There were also plenty of gluten-free and/or vegan baked goods available for those who like that sort of thing. The prices were competitive, too - $3.25 for a 16oz. latte with pumpkin spice flavour added. If this was closer to my house, I would definitely frequent it. I want to go back and try some of the other coffees and the banana chocolate chip muffins I spotted in the case.

Friendly, fast service. Got an excellent 20 oz. caramel cappuccino for $4.50. Just wish it were easier to get to when you want to just run in.

I was a big fan of Lis Doon Varna, the original restaurant that the building was built and housed for some years before its untimely closure earlier this year. It was the most authentic Irish restaurant I've been to in Arizona (see: *most*, though it couldn't be labelled *an* authentic restaurant) and I was really sad it closed. I thought I'd give the building's new owner a try and I can't help but compare it to Lis Doon on every level. The inside is completely the same - they must have acquired all the furniture and fixtures along with the unique building. They seem to have added some random photos and things on the wall (framed ink-jet print-outs of the Kennedy family add a touch of class) to make it theirs but it's mostly the same.  The menu is where things get really different. Johnny Fox's menu is a lot smaller and a lot less Irish. The prices (a bit on the expensive side) are about the same but it seems like it's all the usual "pub food" you find in "Irish" restaurants around Phoenix. Nothing original here and it makes me sad to see things like Alfredo sauce covered pasta on the menu. I opted for a cup of the shrimp bisque and the sausage roll appetizer with a bottle of Magner's while mom went for the cottage pie (misnamed Sheppard's pie on the menu) and house white wine. The bisque was very good and came in a small casserole dish with a handful of soup crackers on the side. The sausage rolls were AWESOME though I'm not sure what type of "sausage" they used - seemed a bit hot doggy but still tasted good. Those were filled with onions, mustard and baked in pastry dough and went well with my cider and bisque. The cottage pie wasn't anything special but was also good. Definitely not worth its $14 price tag, though. I could make better at home for around $5 in ingredients (and who gets the idea that food originally devised for poor people by poor people can be over $10 a plate?).   Service was decent though the waitress was super perky. Pro tip for customer service: If you're giving way more than you get back, maybe tone it down a bit. It just puts the customer off. We were also served the wrong table's plates  and the waiter said, "Ugh, *someone* is putting the wrong table numbers in!" obviously referring to our waitress. Very professional. The food also took awhile (the food wrongly served us would have been about the right time for restaurant food, but ours took another 15 or so minutes after that -  I could only assume ours had been served to someone else) though the waitress did pop by to say our food was on its way instead of leaving us hanging.  Over all, I will very much miss what Lis Doon Varna was and will not be back to this restaurant. The décor alone is just simply not enough to make it worth my time. I'll keep a look out for some real Irish fun here in the desert (though I'm not holding my breath).

Went in a few weeks ago. It's in an old fast food restaurant building (built to be a Some Burros or something similar) so it seems a little strange that they seat you - but it's very open which is nice. The service was really great and I think it was the owner that mostly served us.  The food, however, left much to be desired. Friend and I split an order of Gringo Nachos (fries with cheese, a type of dressing, and onions) which were really good and worth the $6 but The Pig sandwich (pulled pork, hamburger patty and bacon on a roll, $10)... while it had a good flavour, the bread was super tough to bite into much less chew and the pulled pork was a little dry. With a much softer bun, it would have been more enjoyable. I also thought I got a side of mac n' cheese that was decent but it doesn't appear on their online menu...  I really wanted to try the 3-layer Dr. Pepper cake but $7 for a slice of cake I'm not sure I'll even like? No, thank you.  Overall, a bit pricey for what you get. Improve on the bread and lower the prices a bit and I'd give it another go.

Super friendly, fast service. Cute cafe with lots of art and natural light. I got the tomato basil and brie frittata with potatoes and sourdough toast, a side of bacon, and a coffee all for $20 after tip.  The frittata was larger than I expected with plenty of tomatoes and brie. The potatoes are seasoned red which made me a little apprehensive since I can not handle spicy food at all, but they were very flavourful and went down easy. The toast was delicious with a nice creamy butter.  The bacon (an extra at $2 for three pieces) was great and totally worth the price. Very good coffee with unlimited top ups at $2.49.   You can also get your food to-go but if you're not in a hurry, stick around for the service.  Definitely recommend this local eatery. I'll be back to try the french toast!

Had to come back but was a little too hungry to wait for the baked french toast. Soon!  This time, I tried the ham, swiss and spinach sandwich which came on ciabatta with a side of potatoes. The spinach still had the stems which I don't like and wasn't quite as flavourful as I like but, other than that, it was a very filling and delicious sandwich. This time, I couldn't finish my potatoes! Coffee was still good and service was still friendly (with the exact same staff as my visit last weekend). My friend got the frittata I did last weekend and it didn't look like mine had with a lot more tomatoes. Consistency issues in the kitchen?   Still really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back.

A little hard to find but well worth it. Tried a hot mocha, berry spritzer, cinnamon roll, and an apple "toptart" (homemade Pop Tart). Great prices and a homey atmosphere with plenty of tables and a neat aesthetic. The woman working the counter was really nice and the pastries were super fresh and tasty and re-heated in the toaster perfectly without us having to ask. The mocha was really creamy and well made and the berry spritzer was fresh and refreshing. I wish this was closer - I would definitely be a regular.

This is a more unique local business that serves chocolate, European (mostly British) styles foods, and British grocery items.  They have a full menu of breakfast and lunch items but I ordered one of the Scotch egg pasties out of the display cooler along with a lemon bar and Highland shortbread. That, with a large latte, was just over $12.   The pasty was pre-made and warmed in the oven so it came out fast and was so good. Very soft, perfectly baked pastry crust with a sprinkling of pepper and salt on top. The Scotch egg inside (hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage) was delicious. The sausage was perfect and not at all greasy and the egg was cooked just right. The lemon bar was more of a type of lemon curd oat cake instead of just being the typical lemon-y gel stuff over graham cracker crust and was really good. I like that it was more hearty than your average lemon tart. The shortbread was a little harder than I like but has nutmeg and cinnamon in it and was great when I dipped it in a hot coffee I made myself later. The latte was great too. It wasn't anything special but wasn't too milky and the coffee wasn't bitter which is all too common in less-commercial coffee places. Just right.  You can see right into the chocolate-making area and there were a bunch of different types including these huge high heels made of chocolate. Really cool! I, unfortunately, didn't actually sample any of their chocolate but I'll be back for that sometime hopefully soon.  As I was in and eating, two different people came in and were obviously regular how they chatted with the owners. It was nice to have that real mom-and-pop-shop feeling there.  I definitely hope this place sticks around! I don't frequent this area of town but if I lived over there, I'd certainly be a regular.

While the prices are a little high (if it wasn't for Happy Hour, I would have blanched at the prices) the service was very friendly and the food was good. We got three HH plates at $6 each - chicken street tacos, Fuego nachos and the meatloaf sliders.  The meatloaf was a little spicier than I could handle (I'm really sensitive when it comes to hot spices) but the nachos and tacos were awesome.  Three plates and a margarita came to about $26, with the nachos being the best deal. I wouldn't go out of my way to get here but it's a nice spot downtown.

I'd never been until today because I work in west Glendale but I had the day off so I thought I'd take the opportunity. It seems such a popular thing that I figured it would be worth it. Ha!  The parking is weird - it's all paid but not really regulated so I'm sure we weren't the only ones that "didn't notice" the parking signs. It's also basically in a big parking lot so there was very little shade when you're in line or if you're not lucky enough to snag a chair. There was a radio station sitting right in the centre of the trucks loudly playing R&B music which I could definitely have done without. I couldn't hear my mom sitting two feet away from me. The entire space was over-crowded and not very organized. Overall, not the best experience.   A few of the trucks had way longer lines than the others which I thought was weird. Why would you wait in a 30 minute long line for a hot dog when you can just get something else right away? Luncha Libre and Short Leash definitely seemed the most popular, but I went with Emerson Fry Bread (which had NO LINE) because I'm not much for queuing in the hot sun just for food (which I reviewed separately). We were lucky enough to be able to find two chairs but it's not a sure thing. A lot of people went without.   I do not get the food truck craze. It's mostly not worth it. Go to a nice air conditioned restaurant downtown instead that's just as locally sourced. There are plenty of them.

Got a maple butter crêpe with bananas, a cheesecake crêpe with strawberries and chocolate, and the lemon crêpe. When I checked in with Yelp, I also got a free coffee. All the crêpes and the coffee were great - the maple butter one being my favourite and with the most flavour. The prices ($3.50 - $5) were reasonable for the size and ingredients as well.  The only problem I had was with the slow service. The cashier was writing all the orders down by hand really slowly and I stood there while she wrote the last person's order for a couple of minutes without much acknowledgement from her or the many people working behind the counter. The crêpes, something I have experience getting fairly quickly, took a pretty long time. My coffee was brought to my table without creamer or without being asked about cream and there was no cream at the self-serve bar - all of which I found odd. It was a good thing I had no where to be or I would have been pretty upset.   However, the taste of the crêpes outweighs any time inconvenience I experienced this visit. All the crêpes were exceptional and I might try to come back to sample the savoury offerings.

Went here after dinner at Hula's for desert. I'm not a HUGE frozen yoghurt fan (much prefer ice cream, myself) but I'm always willing to try a new froyo place if the price is right. Two people got decent sized portions for under $9. The cake batter flavour is probably the best I've tried of that flavour yoghurt and the caramel was also really good. Wasn't too keen on the cookies n' cream (a bit runny) or the chocolate (a bit too tart), but they weren't bad. A portion of each of the aforementioned with some Ghirardelli vanilla sauce, crunched up Kit Kat, and graham cracker crumbles hit the spot. Not as many topping options as I've seen at some places, but also not lacking. The interior, as mentioned in a lot of the reviews, is a lot more "adult" than most froyo places. It's very austere and somewhat "hipster", but that doesn't effect the product so what does it matter, really? I'd come here again when in the area.

Got the boxty, a jar of coffee (refillable at 10% off), and the day's special lemon tart. The food came out super fast and it was so good. Pancake-sized boxty (2) with shredded apple and a sweet butter on top, paired with two thick-cut slices of bacon.  It's set up where you grab a menu off the wall and go down the line to order at the end. You can see the cooks working without a glass barrier as you stand in line - so don't sneeze.  If you order a jar of coffee at the food counter, the coffee counter further into the restaurant gets a ticket so you pick it up there. It's a plastic-lidded mason jar with a custom label and is filled from jugs in the fridge. It fills about 4 of the ice-filled tumblers/plastic to-go cups and it totally worth the $10. It's super smooth and tasty and not at all bitter. I barely had to put anything into it; I could definitely drink it black and I usually can't with coffee. The boxty was much larger than I expected and the potato vs. sweet apple flavour was distinct from each other and very complimentary, rather than one overpowering the other. The bacon was super tasty too.  The lemon tart was small and plain but still pretty good. I'm not sure what other offerings they have since it said it was the day's "special" offering. They also had cookies on the counter and a little cooler of bottled drinks and orange juice at the check out.  A filling breakfast with amazing coffee for just over $20! I will definitely be back!   PS. All the people writing reviews and complaining about lack of vegan choices - there are other restaurants that cater to your special, self-imposed diet. Never, ever expect people to cater to you. It's such a stupid reason to criticize a public place.

Went on this past Wednesday evening for the first time. They have a small private lot but it was full when I got there at 4pm. There's plenty of street parking around, both paid and free, so you might have to walk a few yards. The beer menu is a giant chalkboard on one wall. They are numbered for easy ordering and seemed a pretty varied selection. I tried the Moa Breakfast from Moa Brewing, New Zealand and a strawberry blonde from The Brewery in Pine, Arizona. Both were good and very fresh tasting. My dad tried three different IPAs and a couple samples of various beers; he liked them all. I'm do not like IPAs at all but they have plenty of hops-free selections. I was a little sad at their lack of ciders - I was hoping for find a place when at least one new cider on tap but they only had one - Woodchuck - which is good but hardly difficult to find (you can buy a 6-pack of their many varieties at most grocery stores).  I also got the Churchill Grilled Cheese and their "home made" "Pop Tarts". The grilled cheese is mozzarella and fontina cheese, honey, house pesto, and I added bacon for an additional $1. The tarts were more akin to "toaster strudels" and were really good - the flavour of the day/week was grape.   The only major problem (which has been mentioned in a few reviews) are the acoustics. When we first arrived, it wasn't bad because it wasn't that busy but by 6pm, it was full and I had to just about yell across our small table to be able to talk to my dad. Not really a place for conversation.   5 beers, 2 meals, and dessert all came to $70 with a nice tip. A little pricier than I like to go for a dinner but alcohol will easily add up. Nevertheless, I would definitely come back for the selection and the food. Definitely a place to try out when looking for a small, local eatery downtown.

Plenty of seating in doors and out with friendly staff. They had a few problems (I didn't see anyone bussing tables and their lemonade machine went on the fritz while I was ordering) but it seems like a really great place. I got the carne asada quesadilla, a steak taco on flour tortilla, and a pollo taco on corn tortillas. These are street food style and came on styrofoam picnic plates wrapped in foil. The tacos were good sized but I thought the quesadilla would be a litte larger - however, there were plenty of ingredients stuffed inside. The meat was delicious! Perfectly seasoned. I also loved that the onions/cabbage was minced so you got a lot more flavour with each bite and it was more uniform, instead of big chunks like some places do. The tortillas were really fresh and grilled. No complaints at all about the food.  I also got a large lemonade "agua frescas". To me, aqua frescas is more like a naturally flavoured slushy where this was just fresh juice, but it was still really good and tart. If you like really sweet lemonade, you might have to add some sugar!   Two tacos, a quesadilla, and a large drink for just over $10. It's street food at sit down prices, but the taste makes it worth it.

Super friendly staff, decent beer selection, really great location with a lot of greenery and it's very open.  I tried the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries, bbq hot wings, and the salted caramel creme puff. The sweet potato fries were perfect - which isn't always the case in restraunts since the sweet potato fad hit - and the hot wings were also very good. The grilled cheese was super tasty and I chose avacado and bacon as my two topping selections along with a base blend of cheeses. The only thing that bummed me out was that the dessert was prepackaged - the server explained that they were running out of them because the supplier discontinued that dessert - but this isn't Applebees, so I expected the desserts to be made fresh! Very disappointing.  They had a lot of turkey-based items (tacos?!) which I found pretty unique.

One of the best burgers I've had in a long time, if ever. I got one with cheese, grilled onions and bacon - it comes standard with pickles and tomato but I went without. The grilled onions were perfectly cooked, it had plenty of cheese with a tasty "Stand sauce" (a type of thousand island sauce), and the bacon was a revelation - something about Niman Ranch? So very good. An order of fries is definitely more than one person should eat. While I prefer thicker cut fries, kudos for keeping the skin on and seasoning them with more than just salt. Also order a side of the Stand sauce with them! There's only ketchup at the tables.  The inside seemed a little weird with how austere it was. Definitely not what I expected. They have an air-cooled patio, though!  I really wanted a shake (they have a lot of tasty-sounding flavours) but seemed a bit pricey at just under $5 for a 20oz. Maybe next time...  Overall, definitely would come back (must try the rib taco!) but remember to share a single order of fries instead of ordering your own and save a little cash for a shake. Very nice local business I hope sticks around!

Ok! Got a $20 for $10 deal on Deal Chicken so I had no excuse not to come back and try the banana shake and rib taco I mentioned in my first review. Ohhhh man, that shake is so good. Real chunks of banana in vanilla ice cream blended with banana syrup - it tastes like the best banana pudding you've ever had, only frozen. I'm a huge fan of banana anything (obviously) so this was a real treat for me.  The short rib taco was street taco style with pickled cabbage, onion, and cilantro with some sauce. It was a little spicier than I expected (but I'm really sensitive when it comes to spiciness!) that was probably from the cojita and cremoso or whatever the meat was basted in. It was really good, though! Good thing I had the milkshake to wash it down with. Got the same burger and fries as last time. Muy delicioso.   What I assume is the owner was in again and is super friendly. He commented on my Star Trek shirt and we had a quick chat about the new film while my food was being prepared.   The only con for me is that it's not near my house or anything I ever go to. I wish it was downtown!

Have also review this place under it's former address just down the street - but have only eaten at this particular location.  Went in for lunch last Tuesday but got breakfast. Still was pretty busy but managed to get a parking spot in their tiny lot behind rather than pay a metre. Inside, we were almost immediately offered the bar area but, after sitting, found the seats are polished steel and I kept sliding off. They are not made for larger customers and some cushions with traction would not go amiss. So, we waited an extra 10 minutes for a table.  Got a large Belgian-style waffle with butter and syrup and the daily special lemonaide (strawberry honey). The lemonade was tasty and the waffle was delicious, but honestly a little costly for the amount of food. I definitely should have gone with the omelette - which is the same price but you get a huge omelette and a side of bacon and home fries! The waffle - which also comes with excellent thick-cut sliced bacon - definitely needs to come with a side of potatoes. A side of potatoes ordered on it's own is over $2.  However, service is super friendly and attentive. Still recommend this place but if you're hungry, skip the waffle and get something more generous!

Amazingly cheap prices, very cute interior, excellent service, and very tasty food. I have nothing to complain about! I got the breakfast burrito with three kinds of cheese, ham, bacon, potatoes (they come with and you can get them in the burrito or on the side) and avacado (an extra $0.79 but worth it) (you get 6 ingredients you choose from a huge list!) for just over $6. The tortilla was fresh and tasty and it was loaded. Also got a blueberry slush lemonaid ($3) and it was obviously fresh and very refreshing. Mom got the "special" chicken fried steak with gravy, with eggs, toast and hash browns for about $8. It's not on the menu so definitely check the special board before ordering - it was DELICIOUS. The only complaint she had was that the hash browns weren't quite crispy enough, but that's such a minor thing. Checked in with Yelp and got a coffee for free, but it was only $1 anyway with free refills. They also had a pretty large brunch/lunch menu which I look forward to trying.  Will definitely be back. I'm pretty impressed, especially with how little everything costs. That's a huge plus for me these days!

Been here twice now and has been a good experience both times. First I tried the carne asada torta with bacon added and a side of fries, yesterday tried the carne asada burrito with a side of guacamole and chips. Their carne is delicious, perfectly seasoned and good quality. The guacamole was great. Their chips are really thick and crunchy with salt but are also great. I would skip the fries and go for the chips, though.   Also got coffee both times and it comes in a little single serve French press you press yourself so you can let it brew as long as you want, which is awesome. I wish there were refills! Decent prices with good service and a nice atmosphere. Recommended.

Great breakfast food. Got the Snooze Spuds (a plate of hashbrowns and cheese with your choice of add-ins) and the daily Banana Fosters pancake on the side. I didn't realize the pancake would be so HUGE! But everything was really good and the service was great. Go with a hearty appetite if you want to try more than one thing.

Brought my dad here for Father's Day lunch. Such an amazing experience!  We started off with a Caprese salad with some of the best mozzarella I've ever had. It came with a few pieces of bread and they bring you a few bottles of different olive oils and balsamic vinegar - all great. I also got an imported blood orange soda that came with the bottle.  We decided to go with the 'meat lovers' style pizza - ham, salami and Italian sausage. It's on a thinner crust cooked in a wood fire brick oven. I love the smokey flavour that adds to it. The sauce was perfect and not too thick and again, amazing quality cheese.  We turned down dessert because we were pretty full but the owner came over to introduce himself and poured us two shots of house-made limoncello and gave us a plate of fried dough with powdered sugar. Both were amazing and it was just so kind! I would definitely order limoncello for myself there again. It was pretty strong but not overwhelming, and I just love lemon and crème. But then when we're just about to leave, he comes over again with two beautiful cherry and chocolate cannoli, saying, "I can't let you leave without trying my famous cannoli!" The cannoli filling was perfect and it was such a generous gesture, it made me feel really welcome. I've never had that happen in a restaurant before and you can tell the owner takes pride in what he does.  The pizza, salad, and soda (more than enough food for two) with a generous tip was under $40. Add in the free desert and it's a hell of a great deal.  The background music was also perfect - Sinatra followed by Mumford & Sons followed by Dean Martin? Yes.  I can't recommend this restaurant enough. I'm so glad it's in downtown Phoenix instead of Scottsdale because I would never have gone!

Got a plate of beignets, a cinnamon macaroon, and a French press coffee. The beignets were delicious and fresh, covered in (extremely messy) powdered sugar. The macaroon, my first macaroon ever, was really odd - I don't get the macaroon trend, to be honest. It was doughy and sticky and didn't have much of a distinct flavour. I expected it to be a lot more airy and light. The coffee would have been better had I put more cream in before I left but it was otherwise all right. I'm not a fan of the roaster they use (I've had the coffee at a few other local places before) so that's more on me. I'll need to come back when it's not so close to closing time so their bakery and food case is a little more full.

I'd been to the other location farther downtown and had been into this building when it was still Rubio's, so I thought I'd pop in and see the differences. While the cashier was super nice and attentive, the food was way overpriced and they seemed to be out of a lot of menu items even though it was early evening on a work day. It's basically still a Rubio's with a different name and didn't seem as homey or "local" as the other location on 7th Ave.  Wasn't impressed and won't be back.

I'm a huge fan of Churn so it was hard to break away and try a new place but I wasn't disappointed! Melt is a very cute ice cream shop a few houses down from (and also owned by) JoBot. They had a lot of flavours I'd never seen before and I was able to try a few before choosing. I love that mom's mint chip ice cream came in a Chinese food carton with a fortune cookie. I got my half blueberry muffin/half birthday cake scoop in a "waffle" cone - it didn't have the waffle pattern and was pretty thick so it's more like a pancake cone - and both the ice cream and cone were delicious. Then, surprise!, there were little marshmallows on the bottom of my cone to, I assume, keep ice cream from sliding out the bottom but was also a nice extra treat. Two scoops with a waffle cone was just under $10. Not bad for homemade and local.

Family staff was very nice and attentive, greeting me as soon as I walked in. All doughnuts are $0.88 despite size or type which is as it should be. I got a blueberry cake, a sourdough, and a regular glazed and all were amazing and fresh. I don't remember having better doughnuts! I also got an iced coffee and it was perfect - I didn't have to add anything to it. Very tasty and not too much crème.  Three doughnuts and a 16oz iced coffee all for under $5. I definitely recommend this place!

Really nice interior with friendly service. We came in late but there was still plenty of baked goods.  Got a medium pumpkin latte and a cranberry scone for just over $5. The latte was pretty good with a lot of spice. The scone was a little dry but had a ton of whole cranberries and was really good. Tried my friend's "pumpkin drizzle" muffin and it was very spicy but went well with the pumpkin spice latte.  They also have a good size frozen yoghurt bar.

I loved the concept of a pie shop when everyone is going the cupcake route these days.  I tried a slice of the vanilla cheesecake with pomegranate sauce and a berry cobbler. Both were fantastic and fresh, and were great with a cup of coffee.  We were the only ones in there and were served by the owner and her partner (?). Very friendly and the place smelled great. It wasn't quite as tea room as I expected though, and is a bit hard to get to on busier days (it shares parking with three super popular local restaurants - Humble Pie, Wy-Knot Cafe and The Main Ingredient). I only wish they weren't $5 a slice! Definitely a rare treat.

I've been a fan of the Cornish Past Co. for years now and love going to their expanded Tempe location. However, I was really excited to see the brand new Scottsdale location. It has a gorgeous outdoor patio and bar and the inside is very spacious with plenty of seating. It's really nice!  Tuesday must be a slower night because hardly anyone was there but my server was very friendly and my pasties were very good. They obviously have recipe and ingredient consistency between the different locations.   I definitely recommend this place to anyone.

Delicious coffee right in the middle of Heritage Square. Probably not the best location for being a frequent customer (not the best parking situation) but is a must if you're visiting the Rosson house, at many festivals held in the square, or visiting the science museum. They roast their own beans in-house and my black coffee was perfectly brewed that I didn't need to add sweeter. They were in-fact roasting right in front of us as we ordered which made the inside a bit smoky but, for a coffee lover, being immersed in roasting smoke was more of a treat. There is plenty of seating inside as well as benches around the square.

Right in Downtown Mesa with plenty of free parking. I got a hot mocha and a freshly baked cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was brought right away to my table warmed up with melted frosting. It was delicious. Unfortunately, after waiting for about 5-10 minutes, I had to remind the barista about my drink. There was a bit of communication breakdown between the two girls behind the counter. However, when I did get my drink (it was made right away after I asked), it was very good. Both large cinnamon roll and a medium mocha were together just over $8. The specials/seasonal drinks were in a weird place - on the front of the counter where you pick up your drinks and on a board on the floor when you walk in, so look for those before ordering - I didn't see them until I had already ordered and sat down and was a little bummed. Look for the creepy mannequin outside when you're coming from the north.

It was a little hard to find for me, and I ended up having to circle the block behind it. It's actually attached to the car wash which is a pretty unique set-up. Going through the drive through, you go right for a wash or left for coffee, though there are signs once you get close enough.  Once I was in the right place, the woman manning the window was super nice and my iced mocha came out quick. As hinted in the name, everything is Hawaiian-themed and they use the Kona roast coffee for all their drinks. It's delicious! One of the better coffee drinks I've gotten in the east valley, no less from a car wash drive-thru. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely come here often - maybe even pick it over Dutch Brothers, a favourite (but not local!) choice.

I really liked the decor of the place; it had a bar atmosphere with super high ceilings and a lot of luchador decorations and murals. It seemed to be either under new management or just a renovation because half of the seating area (with a full sized bar) was closed off haphazardly with booths, and the name on the Yelp listing (how I picked to eat here) and in other reviews is different. Nevertheless, the food and service were both outstanding and I really enjoyed my meal.  I got three street tacos, each a different meat. They let you test them out before hand because they have a LOT of meat options with varying levels of spiciness (as indicated by the pepper graphics on the menu). You build your tacos or burrito with the ingredients you want a la Subway and everything looked fresh and clean. I wish I had tried out the green chili chicken beforehand because it knocked me on my butt. The el pastor and carne asada were amazing though. The asada was probably some of the best I've ever had from a taco joint. I also got a churro which was cooked for me on order so it was hot and fresh.  I definitely recommend this place if you're in the Sunnyslope area.

Amazing Mexican food! I wanted to try something new on my visit to my hometown and this isn't your typical fried Sonoran-style food.  I got three rib eye tacos that were topped with onions, white cheese, and chunks of avocado with a strawberry lemonade. The tacos were really good, fresh, and fairly priced and the lemonade was amazing. I wasn't sure what to do with the large grilled green onion that came as garnish. There were a lot of bakery and frozen items available for dessert but I was too full to try anything. I would definitely frequent this place (especially since it's right next door to a coffee roaster!) if I still lived in town. I'll be craving this place until I visit again!

First off, I've been inside here when it was an IHOP a hundred times. It was a staple of post-Marquee concerts and late night Mill Ave. adventures growing up. It was kind of surreal walking in and having it completely different inside, but I loved the decorations. Very 1960s with bright colours and quirky murals and 8-tracks lining the walls. There's a coffee bar on the left so you can run in for a espresso drink without having to be seated. It seemed pretty empty for a Thursday night prime-ASU location, but maybe finals are over - I'm a bit too old to care about school scheduling these days. First impressions aside, the menu was kind of hard for me to decide on. We almost left because we didn't see anything that really caught our attention. It seemed very Midwestern yet eccentric with things like cheese curds and fried pickles next to bison burgers and kale salad. Not your typical diner fare, which was disappointing as it's just what I wanted. I guess I was hoping for IHOP with a re-brand.  I ended up with the cheddar biscuits with gravy and shared a thing of cheese curds. Having lived in Minnesota for the past two years, I've become somewhat of a cheese curd aficionado and no true Midwesterner would call these authentic curds. They were more fried sharp white cheddar, though that's not necessarily a bad thing flavour-wise. The ranch they came with was really good too. The cheddar biscuits and gravy was also decent, though I didn't like their sausage at all (it came with two links, as well as in the gravy). It had an odd gamey flavour to it, maybe it wasn't pork? I'm not sure as it just says "sausage" on the menu, but I'd suggest a change in provider. I love sausage and I couldn't stand to eat these. The biscuits also had no distinct cheddar flavour, probably drowned out by the gravy. These were more normal biscuts rather than, say, Cheddar Bay style, like I expected. They would have been a lot better with some seasoning and large sharp cheddar chunks, for sure.  I think this place is just trying too hard to be retro-hip. They should focus more on just being a diner that drunk college students would want to come to after a game or concert, not a posh brunch joint for middle class people. Who wants a quinoa and kale with blueberries salad after consuming overpriced cheap beer (or ever, if we'd all just be honest with ourselves)? No one.

I'm pretty sure this used to be another Mexican food place a few years ago, because I definitely had been in there before. However, it was before it was Mucha Lucha with its amazing glittery luchador murals and counter tops. The man and woman who helped me were both very nice and didn't look at me weird when I asked for cabbage in my breakfast burrito. It's set up like a Subway or Chipotle, where you order what you want and they make it for you with the ingrediants you choose. Since it was still early, I got the carne asada breakfast burrito which included egg, beans, cheese, and whatever other fillings and sauces you wanted. it was pretty big and was served wrapped in foil with a handful of chips. I also got a Mexican Coca-Cola. A very filling, delicious breakfast for under $10. I almost didn't finish it!  It seemed to be a favourite spot of local construction teams, so be prepared to share the spot with a crowd of loud, dusty guys. But that's also how you know it's got to be good!

Drove by this place a few times and I can't resist testing out a brand new coffee place. It's inside a historic house but was decorated very modern inside, with obviously hand-made wrought iron fixtures. Tons of natural light and seating inside, would be a great place to get some work done. The owner was working the counter and was very personable, asking us for feedback and letting us know about her business. The inside smelled fantastic as they roast all their own beans there. My large, iced mocha was one of the best. They had a lot of baked items too but I had, unfortunately, just eaten lunch. My mother's hot latte was also really good.  Note: when you're driving, be sure to look for the entry sign to the drive-way, as the parking is behind the house and impossible to get to from the neighborhood street next to it. I had to do a bit of maneuvering to get there as I missed the entrance initially, it's kind of hidden between two of the houses-now-businesses.
