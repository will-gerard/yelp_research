This is the place you come to when you are already drunk and looking to just have some weird wild fun. I came here with my friends after we had been partying for a bit and we were looking to continue our fun. The drinks were strong, the music was blasting, and the people were weird (a man in a care bear unicorn outfit?). I don't think I would eat here but I would come back to drink, dance, and be merry.

You have to be a beer lover to come here and truly appreciate it. This place has so many hard to find, and many times off season beers that other places don't carry. This is a beer drinkers paradise.   What costs this place a start is the noise and the service. Our waitress when we went was a straight up b*tch. She wouldn't come to our table, bring us drinks, and gave us crap about our bill. Not cool.  The noise also killed me. We went with a group of friends and it ended up being you had to talk to the person next to you, and even then you had to shout. I didn't even get a chance to talk to a couple of my friends because the place was too loud.   I'll definitely be back though because they have such an amazing range of beers.

We came here after a night of very heavy drinking, or I should say during. We took to the drive through and got some food to help us out. I ordered some sort of pork burrito and it was shear bliss. I love Mexican food and didn't think anywhere could top Southern CA for its Mexican. I was wrong. This place was even drive through and it was amazing. The flavors were plentiful and delicious. I wanted to go back so bad the next day but sadly it never happened. I know where I'll be going though for my drunk food fixes next time I visit!

When I first saw this place I was little like ummm we are really going in there? But I am so glad we did! Most of the bars were really crowded except for one in the corner where no one was. Me and my friends went over and the super friendly bartender was more then happy to serve us. She gave us some great deals. The first was that she gave me a 2 for 1 on my rum and coke (2 shots for the price of 1). She then offered to give us free shots if we bough a bandanna. (There was some sort of contest and her boss told her she needed to up her numbers.) My friend got a bandanna and we all come some delicious shots.  We then all took a turn riding the bull which was such a blast. Sadly I was too tipsy to be much good, but it was still fun none the less. Even if you sucked the crowd was on your side.  As we were getting ready to leave I had to have a bandanna of my own. I went back to my favorite bartender and she offered up another round of shots for my bandanna. Free shots, fun bandannas, and a mechanical bull. What else do you need?

We came here because my friend loves rooftop bars and our friend suggested we check this place out. I guess rooftop bars in Cali are very different then in AZ because we were very let down. I'll break it down as simply as possible.   Pros: Quiet- Don't have to shout to be heard. Quick service Light up menus- LIGHT UP MENUS! So cool.  Cons: Over priced drinks- Payed like $60 for 3 drinks. Ouch! Even in Cali that would be crazy. "Specialty" drinks- Our waitress assured us this is what they are known for. The drinks had liquors I had never heard of before, so I asked what would be the closest to rum. The suggestion she made sounded great but when it came it was blech in my mouth. It tasted of just straight up ginger. There was no notes of any alcohol, or pleasant flavors. I decided to give it another try and got a drink that claimed to have pineapple, orange, and other flavors I like. When it came it tasted like I was drinking cooking sherry. Where was the pineapple? The oranges? NOTHING! Gross, gross drinks.  cougar/creeper town- When we arrived it was empty. By the time we were going to leave I needed to use the restroom. I had to push my way through a crowd of people at least twice my own age. The dance floor was full of just older people. This place is definitely not the place for the younger crowd.   I will keep away from this place like the plague to save my taste buds and my wallet.
