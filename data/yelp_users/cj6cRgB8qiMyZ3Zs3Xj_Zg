My husband and I branched out to a new restaurant this weekend (Coronado Cafe in Phoenix) - our experience is why we don't like to branch out to new restaurants.  For starters, the host sat us and said "we have a party coming in at 7pm; do you think you will be done by then?"  After that warm welcome we found our water glasses had lipstick on them (both of the glasses).  We ordered the bruschetta (pretty good); my husband had the bacon/cheese burger and I had the meatloaf sandwich.  Burger was good, sandwich was very mediocre.  For the money and the food, we probably wouldn't go back.  The inside of the restaurant was very charming but that is about the extent of what impressed us.

I am a busy working mom that tries to eat healthy as much as I can and I was received a gift certificate for Midwestern Meats.  I ordered their pre-packaged meals from their website and had them delivered today - I just ate the orange roughy, pico and sweet potato for dinner and it was delish!  Super healthy and took me 2 minutes to heat up and eat.  I also ordered their steak, chicken and salmon meals and I can't wait to try them.  It's so nice to have a fresh, "clean eating" meal that is already pre-measured and ready to eat.  Perfect to take to work for lunch.  I am a fan!

My husband and I adore Fez - it is by far our favorite date place.  It's funky but not too loud and the service is always wonderful.  The servers have a good sense of when to check in on you but give you enough space to enjoy the evening.  The food is spectacular - the Fez burger, sweet potato fries, blueberry and strawberry salad and the salmon are all fav's of mine.  My husband gets the lamb every time.  We also love the kizras and the bruschetta is a must have.  The price is just right and it's fun for groups (I have gone there for a girl's night as well and we had a blast!).

If you haven't signed up for the Fez email updates or their Facebook page, you are MISSING OUT.  They are always posting new specials on FB and I have started looking for the emails with the monthly specials.  Last month's curry chicken was outstanding and it was $5!  This month is a turkey burger that looks delicious (I need to make my way over there to try it).  When their prices went up a while back we were bummed (which is why I can't give it a 5), but with these deals we can still visit without putting too much of a pinch in the pocketbook.  If you like the cocktail seen, they have specials on those too!  Still haven't tried the Fez Foodies - maybe today?  I took one of our employees there and got her to try the Fez Burger with Sweet Potato fries; she couldn't stop thanking me!

I have been going for years and have been to all of the locations and I only have the protein pancakes...I have gone with people that got other food and they said it was great so I am taking their word for it, but I am sticking to the PP!  I get 2 and take one home to eat for a later meal.  I wish I knew how many calories were in one but aside from that, I will be a devoted follower!

I have been a client of Scott's Training Systems since March and I have lost 13% body fat!  They have been tremendous in creating customized workouts and eating plans that work for ME.  I am a busy working mom that has to travel for work sometimes and they have created a fitness/eating plan that is totally do-able.  I have other friends that are members and their plans are all different based on their goals - no cookie cutter, one-size-fits-all with these guys.  They are the real deal and it so nice to stop experimenting with all kinds of crazy diet plans and workouts - I just follow what they tell me and get results.

I finally tried Switch for lunch today (after frequenting Fez forever - it was hard to tear myself away!).  WOW WOW WOW!  I am so excited to have a new menu full of fun, flavorful meals to try!  I had the Apricot BBQ chicken sandwich; my friend tried it and almost took it away from me!  Great prices, excellent selection and fun atmosphere.  Tables are a little close together but other than that I can't wait to go back!

This has become on of our family favs!  For the last 2 months, they have had 50% off their entire menu (including sushi) on the weekends which makes it a very affordable night out for the 4 of us.  The sushi is great and we have tried quite a few things there.  The fried rice and main dishes are all quite tasty as well.  I have also taken some clients there for lunch and they came back with their co-workers which all loved it.  The staff is very nice and the restaurant is very clean.  I also like that it isn't as loud as some of the other sushi places around town so you can actually talk.  So why did I give it a 4 and not a 5?  Sometimes they take a long time to check on you or bring the food out.  They are quick to bring the food out at lunchtime (which is good when you need to get back to work) but dinner can take a while.  The booths are kind of strange - the table isn't really the same shape as the booth so you are sitting far from the table (quirky I know, but true nonetheless).  So in a nutshell, Pan-Asia is a great bang for the buck.  The food is good and it is easy on the wallet.  And great for kids - we take our kids there and they love it.

I am a huge fan of Pita Jungle but the Ray & I-10 location just doesn't seem to have their act together.  I have had to send food back several times - cold steak, super salty, there was even a metal piece from a scouring brush in my daughter's food once.  Sometimes the food comes out super fast and fresh, other times its cold and the pita is hard.  So if you are going for PJ, go to Indian School or Ray & Dobson...they are way more consistent.
