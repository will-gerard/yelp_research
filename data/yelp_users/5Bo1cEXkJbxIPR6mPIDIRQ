I live fairly close to this location so it is just too easy to shop here rather than drive 20 minutes to another location -- although sometimes I wish I had when i see the produce or shady peeps hanging out in the parking lot / "cafe area".  The produce is notoriously bad. I don't know how they get away with selling moldy fruits and vegetables.   Bottom line -- you can get away with it for most of your groceries (non-perishables). I would go to another store or to your local farmers market for produce items.

Dude. Why are they such jerks? Total attitude from the time I walked in to paying the bill. I ordered a sandwich and the guy behind the counter gave me some meal deal with half a sandwich. Then when I asked why I only was given 1/2 sandwich the woman at the register said something to the man in a different language, he said something back to her, she rolled her eyes and put out her hand to accept my credit card. I was almost going to tell them where to stick their 1/2 sandwich but i had read good things on here about the food so I took it and left.  Food was meh. Bread was cold and stale. Pastrami was nothing special. Don't bother.

Was not impressed at all. Atmosphere is like a coffee shop. They charge waytoo much for what you get in presentation, taste, and attention to detail. The short rib was alright, nothing special at all. The polenta was too thick and a bit cold.   Wine list is good.  They seem to be trying too hard to be something they are not. Too many restaurants within a 10 mile radius that execute a lot higher for the same price. Will not be back.

A great hospital all around. The educational team has strong affiliations with the Mayo Clinic and the University of Arizona. A great place to train wonderful doctors. Each patient is treated with respect and compassion. The doctors, nurses, and support staff all have a role in making this hospital what it is.

Standard GNC store. Friendly staff. Fully stocked with everything you would expect from a nutrition store.  Join their Gold Card program and save $$. Save extra the first 5 days of each month.

Usually packed with apple fans. They have lots of people working here. Very helpful down to earth staff.   Went in for some dust under my iphone screen. They replaced the phone no questions asked.

Always a quick in / quick out airport. Never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for a security line, most of the time it is less than 5 minute wait. Lots of places to shop and eat, and there are multiple Starbucks.  Free wifi but... I always have a difficult time with the connection. Perhaps to many people are "in the cloud."

Hands down--best sushi I've had in Arizona. The tuna sashimi tempura was amazing. The flavors and textures were simply amazing. Top 5 sushi rolls ever.  The sashimi tasted like the sea and was very tender. We had the toro = also amazing.   Sit at the bar for quick service with the occasional joke from the chef.

This place is seriously good!  Sketchy area at night for sure...but once we got inside they treated us like kings. Sushi and sashimi is super fresh. We tried the live shrinp fresh from the tank.  A must try, especially if you have a car.

Great customer service and prices. The staff were courteous and willing to spend time to speak to me as a person versus just hurrying me along.   Very happy with the service and product.

One of my go-to places when I need to study or write. Wifi is surprisingly fast for the amount of people jammed inside this place on their laptops.   Super cool staff. They accidentally charged me three times and were quick to remedy the situation with some Lux Bux.   Really good chai lattes and fresh baked pastry concoctions. Open til' 10 most nights.

Super surprised by the quality of steak at this place. We had a group of 10 for dinner. The waitress was calm and a damn good sport for taking care of us the way she did. Everyone was happy with their meals. $38 for a bottle of red wine in vegas that was pretty decent?! Major score.

Bouchon is top of our list on every Las Vegas trip. This past weekend was an interesting experience that started out bad and ended up amazing.   In town for a business/pleasure trip and decided to take the fiance and her dad here for dinner as first timers. Was expecting the same five star food and service that I have always experienced at Bouchon BUT that did not happen. Unfortunately our server was not the greatest. He made some rude and derogatory statements to both my fiance and her father. I was shocked and thought he was joking...but he wasn't. Tried to order the steak between medium-rare to medium and it came out well done.  I had the croque madame, they had steak frites. Aside from the well done steak (likely the waiters fault) food was spot on. We sat outside, which was a first for me, and the weather and atmosphere were perfect.   After paying the bill and on our way out the hostess asked if everything was great. I was reluctant but ended up mentioning how rude our server was and that I thought it needed to be addressed. She took down my information for the manager and he called me the next day to apologize. He invited us back for a complementary brunch.  Oh wow... let me tell you they treated us like royalty. Comped the brunch completely. We had mimosas, pastries, yogurt with granola, beignets, chicken and waffles - couldn't do the dessert -- so full.   This place is a real class act. They actually care about their patrons and will go out of their way to make things right.

This is seriously the BEST burger I have ever had (The Delux Burger, cooked medium).   Sweet potato fries are great as well. Open late every night. Also do takeout.

Came here with friends for some Shawarma. Really good and affordable. The three of us each got one plus some other goods from the deli case all for less than $20.  They have a seating area or you can take your food to go. Full market of international groceries which seem very reasonably priced. Lots of hard to find items can be found here.

I heard about this place from yelp and have been coming here since. Super nice people that take good care of your clothes. Prices are reasonable and the turn around time on dry cleaning is super quick (1-2 days depending on what time you drop it off).  They were involved with two episodes of Home Makeover which is pretty awesome.  Closed on Sundays -- also understandable I guess ;)

Went here to pick up my takeout. Restaurant wasn't the cleanest looking inside. The food was meh and it left me and the old lady feeling ill for the rest of the night. Must have been some bad meat or something.   Stay away!

Any place with peanut butter sauce as a topping = the best. Tons of toppings. 8? flavors of yogurt.   The seating can be limited at times.   Price is on the higher range (45 cents and ounce) but there is a frequent customer program that gives you three bucks off after you get eight points.

Nom nom. I have yet to meet a Chipotle that I didn't like. This location is quick, clean, and the people are nice.  Food is standard to all Chipotles.

This place is great! Coffee is amazing. HVL is amazing as everyone else has mentioned in their reviews.   Great place to enjoy a lazy Sunday and read the paper with friends. Also, free wifi so good place to get your study on.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Now accepting  cards via Square!

Great place for coffee and a quiet place to get some work done.  Lots of chairs and recycled tabletops. Not too many outlets though.  The Italian sodas are pretty good as well.

Coffee is great, good place to read or study. Just wish it were open longer at night and on weekends. Perhaps having the Pita Jungle open next door will increase foot traffic and thus demand.   Free wifi.

Yeah it's a bit pricey but I feel the money is well spent on staying healthy. The facilities are phenomenal and that staff knows me by name.  It is really only crowed around 5PM on weeknights. Crowded but you still don't have to wait for cardo machines.  Super clean, new machines, great location, friendly staff.
