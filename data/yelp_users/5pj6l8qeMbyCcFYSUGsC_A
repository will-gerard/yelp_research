Satori has to be one of my favorite sushi places now! The service was absolutely incredible and the food was very well prepared and tasted delicious! Very nice dinning room and a very comfortable place to relax and have a few drinks!!

After waiting 20 minutes they finally tell me they are out of sausage for both my sandwiches. Had to get a different meat. Thanks for ruining my breakfast! Tell people sooner next time so they can just leave! 45 min round trip.

Hand down one of the nicest salons I have been too! Very friendly staff and atmosphere. I had the pleasure of Jessica Zorn cutting my hair and she did an amazing job! First time seeing her and she cut it just the way I like it! Thanks everyone your doing an amazing job :)

I have been working with these guys for over a year now and they have saved me more times than I can remember!  Affiliate marketing is a very specific business and these guys know all about it and how to look at my site and tell me exactly what I can and cannot say.   These guys are worth every penny! In the internet work if you get into trouble you will pay one way or another! I would rather pay them to have my back!

Friday night at 5pm. No cleaning lady and I have been waiting for my bed to get cleaned for 9 minutes now. The girl at the front desk will push lotion on you like a used car salesman while everyone waits to be served. You pay per session. No matter how long you go 5 min or max time, you pay full price. Oh and the best bed I paid for in packages is broke today. *shakes his head* I miss Darque Tan
