Came here with a friend. The guy behind bar was super friendly. Let me taste test the sweet tea vodka before ordering one. Which I ordered one as it was pretty good. Prices are super affordable. The owner was nice too. Can't remember her name. Has short blonde hair. Most the people seem to be regulars. I can appreciate places like this. I only stayed an hour and I can see myself going back. :-)

The worst customer service. I walked in ready to buy a pair of glasses. Had my prescription in my hand. Not 1 person and acknowledged to me. There was only 1 customer in the store. I thought that was super rude. So I walked out. They sell some of the same frames at walmart for way cheaper. Next!!!  A HINT to upper management.....get it together. Most reviews are negative about this company!

I had a good experience when I shipped a large item right before Christmas. The two girls behind the counter were very friendly and helpful. I had my puppy with me, and both girls were dog lovers and were talking about their own dogs at home. I enjoyed them being so personable. Makes sending packages from being an annoyance to being fun. :-)

After going to several places in Chandler (Including crappy Nationwide), I finally got exceptional customer service. The young dark haired girl in the front even let me show her the 4 I liked and help me pick out the right ones for my face! Don't go anywhere else in Chandler.....this place ended my frustration streak with finding glasses. So glad they take took my insurance as well!! :-) Only $38 out of my pocket total! I'm so relieved, I need these for work so bad!

Very disappointed. I didn't get the design I wanted, which was stripes on ring finger. The man doing my nails tried and failed. It looked awful, I had him replace just with glitter to make it simple for him. Same guy did my friends nails a few months ago, it came out bad too. She had to go elsewhere to get fixed. I won't be back.   Only good experience was the lady who did my eyebrows. Very nice and motherly like. I liked that.

I have a Starbucks closer to my house right on Ray and 101. BUT always go to this location on Ray & McClintock. The staff here is great. I especially love the drive thru lady who works Mon to Fri (she isn't there weekends). Being a Starbucks addict, having the same friendly barista is something I prefer. My drink is always made correctly. Which when I walk in and order from someone I don't know, it seems to be a 50/50 on if it is made correct. Only thing I request extra is chocolate drizzle inside cup. Lots of Starbucks mess that part up. So I use drive thru every time now, knowing my drink will come out correct. Service is quick too. Never long lines.

While I do love Bahama Bucks, I don't like this location! The hours they say that they will be open, seems 50/50 if they actually are open. Which seems to be a common problem from other yelpers I see. Well it's still a problem as of today: 4/13/2014!

This is literally the worst mcdonald's I have ever gone to. In the last week I went to separate times to get an iced coffee before work in the morning. Only to be told that their machine is down for cleaning. Just a hint....AZ is hot at 6:30am and choosing to clean your coffee machines at 6 in the morning is ridiculous....... most people drink coffee when???? THE MORNING!!!

Great afterschool program. They pick-up from Conley Elementary. Rates are great!! Staff is excellent. Josh the main afterschool teacher is awesome! Same with front office staff. They are very secure unlike YMCA, Boys and Girls Club, or ICAN program. You need a pictured badge to get through two secured doors. Plus this place is more affordable as well.

Highly impressed! The food is seriously amazing. A lot of Mexican food places are kinda "Americanized Mexican" food. This place is the real deal. My BF had the Carne Asada Torta and I had a bean and cheese burrito covered in red sauce. I usually am picky about meat, so I don't order meat often. Never been a Carne Asada fan. But after trying my BF's, I plan to order one next time. Very delicious. The staff was wonderful and friendly too. I've been a yelper for years, my BF created a Yelp account just so he can review this place. Now he is addicted to yelp like I am.   So if you're reading this review and trying to decide whether to go or not, give it a try.

After going to Power Nissan who told me they couldn't help me. My friend suggested we go to Big Two as he owns a Scion and wanted to try to see if they could help. I got out of my car and was approached by Kelly Grant. She is super friendly and bubbly. Very comfortable to be around. Power Nissan wouldn't even start my paperwork to see what I could possibly get. They just ASSUMED I couldn't be helped. So when Kelly had me to a pre-screen, she went to the lady who runs my info.....within 5 min she came back and said I COULD be helped and wanted to show me a car. I went to look at a Scion XA, which is a small 4 door hatchback that is GREAT on gas. I drove the car on freeway and city streets and loved it! I am very happy with what they showed me. Leaving Power Nissan I felt worthless. Then walking into Big Two I felt respected and treated wonderfully. Other sales people came up and said "Congrats on your new car". Like seriously the process was EASY! I work very hard and shame on Power Nissan for treating me like I'm a loser. Power is way too big. They sell cars and don't care about YOU! Big Two is opposite, they went above and beyond. Kelly Grant is the girl to call! Let me say this "WOMEN KNOW HOW TO GET THINGS DONE". The men there were all awesome as well. They gave my friend and I free lunch. Always offered waters too. I got two stainless steel coffee thermals with lids, keychains, pens, hats, etc in a goodie bag. FUN EXPERIENCE! They are ALL about your comfort! April I think her name is was Kelly's boss who ran paperwork. Jeff is the one who I sat with towards end to fill out the official paperwork. I was very pleased with everyone I came into contact with. This place has a Salon where you can get hair done, nails, and massage while you wait to get your car serviced. REALLY AWESOME PLACE!

Ask for Donald Walker in the Internet Sales department. He is great! Sadly the girl I bought from is no longer with Big Two. So for sure go with Donald Walker. He will take good care of you!

I thought he was really rude. My BF got a DUI. Yes, bad on his part. I went to visit Chuck and gave him $1000 of my money. He was so unfriendly. Wouldn't make eye contact. But my BF wanted to be represented by this guy cause he is huge in motocross. Maybe he is a good lawyer. I don't actually know. But not friendly.

The food is BAD and so DISAPPOINTED! I feel awful to write this. But we all work hard for a living. When we pay to eat out.....we do expect it to taste good.   Orange Chicken - Over cooked and was so stringy. Couldn't enjoy it at all. Sauce didn't taste right either. Very bland. Didn't have that slightly spicy orange sweet flavor.  Egg Fried Rice - NO flavor whatsoever. I added that sweet red sauce to it, which made it taste a lot better.   Crab Puff - I actually think this is the only thing I liked.   Beef and Broccoli - Overcooked and no flavor, per family member who ate it.   Chicken in Garlic Sauce - My BF ordered it. The chicken was cooked well and it tasted good. He wanted spicy, and it was spicy.   Egg Drop Soup - Bland, no flavor. Worse we all have ever had.  Again I feel bad having to write a very negative review. But having to wait an hour and a half for delivery of the food (took 30 min longer than it was supposed too) and costing $35 for the 3 of us to eat. It was a waste of money. I wish we had gone elsewhere.

Now that I come in almost every morning I feel more relaxed and like this is "my starbucks". I miss the Chandler one I went to before moving here to San Tan Valley. But this starbucks is improving with each visit. Staff is friendly. They make my drink correct. Always have a smile and overall just great people. It's clean. You have to go inside if you want quick service. The drive thru is always very packed. But I don't care, I have feet to walk in. I notice San Tan Valley is pretty packed anyway, with lots of homes and not as many starbucks, restaurants, etc as Chandler did. So I can see why it's packed at all the good spots in San Tan Valley.

I love this Starbucks but always such long lines. I feel 20 to 30 min to wait for a coffee is way too long!! Drive thru is always a long wait. Walk inside and think it's shorter. Think again. Another Starbucks needs to be opened in this area. I'll start driving further out to go to the ones in grocery stores. Ridiculous.  Like my previous review. Staff is great!!! Just my quick cup of coffee before work or going somewhere isn't quick anymore and I have to skip going to this Starbucks all together now. I only go if I have time.

It's a shame to go to Sonic and the drive thru is packed, but the individual stalls are empty. What does this tell you?!?! San Tan people don't want to tip the bar hops. The bar hops make less than the drive thru attendants. If you live in San Tan please choose the individual stalls and tip your bar hop. They just want to make a living too. Last time I was here I tipped $4 (which isn't a lot, but more than my normal $1), because the very young girl said she was saving for a car, so she could drive out of San Tan and get a higher paying job. Makes me so sad to see people struggle. Just tip $1 each time. You're helping them earn the money they need to have that shot at advancing into something else. These kids are young and I'm sure live at home. They all seem so nice and like they are working towards something better.   The food is great and service is fast!

I loved this place!! Took 3 kids here for lunch. They offer 3 different salsas with your chips. All are so yummy. I had a burrito covered in their White Spinach sauce and it was amazing!!!! A must try if you live in San Tan Valley.

Really cute hotel! It's decorated really nice. I stayed there in March of 2014. It has a cute bistro where you can order cook to order food. Breakfast is amazing. Prices a little steep. But still tasted great. In a good location near a mall, lots of restaurants, movies, and easy freeway access. I highly recommend staying here.

This place had such amazing food! I am super disappointed they closed down!! I always do take out, never eat at places like this. It is the perfect food to take home and eat with a loved one while watching a movie. Now we go to YC's, which is very good. But not AS good as Genghis was. But I enjoy Mongolian BBQ a lot. One of my fav types of food to eat.

Everyone at Chapman is very friendly and knowledgable. They bent over backwards getting me into a car, since my credit is not great. I had been turned away in past by dealerships for my credit. This place really works with you. My downpayment was much smaller than I anticipated. I highly recommend Chapman if you want to be treated like you matter and not just $$$. If you go onto the website and submit an application they will contact you right away, and get the ball rolling very quickly. My salesman was Donnie W. and his manager Marlo are the best! So many people have bad credit these days, if you don't want to bouce around trying to find a dealership who will work with you (many won't with credit issues), go to Chapman FIRST.

I liked everything about this place. Brady came up to our table and was super friendly. My date loves the HMS radio show he is on. So he was excited to come try it as Brady talked about it on the radio. I live near it and have wanted to try it too. I got the BBQ Burger which was great! My date got the 3 meat meal. He said he enjoyed it very much. The two sides he got were Mac N Cheese and Fried Polenta Cakes.......both were fantastic. We both plan to go back. I wanna try the Red Neck tacos next time!

My boyfriends 6 year old daughter and I decided to get a kids mani/pedi for her and myself a gel mani. We walked in and one lady was waiting for 15 min per sign-in sheet. She got called back. We waited another 20 min and then a mother and her daughter came in. They got called back within 5 min. They may of had an appt, which is fine. But let US know how long the wait would of been at least. We were under impression it was gonna only be a few min wait. I just would have liked clear communication. They were rude and didn't try to explain why the mother and daughter got to go first. We won't be back.

My new fav place to go during my lunch place at work. I always get the Chicken Caeser Pita with Avocado. It's seriously amazing. I wish I could recreate at home. The pitas are thin and is wrapped like a burrito. I like that too, as I don't like too much bread. Price is good too. I highly recommend. It can get busy, but it's in a prim location for college students and Chase Employees. There is like 50 places to eat around here, all get crowded. So plan accordingly.

Finally a nail place, that does a fabulous job! The staff was super friendly. I made an appt, arrived a little early and got called back right away. A nail technician named Jenny did my nails. She was friendly and very focused. She exceeded my expectations, since other nail places haven't done as good of a job. It will cost a bit more. But worth it, if it looks nice! :-)  The manager was nice too. I forget his name. He was funny and very welcoming. He took off my old gel nails for me, to prep me for when Jenny was ready to do my nails. I'll be back!

I love the pita pit location in Tempe were I used to work near. So I was excited to see one open in Queen creek near my home. This location isn't up to what I'm used to yet. But it's on the way. My only gripe was they don't put enough sauce. In Tempe they cover it. I'll just ask for more next time. So my fault. My fav is the chicken Cesar pita with avocado spread. Amazing. My fiancé got the gyro pita and was the best I've ever tried.

Rude! Don't go here. Nail salons are so hit and miss. With most being not good. This is just another nail salon that isn't good. This is a SERVICE field, learn to treat customers very well as they are paying YOU and keeping YOU in business. Don't deal with RUDE entitled employees and go elsewhere. I suggest Pink Polish in Chandler. Beautiful salon and very clean and hip. Best Gel Manicure I've ever had.
