This company was with me every step of the way. I was a first time buyer so I had my fair share of Questions and I couldn't have had more support. They are efficient and quick, they kept me in the loop with every move, they were constantly finding me the best deal. I couldn't say enough great things about them.

I chose to stay at the Hyatt because of the wonderful reviews and the pool looked perfect for a vacation to relax. A week before my stay I looked at my credit card statements and I had been charged twice for a one night stay. I contacted the resort to have it taken care of and the front desj staff weren't helpful in the slightest and managed to hang up on me twice. After leaving two voicemails and speaking to several different people I disputed one of the charges with my bank and it was taken care of. When arriving for my stay I went to check in and they asked me for my credit card again I explained to him my circumstance and he stated there was no record of the payment on his end and that unfortunately I would be charged again. Determined to have a good time and tired of dealing with the hassle of trying to resolve this I let it go and figured I would deal with it at check out. My family in town drove to the hotel to come hang out by the pool( the entire reason we were staying there) when we tried to enter the pool area they stated my family couldn't come in because there was only 4 people allowed by the pool at a time. I went to the front desk, explained that I had already been dealing with one thing after another and asked if they could accommodate me with two extra wristbands for my family who had already driven to the hotel. I spoke with two more staff members that rudely declined I offered to pay for the wristbands and they told me no there were no exceptions. We left the hotel to go to another pool. At check out the next morning I was charged again and there is still a pending fee on my card. So in total I have been charged 4 times and somehow they have no record of the other charges. It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced and a complete and total waste of my money. I have stayed at Hyatts all around the country and always had a pleasant stay but this was a bad enough experience to keep me from ever returning to another Hyatt.

When we pulled up we had doubts but decided to be open minded,To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. The service was beyond horrible. Staff was some of the most unfriendly people I have ever encountered. The food took a unreasonably long time to come out and was under par to say the least. Let's just say that if I was offered a free meal here I would kindly reject. Save your money and time and skip out on cafe wasabi.

Have eaten here numerous times and it is always great. This past time superseded all other expectations the food was phenomenal and the service as well. We sat at the bar for quicker service and Josh and Collin helped us out and they were attentive, and knowledgeable. A+

Impeccable service, food and establishment. Highly recommend when you are splurging on a nice meal. Definitely on the pricey end but well worth it!

Customer service exceeds any other wild flower I have been to. The facility is kept so clean and beautiful. The only complaint I have is the timing on getting your food is always a bit slow. Other then that amazing!
