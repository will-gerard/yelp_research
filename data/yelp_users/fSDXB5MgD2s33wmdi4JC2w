ABSOLUTELY terrible. First I ordered a diet coke that was watered down. Cheap. The garlic cheese bread came back tasting like plastic, and left an after taste where possibly the oven they use gives that taste off.... we immediately told them about it they replaced it with another one (this one was garnished as opposed to the first one) and it tasted the same. Probably store bought.... my fiancee ordered the chicken paramagiana and I ordered spaghetti with meatballs and Italian sausage. His plate came back with this small piece of chicken to the side of his spaghetti. Flavorless and not worth the cost. Mine came back a mess. The meatballs, are definitely either not homemade and store bought or they over cooked it, and left it sitting for a while. When I cut into the meatball it was so hard to cut through, when I tasted it it was cold and again flavorless. A note worthy to the Head Chef: use seasoning on everything or change careers. The spaghetti was hard, not smooth tasting like they should be. The marinara sauce on everything we ordered was bland. It tasted like a can of tomatoes and that's it. No garnishes anywhere. The Italian sausage I was afraid to even bite into. When I did, it was cold and spit it right out. From the moment we got there, our host walked us to our table mentioning how they were "surprisingly busy." I'm sure this may have been the case for the night, and the kitchen dropped the ball because they may have been overwhelmed or understaffed... Either way no excuse to serve what they served. I went and nicely told our server it was not her, we were actually pleased with her, but for our first time, it was horrible and we wouldn't return. Adam the manager then came out told us his apologies, went back to the kitchen, and found out they did overcook and let the food sit, so apparently from Adam's words he said they were afraid of being in trouble, which now they were all "in trouble." Any ways, they only got a 2 star only because Adam and the server were nice and they ended up comping the entire bill except for $2 for the iced tea my fiancee ordered (which also sucked). We tipped her $10. Although he tried getting us to come back. I will never. First impressions are everything and YUCK. I would have preferred Burger King food over this place. Nothing amazing about Olive Garden but we should have gone to Bucca Di Beppo or Olive Garden. We ended up not even eating, paid for our bill, and left to go eat an actual tasteful dinner elsewhere.

There restaurant is very cutesy but not in a good location as it is hidden. It's a small, family owned restaurant. The owner is French himself, VERY polite, and very accommodating. Was even offering us to call him for advice if we ever decided to go to France to help us and let us know where to go as it would be easier. The pesto chicken sandwich was good as well. My boyfriend had a sandwich in crepes - which also was shockingly good. They have a multitude of variety for their sandwiches but still light feeling. They give you a good deal of a portion size. They are quick as well. They have a bakery for some pastries - which I want to go back to and take a look at. All their water is bottled too, not tap. I would highly recommend their crepe sandwiches and chicken pesto Panini.

I gave this a four star only because I love Dr. Williams as a person. She is very friendly, personable, and sympathetic. She comes from the same nationality as me so we had a great commonality. Dr. Williams has been our family physician to my grandparents, mother, father, both my sisters, and myself for 12 years (since 2001). She has the same medical assistants which is nice, because everyone will remember you. They don't ask for my last name or any information as they remember who I am when I'm scheduling appointments. During the summer they do not have Saturday appointments, however when the school year starts they do which is very convenient for me since I work a lot. There wait times are not long at all. I love Dr. Williams and Dr. Smith. Both physicians ask how you and your family are doing. Including are really sensitive and have great bed-side manner. They are very thorough physicians. Dr. Williams will order every lab known to mankind but does it because she wants to get to the problem. Dr. Smith will listen to your problems and really try to figure it out as well but doesn't overwhelm you either. Today I went on lunch, from 11:30 and was out by noon: that included checking in, copay, getting pulled to the back, seen by the MA, and then the physician, then get my referral out to an Endocrinologist and out the door. They are pretty fast and efficient. The only thing I don't like is that with all our blood work and lab results they call you back in even if it's one lab result that is abnormal when they could easily say it over the phone but that's not their fault that's a HIPAA procedure. So you can't really blame them. All in all, they are great and very smart with great bed-side manner.

I got Invisalign from here and had it for a very short period of time. Although I didn't have it for a long period, Dr. Schwartz also threw in Zoom Whitening, and made my gum line symmetrical to that of each specific tooth for aesthetic purposes. He made my smile very nice. Even to this day, years later, it's the first thing people notice and continuously comment on. I'm so happy I sought him out as a dentist, and couldn't have chosen any Cosmetic & General Dentist better than him. He also has easy road access to his dental facility from the 101 and Pima/90th St. Great atmosphere, great customer service, and the office is a sterile, cleanly, and luxurious environment. He does a great job! Very happy with my results. I highly recommend him.

Love this place. They have great sandwiches, and great service. They even deliver to you without an additional charge at whatever cost you are spending. They are a family runned business. Definitely a HOT mom and pop shop for the real "lunch bag" feel. Great concept put into realization.

Very friendly owners (family owned), very small place, great food! Try the beef Mongolian and creamcheese rangoons. They are amaze balls. Place is hidden, location could be better. But if you have a problem with that then Gary opened another location off 90th St. and Via Linda in Scottsdale.

Love this place. They are reasonably priced. They work off a point system as opposed to other tanning salons where they would do it by purchasing a certain bed level for an allotted time. Pro Tan USA has great lotions, beds, and service as well. Very clean environment -always necessary! All in all, great spot.

So being an avid Yelper, I had reviewed them exactly 1yr and 2 months ago giving them 5 stars. However, this company is good to you if you are not a loyal customer. In becoming a loyal customer I purchased an unlimited membership month to month contract with an enrollment charge. After considering the monthly cost and accruing that charge month over month I decided it was not a beneficial bill for me. I ended up calling them in June 2013 to cancel my membership in which I was informed the process would have to be an in person cancelation including a hefty cancelation fee. With that being said, and to much of my annoyance, I proceeded to cancel my membership in person at an additional charge including the next months membership charge (note to self: I'm not renting an apartment to have to abide by similar policies). Subsequently after noticing continuing $43.95 monthly charges (when not utilizing their service for over 9 months) for the next 6 months I contacted my bank to place a stop payment due to the fact they are no longer an authorized merchant. I was then advised by my bank to dispute my claim to the owner, in which I did. Thereafter, to my dismay, the owner, Jim, called back a month later. The owner then continued to state, he "deals with a lot of people like myself who lie, if this was L.A. Fitness they would laugh at me," and continued to state, "he's a small business owner who does not give customers their money back" after openly admitting he noticed I have not used their service for those 9 months... Nevertheless, based off our conversation, he expects customers to save receipts over a yr ago whereas the company has no recollection or tracking system in place for cancelations. (I wonder why). This is his mechanism in not reimbursing customers close to $300 back (his words not mine). I then told him they had no authority to continue charging as that's fraudulent activity. I asked him his full name and he avoided my question twice then hung up. I called back to his direct line immediately after, no answer. I called back again, no answer. He's now avoiding my calls.   Overall he was very rude, and mentioned he was "shaking in his boots" when I told him I'd contact the BBB, review him on Yelp, and take this to a small claims court. Needless to say, I'm accepting his challenge and taking this much further.   Similarly after reviewing other yelp reviews, I noticed a filtered review from Lauren H. who in fact was extremely accurate. He claims customer service before he lashes out at you when the company is at fault, and avoids you at all costs. Sad stuff but reality. I used to like them, was very loyal to them, but not anymore. Never again.

Regis Salon will give you a very personable and exceptional experience. Everyone will remember you and will always serve to give you the best hair cut, style, and color. They also wax eyebrows, and actually listen to you. You say not too thin, they won't do it thin. You say only cut a trim, they only cut a trim. I'm picky with my hair, and only trust a few people, everyone here I can trust although I do personally love Giti here.

It started off rocky here for us as well... Similar to Kayla's comment... But it started out rocky doesn't mean anything because it stayed rocky! My initial yelp review was extremely positive who knows - maybe it's because I didn't have to deal with them that much for 6 months.... Well, long story short: My fiancé Nick and I have requested maintenance tickets every month almost regarding piping and leaks etc in more than one area: with no resolution.... Then one night a pipe/hose broke behind the washer. One of the maintenance tickets we had requested along with the guest bathroom toilet and sink. Which all leaked.... We kept getting responses like, "tightened" or "cannot find source of water...." Really?!?! Well it got to the point where my entire town home unit flooded!!!! And ruined all my wood furniture, upholstery, ceilings, walls, light fixtures, shoes, clothes - I'm talking everything!!!!!! In looking at filtered reviews, I realized I should have read through them because I'm experiencing the same problems! They threw my clothes in the bathroom and my expensive jacket, Louis Vuitton purse, tori burch shoes, Burberry scarf, etc. on the way floor- closed the bathroom door and let it sit there for 2 weeks now! It smells last nasty mold all over!!! It took them 6 days to start venting the place properly. Even no it's still wet everywhere! I had to try and contact the manager for about a week and everytime you ask for corporate they give u the operators name! They very well screen all their calls when u have an issue! The repairs are still not completed, and I'm going to take further action if things aren't fixed. I came last night to check our home out and they missed areas of walls that was ruined... Today I come to check - they painted over it! Like that's really fixing the issue?!?! They didn't replace the carpets either. In addition they left my unit a mess, dust, debris, ceiling particles all over the place, my furniture ruined....everything. At this point according to the Arizona law they have a certain amount of days to comply and they failed on that part, they failed on meeting our accommodations upon moving in, our place wasn't cleaned and the carpets werent replaced! They even have documentation of severe allergies I have and what's going on town only makes me go right back to severe allergic reaction mode.... This is material noncompliance and negligent behavior. Not too mention they never provide updates, what's been fixed, what hasnt, whether Mold inspector came out or not, or even simply when they were in and out of my unit. They even told me it's not typical protocol to move a tenant into a different unit - I wasn't even trying to break the lease or anything. Now I'm requesting my rent back, them to pay the water and APS bill, and reimbursement for all personal damages despite the lease language as it was their negligence that led to this... I'll keep you Yelpers posted.   Oh fyi you can hear everything through the walls. Every argument, laugh, talk, bAthroom use, and when your neighbors have sex! Awkward!  Update: flood number 2 in a matter of 18 days! C'mon guys! Clearly they didn't fix the problem!!!!

If your searching for coffee and don't want the typical Starbucks, then you've found your new home.   They actually cater parties as well. There food is decent. They have a wide selection from desserts to actual meals. They catered my birthday party, and were very accommodating to me and my time. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food, and were quite impressed it was from Coffee Plantation! Nice work guys. Not only do they have great service, but it is a place for memories, studying, and seeing familiar faces. It's a definite go-to coffee shop.

Love Nahren and Nino, they are the nicest owners. They were offering to help people out of the place with babies, always asking if we need anything but also not over-bearing. Everything we ate their was amazing, and flavorful. They ambiance could be better. It's small, and in a L-shaped plaza, but because the food was amazeballs, I could careless. They also sold us bandeleros tickets to casino Arizona and for gypsy kings. Love them. Try everything here. The restaurant is NOT greek. I hate when people say it is. It's ignorance. It's TRUE AUTHENTIC ASSYRIAN FOOD! ASSYRIAN FOOD. That's all. Thanks.

My go-to ice-cream shop in old-town scottsdale would definitely have to be G-spot. All the staff are very friendly, especially Kristin! Kristin has the best customer service I have seen in the longest time, in any business. She makes it a point to talk to every one of her customers, get to know them, and you actually get to know her. She's not just another server. She is quick on her feet, gets every order right, and makes it a great experience to study, eat, chat, snack, drink coffee anything there!   Gelato has a wide variety and selection of ice-cream, with all of your favorites in one place: coffee, pizza, ice-cream, beer, home made sangria, real shaved chocolate for your coffee, sandwiches, etc.   It's trendy, and is a great get-to-know-your-date spot! Awesome atmosphere.  Not enough parking, but that's nothing compared everything else! It's a great spot.

We found this place on Yelp searching for a great local breakfast joint. We wanted something different than your classic "Dennys" or extremely packed 2 hour wait breakfast spot...so this was perfect. Our server...I forget her name but she was ripped! had some great suggestions for us. I ended up getting the Raisin bread french toast (which was fantastic!) and my friends enjoyed a couple of skillets. Good food, good times! Also lots of TV's around so you can catch the game while eating which was definitely a plus for my boyfriend haha  We'll be going back for sure now that we found this spot. Thanks Yelp!

We went to The Mission to celebrate some news that my boyfriend had, and it was an EXCELLENT choice might I add (on both the news, and the restaurant). Due to us arriving a little later in the night, just before closing, the service was still prompt with great suggestions....  As we both have never been to the The Mission, we entrusted him to select multiple items for us, and each dish came out perfectly, and savory.  The service was excellent with great customer service and quality. The ambiance was gorgeous and classy. I loved the layout, as well as the dimming of lights, architecture, and design of the environment.   It's a great date place to go. Very romantic and classy. Although it is classy, you do not have to dress up. You can still go very much in casual nice attire.   Great recommendation!

Just signed up here...Classic gym but close to home. So I don't mind. There's a good variety of classes, spinning, and a basketball court for all those actives out there. Ya it's pretty busy, but any gym is between 5-8pm. If you go after 7pm you'll have ample amount of space.   Great place to get your sweat on, just make sure you see Curtis if you want to get signed up this year. He's a chill guy and no pressure at all. Thanks Curtis!

Thomas is abso-tudi-lutely hilarious. He accomodates to your honey's schedule, and will surprise them anywhere; whether it is at their workplace or at a house party. He is very funny, and makes you feel comfortable during his singing telegram. Not only does he sing telegrams to individuals, but he also does comedy roasts. He's truly a great find!

It was busy even during the week at lunch. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch during the work week. We had a very nice waitress who helped us. No wait time. It's kind of like another breakfast club, but smaller. It would be good for a breakfast and lunch type day. They do serve breakfast all day they have great items on the menu as well as lunch. They have a really good chicken avocado sandwich that's not high in calories at all. It was savory. I actually do want to go back for breakfast one time. The only thing I did not like, is that they had almost TOO many items on the menu. It was probably because I didn't know what I wanted and it overwhelmed me in regards to where to even start and what to narrow it down too. I could have probably chosen a good 5 things off the menu that I would have ate right there. All in all it was good. Would be fun for a Saturday morning or Sunday morning brunch. For two people it was I think $26-29? Pretty good.

Location is hidden and terrible. The las vegas roll was flavorless. Normally I get spicy tuna and im glad I didn't even try it. The potstickers weren't even that great. Yikes. I thought it would be a nice sushi place. But after a basketball game, you think it would have been packed. There were only two customers in the entire place. Ending up taking our food to go. I had literally about two bites and then ended up giving our left overs to a homeless guy.

This place used to be called Cave & Ives, which is very missed!!!! The gentleman who owned it previously did however make a wise choice to sell it to another gentleman who knows restaurant biz as well. The Attic is a very delicious burger joint. They have the world's famous burgers and were appointed as one of the top burger joints in the United States. Which to my liking, they were excellent. You have to definitely try this place if you are a burger girl like me!

Same as my tip but more- They love me here more than I love them. Lol- here weekly because of work. They are truly amaze balls. Especially Chris Hoye the branch manager. All of them said I'm their favorite executive client. Honored much?! Oh wait, probably because I make it fun for them! #funnygirl #couldbeacomedian according to them! Truthfully they are busy but they make it fun and their customer service is on point. I deal with the branch manager a lot as well as 5 more of their employees (forget names sorry buddies) but they all are young professionals truly trying to make it out in the world. Excellent customer service, they pick up and drop off, they are always busy but you never have to wait long, they are all driven (hah no pun intended), and strive to provide great service! #loveenterprise #lovemesomechrishoyeinmylife #love5otherguyswhohelpmeandentertainmeweeklyyouarenotforgotteneventhoughiforgotyournames

I really like the ambiance and decor in this restaurant. They had very good service, and their food was great. The guacamole was excellent, chips you can taste are home made which were good too. I had a carne asada torta. The portion was big, but it was perfect. We also ordered the sweet corn which was amazing! Definitely have to try it. They also have brunch until 3PM and happy hour after 3 PM. Great tequila selection and full bar.

Tonight was amaze balls.  It started out with 1 glass of wine, which turned into 4 sloppy ones. Mr. Music Man hugged me, told me he loved me, signed my CD, and committed to having my babies. Meanwhile, I'm selling my best friend, Stephanie to Mr. Space Heater Waiter Manager Mike Man. He was so sweet. She was freezing, so he brought her a blanket, and a space heater in which we thought was a fan until we felt heat. He was very attentive to us, needless to say, and kept filling our drinks till we felt it. I then convinced Stephanie to have a "wet t-shirt concert," multiple times, which I meant "contest" (drunk girl can't speak problems). Did I tell you, I really loved the Mr. Music Baby Maker Music Man #dreamy. Our Manager Mike Man knows how to use hashtags. I then convinced Stephanie to roll up the blanket and put it in our purse, which he loved, because clearly I'm a comedian, and I kept making people laugh like Randy Johnson, and the 3 Coyotes Hockey retirees tonight (p.s. you can have my babies too). No joke. By the end of the night, we ended up in the parking lot convincing them to make us mac and cheese while I was talking to my two eses in spanish.   #hashtag. Tonight was legit. The Living Room is legit. Mike was too legit to quit. Mr Music Man - he was on a whole other level (or lover your choice). Very romantic, casual, trendy, chandlier - sia type song, wine, brick walls, and living room.   This is our new spot! Faux sho.  P.P.S. No one was hurt in the making of this review. I'm feelin' the wine tonight. Clearly. Needless to stay Stephanie got a number out of tonight, and I got a boyfriend...?
