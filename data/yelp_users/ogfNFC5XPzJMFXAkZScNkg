Downtown Glenedale, who knew?! An adorable cottage houses the best Vietnamese restaurant in North Phoenix, if not all of Phoenix! Family owned and run, you feel more and more like part of the family with each visit. They have a foundation of loyal customers built on word of mouth.  An extensive menu of usual  Vietnamese dishes. and though they have fab pho, my favorite dish is the barbecued fish (off the menu)- hand delivered on a steaming platter by Dad himself! One of these is enough for 2. Wash it down with a '33' beer and take a leisurely stroll through downtown Glendale.

A Friday afternoon of lounging in the beer garden at Haus Murphy's definitely tops my list of favorite things to do. Start with a glass of Weizen, a tall one, then cruise through their extensive menu of Bavarian specialties.   Schnitzel or brats with a side of kraut , black forest ham sandwich, oriental chicken salad(?!), perhaps a strudel for dessert. I opted for the Reuben sandwich on my last visit. Though quite tasty, the corned beef was sliced a bit too thick for my taste- the deli down the street has them beat hands down. Stick with the sausage.

Ugh! If I could give these bastards negative stars, I would. This is the second time we've ordered from Amazon and had packages delivered by On Trac. We have an Amazon Prime account which guarantees 2-day deliveries. These bastards always claim to have attempted delivery at the end of the day on the 2nd day, which is FALSE. Therefore our packages arrive 3 or 4 days later.   In this case, our package was scheduled for delivery on Friday. Friday, no package. We tracked the package Saturday morning to see that they "attempted" delivery. And now they won't attempt to deliver it again until the next business day- Monday. So in this case, that 2-day delivery will be more like 5 days.  There will be one very disappointed 2 year old birthday boy tomorrow. Actually, he probably won't even notice- but I will. :(
