I love this place, it's one of my favorite Diner Drive In and Dives, and I enjoy stopping anytime I get a chance and am going through the Phoenix area.  The restaurant area has expanded, and it looked cleaner and nicer than ever.  They are doing well.  I normally order the triple taco place with rice and beans, and it never fails to amaze me - the flavors in the meats are cooked in just perfectly.  I had a combo this time of chicken, carne asada, and carnitas - all excellent with the absolute right amount of spice.  Perfectly flavored rice, and just the right amount of cheese in the beans.  There were no tables outside like there have been in the past, and we had our dog with us, so they had no problem letting us taking a table outside, and we put it back when we were done!!  This is the perfect along the freeway fast and delicious stand-by!

We've passed by this place so many times, I can't believe we've never stopped!  It's so cute and country inside, I felt so welcomed and at home here.  As soon as we walked in the door, we were greeted by the friendliest people, and such a nice waitress - she put her hand on my shoulder and invited me to come back - I just felt so welcomed and at home here!  This is the best service we've had in a restaurant in a long time.  I felt like I was back home in Pennsylvania.  The food was good too!  It was Friday and all you can eat fried fish , french fries were perfect, my husbands burger was perfect, we loved how they bring the iced tea with a carafe so you never run out.  The pies looked amazing - that's what they're known for , but we were too full to try - maybe we'll have to stop back on the way home from Sedona!!

I was going to be in Scottsdale today, and just happen to see an episode of triple D on DeFalcos, I went and I wasn't disappointed!  A real Italian deli.  It reminded me of Roma Imports in Tucson.  I took a calzone home with veggies and pepperoni.  The combination of mozzarella and ricotta cheese was unbelievable!  So stringy, and had the right combo of oils on it.  The pepperoni was the thin real Italian kind - all AMAZING.  They had a cute little market with good wine, and I found some canned clams that are hard for me to find.  I also bought some imported Italian pizza sauce for my next homemade pizza. The calzone took about 15 minutes, but the wait was worth it!

I picked up a to go bagel sandwich before work this morning.  It was so fresh and delicious!!  It had sliced tomato, egg, and a fresh bagel.  The eggs had such a light and healthy flavor, and this was the freshest bagel I've ever had. It came with hash browns on the side, and a glass of orange juice that tasted freshly squeezed.  I would like to go and have a sit down breakfast here, and try some of the great variety of dishes that are on the menu.

I stopped here after a hike based on the good reviews it received.  I was very disappointed.  The salsa was thick , almost mucousy.  I got food to go, and I waited for 30 minutes for chicken tacos.  The girl kept telling me it was coming right up, but it never did.  I got the food home, and it was terrible!  There was a mango salsa, and the mangos were overripe and chalky.  The chicken was just shoved in the tortilla all in one piece, and the tortillas were very thick and flavorless - just store bought.  They also forgot to include any utensils.  The patio was cute.  I would never go back.  It's not my idea of Mexican food.

I was in Scottsdale for work, and stopped here for dinner on the recommendation of a coworker.  A great recommendation it was!  I sat at the bar, and had excellent , fast, and friendly service.  I had the sea bass, and the honey lemonade, The sea bass fell apart in my mouth, it was flaky and the vegetables were perfect in flavoring and cooking consistency.  I savored every bite, and wished for a bigger glass of the lemonade.  The environment was cozy and clean and fresh.  I ate  my food as I just finished a hike, and was hungry.  I wanted more, but it was perfect, and I didn't really need more.  I think I'm going here every time I'm in Scottsdale now.

I had the PB and J burger with sriracha and bacon - GREAT!!!!  I have to go back now to try the sweet potato fries!  The bacon was high quality and cooked just right!!  I wish I could have had a beer with this, but had to hit the road back to Tucson.  The burger was cooked just right, and it the oozing pb and j ran onto my fries for dipping.  It had the perfect combo of sweet and spice.  Good service, nice ambiance - I kinda felt like I was on vacation on the beach - a nice desert oasis.  I want to go back and try more of the burgers - there are so many to choose from!

I met a friend here after work yesterday, and I was so thrilled that she recommended it.  It was right up my alley!  A big bike hanging inside, and a dog and bike friendly patio!!  Loved the vibe here - the final four basketball was playing.  I had an orange blossom beer - quite yummy - it was the perfect spring beer, and from a brewery in Scottsdale, and the chicken mac, which I had no problem eating every bit of , even though it was huge!  Perfect creamy texture, and taste with just the right amount of chicken chunks. I also tried the salted caramel cake which a tiny bit dry, but good!

I stopped for breakfast because it was next to my hotel when I was in Scottsdale for work.  I got a good vibe as soon as I walked in.  It was homey, but modern, clean and fresh looking.  I ordered from the healthy section of the menu - a brie and green apple omelet!  I also ordered an almond coffee - unfortunately they were out of the almond, so I got a caramel macchiato.  The omelet came with a fruit shish kabob on the side.  The omelet was fluffy and big and yummy - I thought the brie would be worked into , but it was a big slab of it on the top!!  Perfect - better for the tasting!  A couple of mistakes by the staff - I ordered coffee in a to go cup, and it came in a ceramic cup, then they brought a hot to go cup, I finally asked for a cold cup with a straw, and the waiter said sorry - he couldn't find the right cup before!  They weren't even that busy!  But overall a very enjoyable experience. I also had enough food to have breakfast for the next day!
