Ra is a tradition for us. When I get to "go home" to the valley there always seems to be a girls' night out. Great service and great food, all the time. Try their coconut creme brulee if you're in the mood for something sweet. You won't be disappointed! Prices are best at happy hour- of course.

I have heard so many fantastic things about Julio's Too, so I was really excited to try it today. I was so disappointed though!! I ordered the lunch special K which was a tasteless green corn tamale with rice and beans. The tamales was flat out horribly bland, even the melted cheese on top was bland. I ordered a fish taco since I didn't like the original plate ordered... what a waste!!! It was just a (not-battered) fried fish filet on corn tortillas with cabbage.   Pros: best corn tortillas I have ever had... I ate them plain. They serve Pepsi and the tortilla chips and salsa bar was good... But that's it!   I will never go back, except to maybe buy corn tortillas to take home and make my own tacos.

We went out to Bucca on Monday night. While the food was decent the service was horrible.   First we started out with a male server that seemed to find waiting on us as a burden. Then a female server took over who had no idea about service. OUr drinks sat empty, nobody asked us how the food was and the check literally took over 10 minutes to arrive- even after asking for it.   I'm not sure I'd ever go back.

I've been eating at Ned's Krazy Sub since I was knee high to a grass hopper. I even worked for Ned when I was in high school.   After all these years I know what I'm getting cause the food and quality is still the same, and at fantastic prices too!   I loved it as a kid, now my kids love it too.

"How have I lived without their green sauce all my life?"  This place is just around the corner so we stop in every now and again. Rudy - the owner is super friendly as are the rest of his staff, his family.   My favorite is a bean and cheese burrito that I dump their green sauce into. BUT their tacos and tamales are delicious too. I haven't really had anything I didn't like.   If you're in the area stop in and try it!

Updated review.... I have moved to Texas since I wrote my first review on Rudy's Burritos. My son says we should live here so we can eat at Rudy's every day. (he really means EVERY DAY!) Or we should win the lottery and pay Rudy to move to where we live now. He could live on Rudy's bean & cheese burrito. Rudy is so nice. The customer service is awesome, always has been.I have had several items on their menu, from bean and cheese burritos to chorizo and eggs, to the yummy delcious california burro to tamales that melt in your mouth to.... YUM! Their street tacos are devine... Their tortillas are chewey yummy goodness. I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area and like Mexican food. If you don't like Mexican food, you may stil like it, cause it's that damn good!!!

I can't wait to go back!!  Everything we had was so yummy!!   I went to the Olive Mill on a Friday early in the afternoon with my mom, aunt and cousin. It was all so delicious. Our favorite thing was the butternut squash soup.   The counter staff could have been a little more helpful but they weren't rude.

So I'm sitting in my house in Oklahoma, wishing I was in Mesa so I could go get a baby strawberry-colada with cream. It just sounds so, so good right now. I miss Bahama Bucks. It was a fun treat while I was growing up and then turned into a fun treat for my kids. We would go in almost once a week, and every time I'm home, I home visiting, BB is a place I must go.  The couply that owns this particular franchise is fantastic. They get to know their regulars and definitely are great people.

This review is only on delivery and customer service.   I live in Oklahoma, though I grew up in the valley, and grew up on Barro's Pizza. My kids are in AZ visiting grandma for the summer, and I wanted to surprise them and order pizza for them after a long day at the pool. I called Barro's and explained what I wanted to do. The girl that helped me was super friendly and said it was no problem. I told her how much I wanted to add for gratuity and that all I wanted was for someone to be able to sign for the order. She said "no problem" and even asked if I wanted to include a message. She was great.   The pizza arrived within 40 minutes and my kids were super surprised and called to tell me how delicious it was. They got my message and said the driver was really nice and told my daughter all she had to do was sign the credit card slip.   The order couldn't have gone any smoother. I am so happy that my favorite pizza place could help me treat my kids! They were so great!

I am so so so glad that I am no longer in the care of this Family Practice office. Each time I would go in for an appointment they were running hours, I'm talking 2+ hours behind. Once I was late less than 10 minutes and they threw a fit.  Now that I live out of state, all I'm trying to do is get a copy of my records. It seems to be rocket science to them. On hold for over 20 minutes with an intermitten "thanks for holding how can I you?" from different people. This is INSANE!    When I finally get somone on the phone I'm asked if I need all my records. I said yes. So they tell me since I need my whole medical record, it cost $10 to get my records on a CD. I went there twice. I can't imagine my records being more than a couple pages. I asked if for the $10 I can get my son's on the same CD. Nope. We were both there a total of 4 times - combined. This place is so completely disorganized and the front office staff is completely aloof to the patient's needs.   If I moved back to Mesa and this was the last medical office on earth, I would go die  in the gutter. I wish I could take the one star I had to give them, to write the review, back. They don't even deserve that!

While "home" for the holidays I was really craving pho. I grabbed my daughter to set out and find some. Armed with our iPhones and Yelp app we found Simi's Cafe. I've only ever had pho at 1 other restaurant so I don't have a ton to compare it to, but it was great. The ingredients were fresh and the price was perfect. My daughter ordered the orange peel chicken and said that it was the best she has ever had. It was only $4.99 on the lunch special menu. The staff was friendly and attentive. When I'm home, I'll be going back to try more dishes. Loved it!

I'm so glad I chose Best All Around Roofing for my roof repair! Ron, the owner was so thorough in explaining what was needed, the cost, and the process. Every time I called the company I was greeted with professionalism and friendliness. My roof estimate was exactly what was charged. I'd do business with this company over and over.
