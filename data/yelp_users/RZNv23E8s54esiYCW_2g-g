Took my car for oil change and alignment.  Made an appt so got my car there on Wed.  However they did not fix the alignment at all and it was still obviously off.  My boyfriend took my car there twice after and they kept saying they were busy.  Ok fine finally made an appt on Saturday.  Called me exactly at 4 pm that day and told me SORRY he forgot they close at 4.  So I didn't have a car the whole weekend and had to get a ride Monday morning to work.  Seriously just coz i already paid they were being a jerk about fixing it again.  We all know we NEED CAR in Arizona.  What kind of company would call exactly at closing time knowing i can't go pick it up immediately.  Would not go back again they can't even fix alignment something so simple.
