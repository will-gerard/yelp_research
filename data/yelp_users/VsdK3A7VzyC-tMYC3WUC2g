I had initially gone in to the store for a microphone for a friend's camera. I called first to see if they had the types of microphones that were required, and they said that they did.  So I drove down there and ended up buying a microphone however due to the distance on the microphone that I needed it didn't work as planned however the store took it back without question. No hassle and still were very helpful so I'm very happy with them.

I have to say that I am totally amped that this bed bath and beyond has a world market in it. I asked the girl at the front if it was actually THE world market inside and she said that it was the only one in the state and probably would be the only one. So I basically went here to return a toaster that I bought back in August that just crapped out on me.  So I returned it picked out another one and that was that no questions asked.

I love KFC. Anyone who left stars less than 4 has to lower their expectations. It's KFC!! Pot pie was awesome. It more expensive than most fast food but still good once in awhile. This review is shorter than most but then again so am I. Lol

This is now the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought from Finish Line. Not sure why I never reviewed them before. They deserve 5 stars.  Eric is the manager I have always dealt with. He knows what he is talking about and makes it an easy transaction. No obnoxious up sells or anything.  Highly recommend.

So as you can tell by the time I am doing the review,  it's 10 to 9 on a Saturday night. We came here, walked in, and there was a restaurant full of people.  The front lady barely even looked up and a busboy came over and in his whiny little voice said "it's 10 to 9" as if to let her know that it was going to be too much of a hassle to seat us because he had somewhere else to be.   She said we're closing in 10 minutes under her breath and indicated that he would be faster if we did take out. So I asked her do you not want us to eat here and she said no it's okay we can see you, and then she said but take out was faster. So I said don't worry about it we'll leave so you can close. The end.

What a hidden gem. I really love this place because  1. it doesn't always seem so busy.  2. because the staff is really cool and three you don't have to pay a membership fee like you do at Costco or Sam's Club. This place has all restaurant grade items bulk items everything you can look for in one of those places and more and the items are very very inexpensive.  3. Never a line.  I wish there were more around but this is close enough to where I live so I'm happy.

There is one reason, that sticks out like a sore thumb why I have them 5 stars.  THEY HAVE MARGARITA BRAND PEPPERONI!!! Seriously this is like the only place in town I could find it. When I walked in and saw "Boars Head" brand I was really irritated that an Italian specialty grocery store would sell Safeway grade deli meats. But then I asked and they had it. So amp'ed.

Straight up I just love this place. This has the best kosher section of any grocery store in the area that I've seen so it makes it very convenient to go shopping. I also went around town to find horseradish root which nobody had but this place does the produce section has to be twice the size as any other. They even have their signature section where you can buy mixing bowls and all kinds a home goods so the place just rocks it is never failed me yet.

This place is very convenient when you're trying to deal with your drivers license and registration services. They do Vin inspections which is what I went therefore and that's to make sure that your car is in stone or anything apparently. But the one thing that makes him stand out is that I had gone there for copies of that report because I kept losing him and they could've charged me $15 every time and they didn't they were very cool and I never had to wait.  So they get five stars. Who would think a registration center would get five stars LOL?

Beware of this place. I stopped in to look at a chair to buy and they say that they have a price match guarantee and they said it's even if it's online "even Amazon". So I went online I check the chair I found it for $20 cheaper on Amazon but they told me immediately that it wasn't valid without even looking at it because it was by an Amazon reseller and it actually had to be by Amazon itself which is total BS.  I went on to the website for Staples and I read their price match guarantee fully and nowhere in the terms and conditions does it say anything about that at all. All it says is a shifty, they can change the rules anytime. In the end because I'm a true yelper even though I got it for the amount of money that I said it should've gotten it for they still need only get one star the lady at the cashier was a total bitch and the manager was inept at best. Also on the poster in the store there was no asterisk or indicating "fine print".

So I got a email yesterday or actually a couple of days ago from discount tire because I've had worked on there before and it was letting me know that I needed to get my tires rotated. The first part that's really cool is the fact that the appointments were very very easy to make online it took all of two seconds and then I took my car in. When I got there they check the tread and I knew this was coming so wasn't really unexpected but they said that I needed for new tires I verify the measurements just to make sure because I saw there is another reviewing her that was bad and wanted to make sure there is nothing crazy going on.now I know how to repair shops and tire places can be with how long it is to wait so I asked them what was the slowest time of the day to make an appointment and they told me around 1 o'clock so I said how long will it take and they said about 45 minutes. So I get there today at 1 o'clock and I am literally out at 1:44.they even had the car pulled up door up and ready to go so it was a very good experience.  Dictated by Siri. Please disregard any errors.

Gotta say, I'm pretty happy with this place. Very spacious. Affordable. Nice location. The girls in the office take care of business and maintenance is always there when you need them. Just put a request in.  When I moved in they has just remodeled my place.  I'm on the third floor, that's a lot of exercise but hey.  It's fine.

I'm not usually one to comment on airlines only because every time you go on a trip each flight leg can be totally a different experience. However I think it's worth mentioning that this last time that I flew to Cleveland that this flight was no short of unbelievable. Starting from the very beginning of getting into the terminal I got through security so fast and to the gate I couldn't believe it and I also had no issues getting on the plane the plane taking off the people that were on the plane as far as the attendance were very courteous they were not obnoxious telling stupid jokes as normally expected.  It was just an all-around great trip very accommodating so as always I'll keep flying Southwest not to mention my bags don't get charged

This place routinely has the absolute worst service.  The first time my 2 kids and I went there, it took like 45 mins to get served.  THIS IS A MALL PEOPLE! Now tonight, my kids have forgot the pain from the last time, but they said they wanted to eat there again. I overpaid for the kids tenders. While they were waiting for their food, I went to another restaurant and got my food.  I came back to the table where my kids were still waiting. I ate my whole dinner (slowly), while they were STILL waiting. So now as I have nothing to do while waiting for them to finish eating dinner, I'm writing this review. Smh...

This is very rare that a place like cox can get a 5 star rating. Here is why.   I went to cox bc the makeshift internet provider in my apt community was horrendous. I have reviewed them in my portfolio of reviews. If you live where I do cox is the only choice.   I ordered services online.  VERY VERY EASY.  I then got a call from a csr to verify the installation. I was going to do a self install. They told me the router Would be with the guy who hooks up the cable on the outside. So I got it, hooked it up and was up and running in minutes. The download tests were really high. Totally stoked.   The router started to act up and my beliefs started to go away about how great they were. I called them and they said they can send another router out to me. It could be damaged. I told them I don't have that kind of time. So they said I could pick it up from the store.   I went to the store and it was already provisioned and ready to go. As I was waiting I had gotten a csr call from the acct start up team and told them what was going on. They apologized and said they would check back in to make sure everything went fine. So I got the new router went home and it worked fine.   Yeah, there were a few issues but they took care of business.   The internet access NEVER goes down, and better yet, my speed got doubled for free starting this month.   So I am very happy.

I haven't been to this place in about seven years. I decided to take my girlfriend for her birthday. And I always like the entrance to the kitchen. I think it's really cool and really old-school and I like that they have an updated it in a long time or at least made it seem like it hasn't been updated in a long time. I ordered the prime rib and I ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail. They were probably the fresh shrimp cocktail I've had in years the prime rib was perfectly cooked the owes you was great and the horseradish was extra hot which is how I love it. The bread that came out was unbelievable as well and I can't believe I ate as much as I did we finished off with my girlfriend getting the Apple cobbler and I got the cheesecake. I love that the desserts are so homemade. Don't let down is that that they used to have the desserts on a tray that they bring out and then you just check it off of it but apparently that's gone. Anyway Ricardo is been there for about 19 years was a great waiter make good suggestions and looking forward to not saying away for seven years this time.  I use this with Siri so if something looks really messed up blame Siri

It started off pretty good. Greeted, check out was easily. Place seemed pretty chill which is what I read on other reviews.  Lots of plugs, nice, music not too obtrusive.  The reason why they got 2 stars? Very simple. The internet is slower than dial up. I did multiple speed tests and it took forever for anything to load. Of course the douche bag customer that doesn't seem to respect other people needs to put tweety bird on silent before I straight up throw the damn phone in the garbage. I have provided a picture of the speed test. No excuse for speed this slow. Especially when I pay 2 dollars for a water.

I have been here a few times and every time I come here I love the place. They have by far the most tender barbecue and great portions. I've never had a problem getting seating and the service is always been really good. Of course the hot donut holes on the way out our fantastic but I can only eat here on my dieting cheat days but it is definitely on the list of places to eat when I want to eat this kind of food. I really like the ambience as well. Another thing that's good is that the price points are where they should be so yours able to take big groups and family and their stuff for the family my kid is really picky and I like chicken fingers and he liked what they had  If there's any errors in this post it was done through Siri

Updated Review - After my review I was contacted by the hospitality group at LGO. The heard what I had to say and acknowledged the important of reviews and making sure their customers are happy. I am taking them from 2 stars to 5 for multiple reasons.  1.They contacted me within 45 mins. 2.They treated my review as important as it was their first.  3.They described what course of action was going to be taken. 4.They asked if I would please come back in and not let 1 bad experience ruin a long relationship.  They did everything they could do to correct a an issue and shouldn't be penalized.   Thank you LGO for taking care of business.   First Review (Below)  I have been here multiple times before but this time really bothered me. The music was loud which wasn't a huge deal but the fact that the pizza guy kept throwing the empty pizza trays on to the floor in an extremely loud, startling manner made dinner unbearable.  Every minute you would hear a crashing of empty tray on empty tray.  Very disappointed.  I used to eat here almost daily. I will come back again and hope it's a one off but it was by far one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant.

You have got to be kidding me. Seriously. I get an event invite on my Yelp app for the Christmas at the Princess. Just to make I wasn't reading it wrong, I decided to go with my gf to see if it was true and it was.  Let me say that since the Princess is a resort, you can't simply walk there so here comes my first issue. The parking is 30 dollars!!!! 40 for valet! Then if you do decide to look at lights, something you can do ANYWHERE.  Glendale, Phoenix Zoo, even Kierland if you're really lazy, it doesn't cost money; everything else costs money. 15 per person for ice skating plus 5 for rentals so it's really 20 per person.  So before you really do anything, JUST for a couple to go, it's 70 dollars.  ROFLMAO! Apparently there are a lot of people doing a lot better in this world than me.  Could you imagine if I drank? No thank you.  Good luck Princess.

Wow is all I can say. We had to move one of our plane tickets because my girlfriend had to have emergency surgery.  They wouldn't move the ticket and said they don't have a health clause. They said she should have bought insurance. This is by far the worst airline ever.  What they don't realize is their main offices are in Tempe and we live in Scottsdale. I will be getting a refund in person. NEVER USE THIS AIRLINE.

I don't like Mexican food as a general rule. I don't like beans. I don't like sour cream or guac.  It's all gross. But I was pleasantly surprised when  my gf and I went here.  It was close and had a Yelp deal so we tried it out. We've actually been there twice. The food was great. I had a braised pork dish.  The place wasn't packed which I liked. Pretty chill please. You can have a conversation.  Dessert was awesome. The cookie dough taquitos or whatever they were.  I didn't give 5 stars because I wasn't blown away.  But my expectations were exceeded.  I will def go back

If you see my tip, it says "seems a but pricey".  But to be honest, worth every penny.  They did a fantastic job for my sons Bar Mitzvah. The dj was great. The Emcee crushed it and kept everyone dancing all night. Never a full moment. Never had to wonder when the party was going to die down.  Was executed with perfection. Thank you for a great time.

I cannot believe that they actually charge money to cash a check that is written on their own paper. If you ever want to acquire more customers from other banks or have me open one just to make life easier, charging me isn't the way to do it. You would think that the largest bank in the world would reserve this behavior for the check cashing stores they back. Staff tells me " well, we can do the transaction and at the end it will tell us". Yeah, I'm gonna waste my time while you decide of you want to charge me. Yeah the manager was nice. But another bad factor is they are in a grocery store that opens at what 6:30? Why would they wait til 9 to open.  Chase across the parking lot which is stand alone is open at 830!

Didn't realize this was right down the street from my house. Food is pretty good and priced appropriately.  There is a ton of Tvs to watch football so I take my kids on Sunday.    Reason for not having 5 stars:   1. Trying to tell me that I couldn't drink my Monster drink from outside.  Use judgement. I am coming in with 2 kids on a Sunday.  Do you really think I'm curbing your alcohol sales? 2. Fly in the restaurant constantly circling my food. I understand the door opens frequently but still.    In summary, I will be back.

I was previously a member here and left bc I moved across the st from Lifetime. Since then I was at LA Fitness and now back here. For 9.95 a month, no enrollment, use of every Golds except downtown, and open 24 hrs, it just can't be beat.  Another VERY important piece, they have FREE WIFI.  Now you would think this is a given, but Lifetimes has NEVER worked, and LA just didn't have it. The costs of the extra gig of data I don't have to buy now, just paid for my membership. Yeah, there are some meat heads, but I'd take that over the Scottsdale Social hour any day of the week. Why not 5 stars? Bathroom cleanliness.  No excuse. I never was one for showering at the gym anyway. But at least they could clean the toilets.    Updated Review-  After numerous posts, reminders, requests, I'm canceling. I can't even check in on here the wifi is so bad or should I say non-existent.  People that run it are more interested in talking about what happened at the club last night to turn around and ask me what I needed.   "Hey wifi isn't working." "Which one did you choose" "The only unlocked golds gym hotspot moron".   Still isn't fixed.   Bathrooms still not clean.  Rather jog outside that pay 10 a month and get frustrated everyday.

I love this place. I have been going here since I was a kid back in Ohio.  Everything is good on the menu. I wish they could come up with a way to keep the waffle fries warm longer. :-) People are always nice there who serve you. ALWAYS. It's most weird.  But nonetheless appreciated.  Which it was open on Sundays, but that's the Southern Baptist culture, and again, respected. Glad they are popping up everywhere.

Been eating here for years but after a long time waiting, it's time to review. Food may be good, but if you are in this area asking this kind of money, you should offer Wifi. Yes, they insist they have it under "CafeWifi" but it never connects. Until this is fixed they won't get anymore than a 1 star. No business meetings can be held, I can't do work while waiting for my food.

I can finally go ahead and give this place five stars because they have Wi-Fi. Long waits don't matter when you have Wi-Fi. your guests that are with you that bother you don't bother you anymore when you have Wi-Fi. life is just better when you have Wi-Fi. The food is good and came out fresh the waiter took care of business.  moderately priced so I'm happy  Disregard any spelling errors or weird text as I use Siri to do my reviews.

I've been here a number of times and I have to say I have never had a bad meal here. They have a great happy hour. The volcano chicken is great and a little secret is the ask to mix the chicken with teriyaki. it comes in sirhacha. Its great.  Its not too loud, the price point is right, and the best part for me is there is cooked food as well as sushi. I initially didn't want to eat here because I don't eat Sushi. I came for my friends. The cooked menu is great. Anyway, hope this was helpful.

This needs to be posted on every APS Yelp page until they consolidate al of them.   APS is absolutely deplorable. They have a complete monopoly on Phoenix.  Consumers don't have a choice for power service provider and because APS knows this, they charge like old mob racket. I have had service with them, again, no choice, and one day I get a letter stating that I have a security deposit required. I had service at this new address for 5 months before this came to so I called. They told me because I was past the due date that they can at their discretion ask for one. EVEN AFTER SERVICE HAS BEEN CONNECTED.  I obviously have no choice in the matter. I asked them what past due meant. They told me after 13 days!!! My mortgage allows 30 days. The credit bureau reporting system is based on 30 days. The whole world works off 30 days. Past due after 15. Very crafty how the bill is due JUST before most people would pay their bills from their paycheck on the 15th.   They charge me 1.5 times my bill for the last 12 months. Now remember, I have only been there for 5 months so rather than judge it on MY last bills which are low, I have to be averaged off of another family. So the deposit was massive.  So I tell them (based on principal) that I cannot afford to pay it. So they say they will separate it into 2 payments (how generous). So I make the first payment of 80. Mind you, this is NOT for services rendered.  Next month I get my bill in the mail, and like every month, I pay it.    Few days later my power gets shut off.  I think its a building fuse or from a storm, but as I am walking to the maint office, I see the yellow tag on my meter.   So I call APS and say WTF?? They tell me I was shut off for non payment. I quickly log on to my bank and see it was paid and I tell them this. They say, " no, it was for security deposit". I asked them what do I owe on my service. They said nothing. I said, so I got disconnected over an arbitrary deposit when my bill is paid in full? They said yes.   They then tell me there is a reconnection fee and if I want it done that day there is 100 rush fee.  Now, this is all happening in the morning. I went to the gym and came home within the hour. So you know the service guy was within a mile.   I talked to the "manager" and he was " nice enough to cut me a break" and not charge a reconnection fee. So I waited until the next day so I wouldn't have to pay the rush fee, and avoid reconnection. So because it was a cool 115 that day, I had to sleep at my gf's, WITH MY 2 KIDS!!!!  The next day all of my food was bad and still cost me over 100 for no reason.    APS needs to be stopped and there needs to be regulation.

I'm gonna go on a limb here first start off by saying the other reviews, while opinion, are silly. IT'S A GAS STATION! Lower your expectations. Anyway, I don't like gas prices, but I'm clearly not going to hold that against Danny's. Haha. But, I did my oil changed twice which is a rate able service and both times they were acceptable. They didn't pull the hard upsell and tell me my car was going to explode if I didn't change every filter known to man kind. They merely made suggestions. I respect that. I took it and dropped it off, went to Golds to work out and walked over.  It was all done, oil change, car wash, done. Were there minor blemishes? Sure, but I just kindly asked them to give me a towel. If I had paid 100 for a detail, then I would be more judgmental. It's hard to give 5 stars. I'll let that get earned if they stay consistent. Good job Danny's.

After careful consideration of wanting to not have to do a review I feel that I need to do this. I hope that the managers of the store make the appropriate changes. I came in to sit down because I scheduled a meet up. As I sit down there were numerous tables that were unbused and there is a sign on the door that said they were closing early today for a meeting. When you have people that are going to have a meet up at your place and assume that you are open, either change your hours online or have a meeting after closing hours.  Then as the busser came by and cleaned up the table I thought that was excellent that he actually got paper towels to dry off the white table so I can put my laptop down. However what seals the deal on two stars is that the music is so obnoxious and so loud that I can't even hear myself think which makes this a terrible place to have a meeting. Also be aware of your demographic. Understand that people that are coming to your store are not the people that are listening to music from the 1950s literally.  Severely annoyed. For the record, I waited three visits to of terrible music to write this review.  Extra bonus. PISS POOR WIFI. Remembering that fact just brought you back to one star.

Not much to really write. They are consistent. My kids love eating there. I love the chicken crispers. The waitress there remembers us and our orders, which is funny considering most waiters at restaurants can't even get an order right. I love the self check out on the tables, so i never have to ask for the check. Glad that technology is coming to phx finally. They also have games to keep the kids busy. Never have had bad service. Sorry but there isn't anything bad to write about this place.

I cannot believe that after this long companies still do not have Wi-Fi in public places especially when their clients are spending more than five minutes at their place. I went to go try out this gym because golds gym Wi-Fi was terrible if operable at all. Checked in here, met with the manager and asked if they had Wi-Fi and they said no not yet but it's coming. Seriously? So I left.  How does one justify charging money for a membership that doesn't have wifi.

I am truly disappointed by the Apple Store. I have 2 iPhone 6's, a 6+, iPad Air, iPad 2 and other numerous accessories for this store. When I bought the phones I also bought protective cases, Apple brand. One could assume that if they're the ones that made the phones then they would be able to make the cases that they could scan behind. So my Son and his up dropping his phone and it fell flat on the glass part that was supposedly protected by the Apple protective case. Apple also boasts the superstrong glass cover on the iPhone six..now because it fell flat the cover should have protected it but it didn't and they will not replace the glass on the phone. Not even as a courtesy after all of the other products that I bought from there. The insurance on the phone to fix it is actually more than it is to just buy the glass and fix it. So the fact that they are going to try to squeeze another $170 out of me after spending nearly $600 on the phone just a few months ago is absolutely ridiculous. This actually makes me want to trade all of my Apple products and and never buy another one and matter how easy or intuitive they may be. If this is how they treat their customers after they spent thousands of dollars with them they don't really care.

28 mins to get served at lunchtime is unacceptable. That's great that they have soup available but maybe that should have been a red flag. The excuse that they make everything fresh doesn't work for me because it doesn't take 28 mins to make a chicken souvlaki platter. Lunch started off good but didn't end well. Please remove the word "Express" from your signage.

This was by far the easiest buying process I have ever had.  Danny Eastman the Sales Manager and Steven Broka went beyond expectation.  I got a great car at a fantastic price; in fact, I flew in to pick it up from Phoenix.  The car was there waiting for me in excellent condition. The paperwork was done when I arrived. Steven even picked me up from the airport. I couldn't have expected or imagined a car buying experience like this. Kudos and plenty of gratitude to Danny, Steve, and Desert Bmw.

I went into Ganem yesterday to look at some watches. I have a thing with jewelry stores because they tend to be really snobby. But within a few seconds of entering I was greeted, and asked if I needed any help. I told them I was just looking around for a watch.  I don't like to be followed around the store like a thug either.  Once I found what I liked they took the watch out of the case and let me try it on. I liked the watch. I was only in for a few minutes bc I had stopped at the bank next door (convenient) :-).  Anyway, I went back in today and decided to buy it. They treated me with respect, they were courteous and laid back. I have been to other jewelers that weren't so nice. So, I can say when I decide to buy more jewelry in the future, this is where I will come.   One other point that played a part was that I found out it was a local family business. I would rather support them than a corporate chain at the mall.    Only bad part, I don't have a credit card that has miles other wise I probably could have had a free airline ticket to San Diego. :-)

This is the second time I have been here. Both times were painless. I wasn't anticipating the cost bc I thought my insurance covered all of it. Anyway, the root canal I got done by Dr. Engelberg took just about an hour. 1 trip needed only. Dr. Markson did my root canal last time. I will of course go back if needed. This is not the kind of place you want to brag about being the Duke of. :-)

Not sure the guys name but I went to this pharmacy.  I was given a prescription from my dr. The prescription ended up costing a ton if money. The pharmacist showed me how to go to the website if the medicine and register so I basically get it free for a year. For that alone this CVS gets 5 stars. Not to mention,  Ali is very friendly every time I walk in. Even if I'm in a pissed off mood.

I came into the store because my sons shoes have holes in the bottom of them and he hadn't told me. So I went in and I talk to the manager and he help me out very much. He knew where the holes in the shoes came from as he is a skateboarder himself. He properly fitted both my sons for new Paris of shoes so they wouldn't wear the way that they did before and he was very knowledgeable and nobody was talking about. They had a good selection and the prices were not astronomical the shoes were between 45 and $70 a pair so I am a happy person.

My kids took me there for fathers day. the food was good. consistent. I have been there a few other times. They gave me a beer glass for fathers day, with their logo. that was a nice touch. A lot of TV's. A little louder than I prefer but good over all. food came out nice. waitress was attentive. 4 stars for being a fan. Takes a lot to get 5 stars from me. I would go there a again.

I gave 4 stars because giving stars to a govt agency just seems weird. I guess if they had a few more people, that would help. But its the govt. Low expectations.  However, I don't have a problem here and it does move relatively fast, except for when some moron stops in and waits in line to ask directions. Clearly not the post offices fault. Employee are friendly. so they get 4 stars. good job.

Worst place ever.  Even with an expedited signature tracked package they can't deliver on time. Package has been sitting at the post office since Friday(3 days ago). Yet no one can seem to tell where it is.  If it were their pension check, they sure would know where to get it.  They have told me 3 times they would call me.  Supervisor just hides behind the desk and won't come out   No wonder overnights are so popular.

Consistant food. Priced right. I rarely order anything different than the Steak salad bc it's so good.  Fries are great too.

This is the best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale. By far. Food was great. A lot of food to choose from. Price matched value. The Bruschetta was awesome.  The mussels were really fresh. Holy cow were the garlic knots awesome. The meatballs were fantastic. Cleat you can see I didn't even have to order an entree. But that just means we have to go back for more.  If I had to pick a negative - the lighting was a bit dark. But no reason to take a star away for that.

Had the roasted chicken. It was juicy, and the whole plate, spinach, onions, and polenta(don't even know what that is but fantastic).  Some items from tks. Which I love. Not too loud, good lighting. I need to see my food. Timing was FAST.  In at 6:58, food out by 7:05. Not kidding. Def coming back.

This place absolutely rocks. Even with all the volume that they do they always seem to give good service and the food is just kick ass. When I come here I normally get the Italian sausage on a hot dog bun but some hot peppers it is the only real Italian sausage in the city. I also recently gotten the hot beef sandwich because that too is just killer with The hot peppers. Can't forget to get some french fries with it as well. I'm glad it is a bunch of locations everywhere and it's also good that they're open till 11 o'clock at night. the end

It's a pretty good gym. All the equipment is new nothing is broken. I didn't give it 5 stars becauseI don't like that there's no paper towels anywhere to wipe your hands are sweaty. Also that the only drinking fountain in the back of the gym. But it's conveniently located the staff is cool. it's not expensive. One thing that really bothers me though is the music that they play but most gyms have terrible pop music anyway it's just really hard to block out because it's kind allowed and it's the same songs over and over and over and over and over again. If I have to look at Megan traynor or Taylor Swift for watch their music video one more time during my cardio I'm going to kill myself.  But I recommend it.

I gotta get back on here and give 5 stars. After my review I was contacted by the manager and was told that the wipes that are all over the gym are actually "natural" based wipes and are safe to use as towels.   That's why there are no paper towels. He also changed the music to something more tolerable. So it's good to know they listen. Thank you!

Just as I figured this would happen. I read all of the reviews but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I cancelled my membership that I was told was "Month to Month". Not even getting into it. They keep charging my credit card after numerous attempts for them to stop. Cancelled it and they got their extra month due to lame billing cycle game gyms play. Keep getting blown off. 1 star is staying. Don't bother trying to call to smooth it over. I'm not changing it.

Went to the mall because that was the only place I thought to go to get a broken iPad fixed. I checked Yelp and this place had good reviews so I called. They were cheaper and said it would take 1.5 to fix. I left the mall and drove over.  When I checked in I go a coupon for more money off. I left and went across the street to pick up something. The whole process from checking in til picking it up was about 50 mins.  This place is highly recommended.

This is a pretty good place to go eat. It's very convenient because it's basically across the street from where I live. They have a good happy hour menu both early and late so that makes for good snacking. The amount of food you get for the money provides value so I'll leave here. That is a very big sticking point for me. One of the reasons I did not get five stars is because it is very loud in there and I honestly think some sound panels would work.

Brand new C63 AMG. Over the first 12 months, car was in the shop for over 45 days. Mercedes takes no responsibility and does not stand by their products at all.    They play the lease game and not being accountable for their actions by saying the car is leased by Mercedes and that's who I have to take it up with. However Mercedes says that I didn't buy it from them so they don't have any responsibility.   They had to replace the ENTIRE engine. An AMG is touted as "1 man, 1 engine". To replace the whole engine takes away the custom nature of the car. Probably the best part about the whole situation is that on the last time that they were fixing my car they actually DROPPED A CAR ON MY CAR  and caused $5000 worth of damage and they want to say that fixing it is enough. My car one time had to be picked up and towed back from being in the middle of the desert.  You would think that after spending $75,000 on a car they would do something about it. Shady. I'll never buy one of those Nazi Sleds again.

I eat at BW-3 quite a bit since I have been eating there since I was 18 in Ohio.  I do like the company as a whole. food is good. A bit more pricey than I would like, but I go anyway. The reason they didn't get 5 stars is because after going there at lease 1 time a week since opening, the food doesn't always come out hot. Some of the wait staff are either really good or really bad. The inconsistency is what is the issue and with a few changes they can be stellar. The place is always clean. Bathrooms for the volume are in good shape. But its the front line people. The kitchen can have the food up and they are busy talking on the floor.  They have a good happy hour and a lot of good specials during the week. The TV's are awesome. But they have to agree on a volume. If i am going to the restaurant, I don't want to have to fight over the volume. this has only happened a few times.  Bottomline, I love B-dubbs and want them to succeed. I will continue to go there, and you should too. Just a few minor adjustments.

Restaurants should be rewarded for taking care of business and having good employees.  I arrived 10 mins before lunch hr was over but had to go to the cox store. I walked in an Tamara the host helped me. I asked if I could order my lunch so I can get the lunch special but run to cox quick. I hate missing the lunch special. She honored my order. I came back an the food came out 5 mins later. Kudos. Thank you Tamara!

Serious new low. They need to change management.  Where to start.  Maybe I'll just list:  1. The new manager Steve doesn't accept the free snack size coupons because they are for 7 days only. This is from the free wings for a year promo I won.  So it's actually free wings for a year as long as  you go every week. Yes they are dated.  But not only do other managers honor them, but OTHER LOCATIONS honor them. I tell the waitress, "I have a whole stack of them in my car.  Does it really matter?"  2. Waaaaay too loud.  I know what a sports bar is.  The decibels were off the charts.   3. The free wings I got were not only cold, but actually seemed chilled. They were below room temperature AND hard as rocks.   4. Food took FOREVER to come out.   5. When asking the waitress for extra sauce bc for one, they didn't make my cold, hard, wings wet; it took 15 minutes to get the sauce. Then she wanted to charge 60 cents even though I had declined sauce for my sons tenders.    I think that enough for now. I've wasted enough energy on this tonight.

****Updated Review- It is my duty as in elite member of yelp to keep up with reviews and to make sure that my reviews are current as well. As I've had bad service here in the past which you can read below, I have visited here multiple times since that event and feel it's time to give them back the five stars that were once taken away. The blonde Manager( I don't know what her name is but ) she has done an exceptional job in making sure that people are happy. I have watched from afar what the staff does not just judging on my own personal experience.  I don't want the result of one bad night manager to get in the way of a whole chains reputation. It's just not fair.  So for that reason thank you for taking care of business and getting back your five stars.

Came here. Waited 15 mins for a server to come over.  Get our drink order and as he lays down the glasses he says "Just want to let you know we are out of traditional wings for 30 mins".  OMG you gotta be kidding me. That's like In-N-Out running out of hamburgers.

So happy they opened a new Barros across the street from my place. My kids love the food. They have good daily lunch specials. Any time the order has been wrong, which is very few and far between, they have always been really cool about it.  But again, few and far between. Maybe 2 times since 2004

I have been going to this target optical for a couple of years now. Every time I go there I never have an issue and they always have good prices on their glasses. They are aware of what insurance covers you and what insurance doesn't and they also give you their honest opinion when asking what looks best as far as glasses.so I would recommend him and I just bought two pairs of glasses and will be going back again next year. I also might add that it's very convenient when they post their hours for appointments so a lot of times you can just walk in and get an Eye Exam.   If there are any errors in this post it's because I used Siri.

I'm going to start off with this review by saying sorry that I have to go against popular demand but this is what yelp is all about.  We went and checked in there just after 10 o'clock to get something to eat. We are driving by and saw four peaks and a few other's and we're looking on yelp for places that were open to eat late and figured this is a eatery and distillery so that means to me it's a bar with food so we decided to go in. The first problem that I have is as you're walking in it smells like sewer and I don't know why it's there but if I was an owner I would definitely be doing something about it. The next issue was that as soon as I walk in it's a dog patio and I know there's a lot of dogs here and they want to be accommodating to people with their dogs however I am just not one to mix animals and food. We then sit down and I'm  given menus and are told that this is the late-night our menu and there had been no more than six items of which three weren't even real dishes it's basically pretzels hummus and burgers so for a bar that doesn't leave very much food at all to order. The only place that I see late menus is places like Pita jungle and even then they have a much bigger menu then this bar for a late night menu. So in conclusion not my place, wouldn't go back.

I had to actually create the business profile on here their service has been so bad. I moved into Vintage at Scottsdale. That is the address I used because New Media doesn't post ANY information online.  The community uses this company. The internet is constantly down. The tech support is deplorable. I would never go with them again. I am cutting my service off today.  There isn't much more to write. DON'T USE NEW MEDIA WEST FOR ANYTHING.

I'm going to start off by saying that they say that they close at 11 PM of which I think that they do however it must be noted that the kitchen closes at 10 PM. With that being said we got there at about 9:55 PM last night because I was at a speaking event and wanted some dinner. So we walked in and were told that the kitchen closes in a minute if you want to that they weren't sure if they were able to serve us so I initially got irritated but then the manager said out not a problem will be more than happy to serve you. Then we sat down and we ordered for it quickly out of respect for the kitchen because we didn't want to keep them there any longer than they had to be. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and my girlfriend ordered for tacos. My chicken sandwich was very good it came out nice and juicy I know what you see is a funny word but it did. The boar was a little too gamy for my girlfriend but that has no reflection on this restaurant or the food itself it's just the animal being a bore. What was really nice however unnecessary was that when I happen to tell my waiter he went to the manager and only charge half price for that. Again completely unnecessary but also very nice.  The lighting in there was good all of the TVs were nice it was an all-around chill place to go and I'm glad that we went there. It would've been nice if you would've been able to order dessert however again the kitchen was closed so will just have to go there a little earlier next time. I'm giving this five-star review because it meets all of my criteria.    One more massively huge point I must say about this place is that the tables come equipped with three prong outlets and USB outlets so that you never have to worry about your phone dying that is by far the best part about walking in that place that I found out.
