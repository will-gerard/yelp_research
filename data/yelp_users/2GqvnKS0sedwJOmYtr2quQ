Start off with the good parts, nice decor and antique shop feel cute store in the back and bathrooms are big. Bad parts, small portions  for the price, no refills on drinks, my burger was very tough, ice cream was so-so. Pretty dissatisfied with this place, will not be returning.

Amazing sandwich but if you like smaller portions just get a half. Great meat and service

I've lived in cave creek for 15 years and El Encanto  used to be a restaurant we are at weekly. I've seen the restaurant change over the last few years. El Encanto has always been slow service wise. Tonight was the first time we came for dinner in a few years with a large party and over an hour wait to be seated. Sorry your pollo fundido isn't good enough to make up for the horrible service. Highly disappointed.

Came here yesterday for lunch. I got the grilled chicken sandwich with fries. It was very good. The bun was soft and chicken was juicy. Love this place will be coming back!

I've been here a few times. Twice for lunch and once for dinner. I love it! Great food, great portions (enough for left overs which I love). And the service is great as well! Can't beat it.

My first time here was this morning and now I'm back again  this afternoon. Wonderful coffee shop and good stuff place. Still alot like The Willow feel and plenty of seats.  I know where I'm going instead of Starbucks. Love this place

Went there for breakfast this morning and we waited about 30-40 mins for food (mind you there was only two of us with simple orders), we used to come here often with family until the service went down hill, first time back in months sad to see nothing has improved. Also only got one coffee refill. Not our first time here but it will be our last, food was not amazing enough to make up for bad service.

Went here for breakfast today. Got the plain bagel with plain cream cheese and breakfast burrito with sausage. Have to say that I'm not impressed and the burro was very very bland. I give this place a "meh".

I go to Ari Sushi whenever I can. Good rolls, great price for the area (so close to scottsdale..) I just love pretty much everything about the atmosphere and feel of the place too. Nice for people who want a feel of a family sushi place. They actually place Japanese music too.

Came here for lunch. I got the general tso's chicken and It was wonderful. Big portions for a great price. First time I've ever enjoyed a egg roll in my life and that's saying something! Wonderful food will return.

Second time going to moon valley cafe. Food and service was wonderful.  **the only reason I'm giving it such a low rating is because they allowed a couple to eat inside the restaurant with their DOG sitting on the bench of the booth with them. That's unsanitary and they should have been told to eat on the patio with the dog. And this wasn't a service dog... Very disappointed

Had a lunch combo and a grab and how sushi. Combo wasn't good but the grab and go was much better. Not bad for a quick lunch.

Good fro-yo but even better service and neighborhood like atmosphere. Will be returning to Twirl in the future.

I got a bayalage from Jonathan yesterday. He did an amazing job on the color and blew out my naturally curly hair. All in all it was a wonderful experience. I highly recommend him.
