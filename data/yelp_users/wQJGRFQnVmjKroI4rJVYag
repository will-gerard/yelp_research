If you are looking for an honest and ethical doctor to help you make the right decisions when it comes to your mental health, don't go here.  My wife went to Dr. Zenner to update her medications as we had moved from Colorado to the Valley.  When she walked in, the waiting room was full of people.  She signed in and waited for more than 45 minutes past her appointment time before she went looking for someone to find out when she would be seen.  There was no staff at the desk and she had to go looking through the office to find someone to help her.  After getting to an employee, she told them that she had to get back to work and needed to know when she would be seen.  The employee responded "Patients are normally seen an hour after their appointment time".  Understandably, this upset my wife and she asked to reschedule.      When the office called her back she was told that the doctor did not want her as a patient and that her office co-pay would be refunded.  She was told they did not want patients that would walk out on appointments.  It wouldn't be so bad, but it was clear from her experience that they were trying to push through as many people as they could in as short a time as possible.  They had no care in how they approached their patients or their mental health needs.  The office was run down and the overall vibe was like being at the DMV.  Not good for someone who is supposed to be helping patients.       If you are looking for a good psychiatrist, we suggest you take Dr. Zenner's approach to his patients and fire him before you see him.

To me, giving a 5 star review means that a restaurant has reached the pinnacle of perfection, to which there is no doubt that Kai has attained.  This has become one of our families favorite places to go.  It is a true culinary experience.  We have been here three times and each visit had it's own highlights to make the visit memorable.  The ambience is impeccable; it isn't so much created by the decor but by the people serving you.  From the moment you arrive you are called by your name and treated like you are part of the family.  Every employee is attentive to make sure that you are comfortable and receiving the Kai experience.  Once you are seated you are treated to an explanation of the restaurant and it's vision.  They explain how everything from the menus (printed and placed in mesquite wood that was crafted from a member of the local tribe) to the food has been locally sourced.  You won't run out of options in terms of what your tastebuds may be tingling for as the menu provides a myriad of different options to satisfy your cravings.  Service is impeccable.  Upon our first visit we were actually a little startled when each of us had an attendant.  When your food is prepared they come out in one synchronous ballet to deliver your entrees at precisely the same moment.    When you leave and get into your car, you are greeted with a thank you card from your server, bottles of Voss water and personalized chocolates from the restaurant.  They really have thought of everything.  If you want to experience the very best that Arizona has to offer look no further than Kai.

I think that Frank and Lupe's must have had an off night when we got there...   It started with a margarita and when they delivered it there was lipstick on a dirty glass.  I asked for another and when they made it I could see they just poured the old marg into a new glass.  I'm not picky, but thats just a tad bit unprofessional.  The chips and salsa were great and my food tasted really good.  So why the bad review?  Food Poisoning...  The next 24 hours of my life after visiting Frank and Lupe's was horrendous.  I don't want to disparage a local business but after the experience with the margarita and my time in the emergency room, I can say I will never go back.  I suggest the owners of Frank and Lupe's do a top to bottom inspection of their kitchen as I got really, really sick.  I looked up the last inspection of the restaurant and it confirms some of why this may have happened:  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=inspectionResultsDrillDownAA&permit=FD-03075&business=&address=&insp_id=3430554

It was a truly disappointing experience. My wife and I had stayed here a couple of years prior and it was great. Since the 4th is a special time for our family (birthday's, anniversary's and such) we decided that we would all stay here. We checked in and we could see that the hotel was undergoing a remodel, but never suspected to what level. Once we checked into our rooms we all dressed for a swim and headed to the pool, which is one of the most beautiful in Arizona. We were shocked to find out the main pool was closed for renovation. Something that neither the person checking us in or the reservation site (Their business website) ever told us. The pool at the golf club was the substitute and was supposedly staffed. I will bullet point the rest:  1. Never once did we come across anyone at the pool area to serve food or beverage 2. We were not notified that tip was included for breakfast and double tipped, no one said a thing. Our fault, but still... 3. Went into the gold club to order some beers and when we asked what beers they had they said they had everything but Corona. Proceeded to ask for 3-4 beers and they said they were out of stock. When we asked "Well, why don't you tell us what you have and we will order." the bartender replied with a snarl "I already told you, everything but Corona!" What? 4. We went to dinner at the spotted donkey and we were treated like trash by the bartender there (We weren't having good luck with bartenders). When we sat down the food was good and we were treated well, but that bartender was just horrendous. My father has served this country proud for 35+ years and I was irritated that he and my family were treated so poorly. 5. The post outside our room was rotted out and it appears like it could collapse 6. We woke up to a mouse on our clothing and you could see that the door to the outside had been eaten through.  I went to the front desk to talk to a manager and he was busy and could take me at 10:15... then 10:25, then 10:30, then 10:45. I told him about my experience and he offered points but I said that I just wanted to do a price match per their price match guarantee policy and that I had to go, we had lunch at 11. I sent something to Hilton corporate and here is the response:   Thank you for your reply. My name is Danita.  It will be my pleasure to assist with your concerns regarding your stay at the Waldorf Astoria Boulders Resort & Spa, Curio Collection.   After reviewing your file, I see the hotel has been in contact with you during your stay and provided $108 in refunds to your account prior to check out to make amends for your experiences.  (headslap)   I don't want money or to be compensated I just want to be treated like a man who spent well over a thousand dollars on a weekend to be with my family and as a client who deserves the respect of just an honest apology. I have stayed with Hilton brands all over the world and the experience of this hotel and the overall lack of care by their corporate staff and this stay makes me NEVER want to stay in a hilton branded hotel again.

Awesome! Few British pubs in the area and this place gets it right! Awesome beer selection and the prices can't be beat. Try the shepards pie pasty if you have never tried one- simply fantastic. It truly felt like we were back in Europe... Try something different and go to Cornish Pasty.

When we moved to Arizona from Colorado in April, our dogs got really sick.  In June, we had to put our little dog, Minnie, to sleep because of persistent non-correctable back issues that put her in immense pain.  As soon as she was gone, out dog Titus became ill.  We took him to Dr. Heetland who helped us diagnose an anemia issue.  We did everything we could to save him but, his bone marrow stopped functioning and steroids did nothing.  There was nothing we could do long term.  The news was devastating to say the least.  Thank the good lord that we had a vet that cared about us and our dog as much as he would his own family member.  He treated us with absolute care and compassion and we could not be happier that he came into our lives at such a difficult time.  We know that he did everything he could to save Titus and keep us, as pet parents, as calm as possible.  Thank you Dr. Heetland and the staff of Arizona Animal Wellness Center.

My family and I love this place.  From the chicken pizza, to the shrimp to the amazing breakfasts, Joe's has become a staple of ours here in Gilbert.  The kids can't get enough of the farm atmosphere and we can't get enough of the food; which there is plenty of!  It may be a little pricey, but they give you your money's worth both in quantity and quality.  Don't leave without trying one of their delicious shakes.  Keep it up Joe's and we will keep coming back again and again.

Wow, just an amazing experience. The quality of the food was absolutely fantastic and the servers were great. We just happened to look them up as we were tired of eating at the resort where we were staying and we were glad to find them. Everything was just spot on... you can tell that this is the sister restaurant to Binkley's.

A five star review is a rarity for me to give.  It leaves no room for doubt that this is a business that has achieved the ultimate mastery of its craft.  If the purpose of the "The Mission" was to create an experience of latin flavors that both excite and dominate your palette with brutal efficiency, they indeed deserve this 5 star review.  On a rare occasion you get to experience something new.  Both my wife and I love latin food and we had heard plenty of buzz that The Mission was the place to go to feed this hunger.  The old world style of the restaurant is matched by the decor and place settings.  You get the feeling that you are somewhere deep within Mexico or Argentina once you take your seat.  The wait staff was courteous and explained each and every aspect to the menu.  From the delectable seafood soup to the various tapas and main dishes, we were well informed on what we could expect.  We tried a little bit of everything and I cant say as I have tried anything more delectable than the south of the border treats set before us.  Each dish gave a unique experience and flavor that kept the table quiet as we tried to mastermind how to describe these tastes.    If you want an evening out that will give you no less than an amazing meal with a lot to talk about afterwords, you should make The Mission your mission.

We went to The Keg to celebrate my Dad's 71st birthday and we are sad to say the experience was just bad. My Dad summed it up when we asked how his Prime Rib was and he uttered a choice adjective that I have never heard him say before.  I read the reviews and I wonder if we had dinner at the same place. The food was just bad.. The shrimp smelled as though it was a couple of days old and the quality of the rest of the food that came out seemed like it was better served at a truck stop than a $50/plate restaurant. The filet I had was really fatty and the mashed potatoes literally had no flavor.  When we compare The Keg to other premium Steakhouses throughout the valley, like Steak 44, there is truly no comparison in terms of the quality of the food. Our server was great, but holy cow do they need to work on their food.

Was in a car accident and had a concussion. The worst part was that my leg started to go numb and I was really worried about what it could have meant in terms of an injury. I had a pretty significant back surgery serval months before this and I just wanted to make sure I was OK. We waited for 2 hours in the ER and maybe 5 people were called back. We packed up and headed to Mercy Gilbert. The administration here needs to evaluate their ER... Stat.

I'm guessing that this is the basic business model for a car wash in the area is this:  1. Find the best sales person you can that could literally sell ice to an eskimo and put them at the front where the clients come in. 2. Promise the world when it comes to upgrading the wash. 3. Agree with anything the client wants to when it comes to what they want and just get them to pay.  The rest is really a crap shoot. Today, I took in my truck in and explicitly asked for nothing with gloss to be put on the dash as it blinds me for several days until the effect wears off. Additionally, the stuff they use soaks into the speaker grills and looks terrible once its baked in. I made myself exceptionally clear and they went ahead and put on the high gloss stuff. OK. I can handle it. The issue was that it was put on in a way that about 70% of the dash was covered with glops of the substance they used to clean it. I showed it to them, she went back in and it didn't look any different when it was done. I took it to the guy at the front to show him as I had made myself exceptionally clear. He told me to take it to the guy in the light blue shirt as it was his problem. I take it to the guy in the light blue shirt, he doesn't have time for me.  I suggest that someone, anyone, who has some money and wants to make people happy in south Gilbert builds a car wash that is actually honest and ethical. I think most of us are starting to get tired of this kind of treatment.

The owners of Some Burros need to do a secret shop to see what is happening at their restaurant.  We were in the mood for good mexican food and decided to give them a try.  When we came in and ordered, we began to feel that we may have made the wrong choice.  The kid at the counter had no interest in being there.  I understand that a job as a cashier is not ideal, but try your best to make the most of it.  My wife ordered a beer to which the kid responded "whatever".  I assume that is because he could not take the order due to his age, but his attitude seemed to be the norm at what is loosely described as a restaurant.  The food was horrendous.  My wife's taco shells were old and the beef tasted off.  All of our food was luke warm at best, just like the two beers we ordered.  The kid that brought out our food was kind enough, but his kindness could not make up for the quality of the food.  We left a comment card with my phone number so I could chat with the manager about the experience to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I don't want things for free, I just want owners to know what is going on so they can make their business better.  I did not get a call which leads me to believe either the comment card was tossed or the message did just not get through.  Some Burros could be great, but they need to get back to basics.

The death of a friend is never easy, but Dr. Caldwell made it as comfortable as possible.  Our little dog, Minnie, had been through a lot in the past couple of months.  She had ruptured a disk in her back and we were doing our best to keep her comfortable with doses of steroids and other medication.  The surgery to get her better had a 50/50 chance of success and costs anywhere between $5-10K.  We were hoping that she would be better when her steroids wore off, but she declined quickly.  She couldn't move and each touch made her cry.  We called the vet ahead of time to let them know we were on our way.  As soon as we arrived they rushed us into a room and made sure that we were comfortable.  They really did care about our situation and you could tell that they felt sorry.  Dr. Caldwell came in and explained all avenues for us to take before we euthanized our precious dog.  She was thorough in her thoughts, explaining that she thought perhaps our odds of success on the back surgery may be better than we had been explained in other offices.   We listened, asked questions and then we all agreed that we were making the right choice, she was simply in too much pain.  Dr. Caldwell made sure that minnie was always comfortable and did her best to keep us calm.  I could not have asked for a better vet to help us through what was a traumatic situation.  The costs were less than we thought they would be and I can say that we were treated with the utmost respect throughout our ordeal.  Thanks again to Dr. Caldwell and the people at the Gilbert Emergency Animal Clinic.

I hope that management sees this and does something about it. Your sales people are ridiculous. I understand you have to add on to the sale but lying is a whole different ball game. I asked for the VIP and when I requested they put the natural finish on the dash instead of the glossy, which I have done 10 times before, I had to upgrade to the platinum package I was told. I asked "why do I need to pay more for something that has never cost me extra in the past?" To which there was no answer, just more attempts to upsell. I hope the extra 5 bucks was worth it because I just want to get my car cleaned, not be hassled and asked 6 times if I want the detail now, in the future or 2 years from now. Relax and give the people what they want.

I used Shane's to help one of my employees that was having a consistent issue with his car.  Down time mean issues for our business and for our employee.  He had taken his Mazda to several "specialists" that charged him more than $1900.  They never fixed the problem... Their response, "We did everything the computer told us to!"  We had Shane and his time take a look and he had it diagnosed within hours.  A day later it was fixed for less than 30% of what had already been paid to fix the car.  I have come to know Shane and his family and I will say that you will not find a more honest car repair company in the Valley.  When you work with Shane's, you truly become one of the family.  Thank you Shane!

We moved close to Ryu about two months ago and we could not be happier with the food, the service or the experience.  You can tell that John and the group that manages this restaurant truly care about the experience you have.  The sushi is some of the best I have ever had, which is not something I say lightly.  Having grown up in the bay area, I was exposed to some of the best fish the world has to offer.  Sitting down in Ryu for one of their masterfully created sushi dishes it is hard not to imagine that you aren't in downtown San Fran... They are truly amazing artists.  The Teppanyaki experience is really amazing.  Whether its just for your family or you want to bring in business guests for something unique, you won't be disappointed.  The chefs are masters and your food will be as fresh, succulent as you could ever ask for.  You may have to wait sometimes for a seat, but sometimes the best things come with a little patience...

I met Allan and Sharon, the owners of Green Ninja, several weeks back and I am very glad that I did.  We were just winding down from a year long contract with another pest control company that gave us limited results.  The summer had been tough as we had been bit several times in the night, but we didn't know by what.  We sprayed several times hoping that would resolve the issue, but we had no luck.  Allan came over and looked at our home to determine if there was any issue with bed bugs.  He spent more than an hour taking apart the bed to see if he could find any of the little critters.  After coming up empty he looked around the whole house and found a couple of spider webs and other remnants of  pests.  He scheduled a time to come out and treat our home within 48 hours.  We were pleased to see Allan come back with the Green Ninja truck on a Saturday to take care of our home.  He took the time to make sure that any crack or crevice was treated and that we understood what our prior issues could have been.  It is clear that Allan and Sharon care about their business and their clients.  If you want someone that will genuinely care about you and your family, call Green Ninja.

Great concept guys, but both times we have been there all of our family members have been ill  for 24 hours afterwards. The food tasted good, but its just not worth the pain. I suggest the owners look into the cleanliness of the kitchens or the quality of the prep areas as its far more than coincidence that this happened to all of us on two separate occasions several months apart.

We were pretty excited when we first went to High Tide because of the recommendations on Yelp! Other than Ryu sushi that sits across the parking lot from High Tide, there isn't much in the way of really good seafood locally. The restaurant looks great and is adorned with high class appointments and a cool raw bar, but that was about where my attraction to High Tide ended.   The shrimp cocktail that came out clearly was a couple days old. When the shrimp starts to turn brown/grey at the ends, it's best not to serve it. The waitress kept forgetting portions of the order and when the food did come out, it hardly resembled the high cost of the meal. At the end of the day, if you are looking for a high end sea food experience, unfortunately you'll have to look elsewhere.

I really would not go anywhere else. My Dad and son went with me last time and they took great care of us. My Dad has Parkinson's and isn't the easiest to cut. Tony and team took the time to make sure we were all set, we won't go anywhere else...

We are so happy that Zella's opened up in the neighborhood. We have ordered from them on multiple occasions and have gone into the restaurant and every time they have been friendly and fast. The food is delicious... if you haven't ordered the large pizza, prep yourself for what appears to be 24 inches of pure goodness.   We can't recommend them enough.

This was my second time here and the food was fantastic. Ryan at the bar was extremely attentive and friendly. The food is reminiscent of what you would expect at an exclusive farm to table establishment. Well crafted, quality ingredients and plated perfectly.
