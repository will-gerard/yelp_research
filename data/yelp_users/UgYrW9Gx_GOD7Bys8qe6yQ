What a disappointment today! I have been a customer of Goldman's since its'. inception. Prices have gone up and up but I have noticed that service has been dropping since SAM (one of the family) has left. I do not mind paying, but Mrs. Goldman seems more mercenary and less concerned about your satisfaction. Today I ordered a roast beef sandwich, side of cole slaw and a piece of kugel and a Dr Browns soda. There was no one in the restaurant and a full staff. After washing my hands, sitting down at a table, reading the news on my iPhone, watching a couple come n and order and get served, I realized that no one had an idea what the hell I was doing there or that I had ordered and paid. I asked, at first politely, and they all looked up with the stare I most hate signaling, " Huh? What? Where? They went thataway . I have not a thought in my head." Then they went into a mode scrambling to find the order. ( Tough because there were 3 people in the restaurant and I was the only one who did not get ANYTHING!) Then Mrs. Goldman joined in the "what."  group because up until then she was diddling with a fax machine in plain view and did not have time to help me ( only time to take my $17 plus dollars). NO apologies.NO let me take something off the meal! NO , "Hey let's snap to it and get this gentleman served!!!!!!!"  I demanded my money back. Mrs. Goldman gave me the $ less the cost of the Dr Browns she opened for me! What is my point, after all, every restaurant has a lousy evening.  True. BUT, it's HOw the situation was handled that tells you that  the owner could care less about you and the service that you get. BAD SIGN!!!!  It tells me that GOLDMAN's is going down and that is too bad. STAY AWAY unless. you like stopping free falls. IF  she does not care about what you see, then what does she not care about in the kitchen?

Delta is apparently winning well deserved awards for lousy service! The NWA/Delta merger has not changed poor management and disenchanted, simply awful employees. When I mentioned my family Delta experience on my Facebook page, there was not one comment that was favorable. Like I have said before the management and rank and file rejects who could not make it for employment at Southwest, populate the staff at Delta.Delta- home of the rejected!!!!!!!!!

Great airline! Great crew! Everyone knows it.If you are lucky you get to work on SWA - better pay, etc. The rejects go to Delta.

Accents of the English which sound so classy to Americans do NOT make up for their COMPLETE disregard for the disabled.I made every attempt well in advance to get special seating for my son and for which I was happy to pay more and NOTHING was done!When I called customer service today the US rep could have cared less, did not apologize and offered NO help. It was basically TFB!  My son will sufer fir more than 10 hours tomorrow on a flight from London Phoenix and I can not help and BA NEVER had an interest in helping. I will let EVERY disability group in this country and UK know about BA insensitivity so that they can seek other airlines. PS They have a web page with disabled assistance but no specific contacts for those disabled.In other words, just bull but no action for those with disability. If you are disabled choose an airline other than BA whenever you can.

As being a seasoned traveler, DELTA airlines is quite SERIOUSLY an airline to avoid. There are still choices in airline section but Delta seems to have retained all the bad things of airline service. Try another airline! The details are not worth going over but my complaints are quite real.  There is no respect for the disabled.Their flight attendants are callous, poorly trained and to my amazement lie when confronted.Their disabled telephone line is staffed by thoughtless, crude individuals who explain why your disability is in essence NOT their issue!
