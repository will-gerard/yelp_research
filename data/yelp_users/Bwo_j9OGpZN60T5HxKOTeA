Rosita's Place is a Phoenix institution. Everyone who's anyone eats here, from former governor Bruce Babbitt to nobodies like me. My father used to tease me that I was "born with a spoon of Rosita's refried beans in my mouth;" I have been eating here for 40 years, and the waitress I remember from my childhood still works here.  From their humble beginnings on Buckeye road to their "new" (they've been here quite awhile) location on McDowell Rd near 24th street, the owners of this restaurant have won more accolades for delicious home-cooked Mexican food than anywhere else in the Valley of the Sun. The huge portions of food are cheap and consistently delicious, based on family recipes. You're likely to encounter a live mariachi band on weekends.   The red sauce is hotter than the green, but not by much - they'll both smoke your brains out of your skull. Everything is good. Keep returning until you've tried all of it. My favorites: chile relleno with rice, beans & flour tortilla, albondigas soup, carnitas plate, and the refried beans in general.  Maybe it's because I've been dining at Rosita's Place regularly for my whole life, and they know me, but I never get slow service as has been mentioned in other reviews. Also, if you think this place is in the ghetto, and you don't like that you have to park in back where you can't see your car while you eat, you're too sheltered - in case you didn't notice, there is always a paid attendant keeping an eye on the parking lot!

BEST dentist in Phoenix. Dr. Bracken has been caring for my family's teeth since before I was born. We are talking since the 1960's, friends. Though he has been in this career a long time, he shows no sign of slowing down or intention to retire. He loves his work.   Dr. Bracken's employees love him, and they don't leave. I don't think there is an office person or hygenist that hasn't worked there for more than 20 years.That is REALLY a testament.   The hygenists, Kathy and Donna, are SO gentle when they clean your teeth. The take whatever time is needed to do a great job without you feeling discomfort. And they are always, always pleasant and happy to be there.   The office staff always have a smile and chuckle for you.   Prices are unbelievably reasonable. I have no insurance, a cleaning, full X-Ray and exam by Dr. Bracken set me back less than $90. With no X-ray only $60. I never have to buy a toothbrush because they give you a brand new Oral-B with every visit, along with some dental floss.   Dr. Bracken is able to administer a local anesthetic so you don't even feel the needle prick. I've never been in pain during any procedure, cavity filling, etc. He explains everything and will take time to answer your questions. And he is so caring and cheerful he makes every encounter fun.    I will be shattered and lost should this wonderful man ever retire!

If you've been to any Oregano's anywhere, you know what the food here is like. If you like the food, you like it. I find it much too salty and not really worth the long wait.  This particular joint is always busy to the point of overcrowding for lunch and dinner. Service is good and they have outdoor seating. Despite decent servers you will have a wait, either to sit down at all, or quite a wait for your pizza. Takeout is a good option.   Parking is a problem because the restaurant doesn't have enough, so there is spillover into the local neighborhood. BE CAREFUL: People who have been drinking tend to drive out of there without even looking. Do not leave any valuables visible in your car, not even a CD. The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings. It's a good neighborhood, but buzzed, well-fed people are easy marks.  The negative review is because I think you can do a LOT better while supporting a locally owned place instead of a chain. And because I live in this neighborhood, and we have found Oregano's most unreceptive to working with the neighborhood residents to overcome parking and litter problems, and an increase in crime associated with these problems.

Cherry Blossom Noodle Caf√© used to be a wonderful restaurant. I don't know what's going on there now, but they appear to be having problems retaining good staff. Unfortunately this means the food quality has become very inconsistent.   Spicy Curry Beef Linguine used to be a favorite; it was mildly spicy and had delicious curry flavor. Now, it's too spicy to eat, all from jalapeno peppers, and meanwhile the curry sauce has turned into a vague, bland gravy with no curry subtlety.   Meals come with free, fresh baked bread, which is nice. The owners briefly experimented by removing the free bread offering, but it returned a couple weeks later due to customer complaint. Lesson: don't remove the niceties your customers have come to expect from you.   The service here used to be fabulous; now it is mediocre on a good day and terrible on a bad day. You will be held hostage for your check. Your waiter will come ask "is everything alright?" before you have taken your first bite of food and then never return to see if you need anything else, avoiding all attempts at eye contact.

The quality of food here is fantastic. Very good value for the price. They are happy to customize anything for you, especially the pizza. There are vegetarian options. Good salads and sandwiches. Tasty pasta dishes. Free wifi. They sometimes have live entertainment that not everyone appreciates (psst, the musician is the owner's son) - if that's you, just order takeout. The pizza here is better than anywhere else in a 5 mile radius.

TexAZ Grill does one thing & does it well: STEAK. (Actually, they'll cook yours to order, not just well.)   You'll get a reasonably priced, delectably tender portion of your favorite cut of meat. Their mashed & baked potatoes are good, so is the coleslaw. Salads are lackluster, mostly iceberg lettuce, cardboard-like tomatoes, served as a vehicle for the dressing. But you don't go to TexAZ for rabbit food, you go for meat. And Texas beer.   Best steak within 20 miles.   Used to be the best deal around, too, but as of mid-2008, prices have been raised - plan on $20+ per person if you want a meal and a beer, $14-17 per person if you just drink water.

This should be a four- or five-star place. But the service brings it down. The bagels are excellent, and there's nothing wrong with the food. But the staff leaves the coffee too long - it always tastes burnt / bitter / terrible (just go next door and get a Starbucks). They also take no interest in the cleanliness of the place - I have never seen someone come out and wipe down tables or sweep up debris. Staff turnover is high and competence is low; they tend to have an attitude.

Lunch is a great deal at Flavors of India: buffet style with an excellent variety of food. Dinner is more expensive. Their food is very good except for anything with beef in it. Honestly, you can't expect a culture that believes cows are sacred to know how to cook beef for American diners. Theirs is boiled to the texture of tough shoe leather every time. So, avoid the beef. Everything else is delicious and you can't go wrong.

We love coming here. Hole in the wall feel, but the prices are reasonable and the food is very good. They make little improvements to the decor as they can. The place is clean and the staff are very friendly. I can't find anything not to like.

Enjoyable downtown pub. I almost always stop here when I'm downtown late at night. It's an institution, for sure.

Great spot for lunch or dinner. Reasonable prices, good food. They get very busy on weekdays so come early or late for lunch if you want to be seated right away. The owners are friendly and they get to know their regular customers.

Huge, delicious portions at an incredible value. I'm hooked.  I really enjoy the egg rolls. The pho is delicious, and you can trick it out with the crazy assortment of sauces and condiments available at every table.  The lemongrass tofu is very good. My favorite menu item so far is the utterly divine wonton soup, with a wonderfully rich broth, tasty wontons and a great variety of vegetables all striking the perfect balance of tender and crisp.  The interior is clean, including the bathrooms. The service is good - our waitress remembered our drink and heat-level preferences after our first visit! And has brought us a free dessert every visit! I can't help but feel taken care of, both in her concern for my enjoyment and in the freshness and high quality of the food served to me.

I am a sucker for fresh & local. Lux Coffeebar is certainly both. They roast their own coffee and bake their own goods, all of which are excellent. The staff are genuine and friendly, not salesy. They want you to have a good experience and come back. The art on the walls rotates frequently. They play good music, though at times it's a little loud for conversation if you're sitting inside. They have shaded outdoor seating with misters to help you stay cool during the summer heat. And they provide free wifi. This is an excellent spot. My favorite passtime: ordering a latte so I can watch the barrista pour me some art on top.

Matt's Big Breakfast is THE best breakfast in Phoenix. Fresh, organic, and wherever possible, LOCAL ingredients, cooked up to perfection. Delicious coffee. Crowded, especially on weekends. Worth the wait. Get there early or after rush hour on weekdays. Worth every penny.

Watch where you sit if you want to have a conversation. The barkeep will blast the music even if you complain it's so loud it's causing pain. The place also acoustically amplifies the already loud drunk customers. Noise aside, the food and service are great. The beer is just the right temperature, too. Delicious burgers, and Rosie is the best, addressing everyone as 'love."

Copper Star is a drive-thru and sit-down coffee shop that serves locally roasted, fresh, hot coffee, frozen coffee drinks, smoothies and fresh baked goods. They also have a few sandwiches and a delicious hummus plate that comes with kalamata olives and warm pita bread. I think they now have a daily homemade soup as well. And during the last holiday season, the owners wife was spotted making homemade pumpkin pies! I don't think anything on the menu is more than $5.50.   Nice atmosphere, not too crowded, not too loud. Free wifi - the password is on the wall above the hallway to the restrooms. A great neighborhood place to hang out, but you can also drive through. Great service. Cheerful staff. Delicious goods. And you can feel good about supporting local business instead of a huge soulless chain. The owner, Bill, is super friendly.  My one gripe is they have had the same two couches and red lounge chairs pretty much since they opened, but I don't think they have EVER cleaned them. They now look disgustingly filthy and I'm always shocked when I see someone actually go sit down at them. I can't sit over there, I have to keep to the wood chairs and tables. I go to Copper Star once a week, but the filth on the fabric covered seating is grossing me out enough that I may reduce my visits until they have the upholstery cleaners come in.

Americanized Mexican food. Decent but not authentic. Not sure about the cleanliness at this one. Good service, a bit pricey for what you actually get. They sell silly souvenir cups with some of their margaritas - don't buy those, you'll just pay way too much for a plastic monstrosity.

This is a late night drive-thru liquor store rebranded to appear upscale. The clientele seems to consist of people on their way to a party, alcoholics and homeless people. The owners are rude and unfriendly. The place reeks and is a large source of nuisance and pollution to the surrounding neighborhood. Lots of smash & grab crime on the surrounding street. Overpriced goods. Definitely NOT the place to go if you are actually looking for a decent selection of fine wines.

If you like all your food sweet, this is your joint. I went with a group of three. The other two really liked their food, I did not. To my palette, all the dishes were overly sweet and terribly bland. I prefer more savory fare in the mix. And, call me crazy, I like to be able to distinguish individual flavors. The food was inexpensive, but that's all it had going for it.

Good food. Awful service. The waiter was nowhere to be found when we needed our check, even though we slotted 2 hrs to get through our meal, kept our order super simple, & told our server upfront when we needed to leave. We had to ask 2 other staff and finally chase him down on foot as he walked away while we continually said "excuse me." I won't be back.

They get a two for being open crazy early (5:00am) when I need breakfast on the way to work.   But at that hour the staff always has music to their taste playing loud enough in the house to be heard on the back. The woman at the counter screamed three greetings to me as I approached the counter, none of which I could hear over the pop song on loudspeaker.  Had to yell my order to be understood. Then had to wait getting a headache from the loud music while the counter help screeched three times for a cashier as she threw my order together so sloppily it was totally unappealing. Not a pleasant experience at all.

They have burgers, hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. A meal deal means you get an entree with a side of fries and a can of Shasta, which is actually a really good deal for this sort of all-American lunch. The burger buns seem to be freshly baked, not the crummy kind you buy in a bag of  8-12. They've still got a light dusting of flour on the top, and they're delicious. My husband is the pickiest meat eater, but so far he's found nothing to nitpick about with these burgers - not even a teensy bit of gristle. The fries aren't the best I've ever had, but they've been consistently hot and lightly salted, which is how I like them.

It's a chain, so you know what you're getting. The food is fresh and very good, the service is fast and friendly. I would give it five stars except there is the occasional piece of gristle that does not get trimmed out of the meat (usually in the chicken or steak, never in the pork or shredded beef).

Decor has a cute Dia de los Muertos v+ modern urban feel. Seating is comfortable.  Pretty good draft and bottled beer options.    I tried an Al Pastor and a Carnitas taco. Both were too greasy but were seasoned ok. But they were a big disappointment because both the corn tortillas and meat filling were cold. I hope I don't get food poisoning from the under temp meat. It might have been hot when they scooped it onto my plate, but had gone cold by the time I paid and sat down. This is even though there was only one person ahead of me in line.   They had 2 assembly line workers during lunch rush - just not effective to move the line fast enough. It only got worse after I made it through the line. And staff were initially friendly but showed their stress as they got more and more overwhelmed. Tables weren't being wiped down either, so you had to clean a place to sit down. If you come in and see only 2 people working, walk out and go somewhere else.
