Great beer selection. Great specials. Frustrated when our clueless server didn't offer happy hour prices 4 minutes before happy hour and then still didn't offer them when we brought it up.

The new Lux is amazing! In addition to the aspects that haven't changed, like serving the best espresso in the Valley combined with one-of-a-kind baked goods and the best quiche I've ever had (in the mornings), Lux has a brand new space and now serves dinner, wine, bottled beer and some pretty amazing cocktails from scratch (my margarita was made with egg whites!).  The other thing that hasn't changed is the friendliness of the staff and the welcoming atmosphere.  Lux feels a lot like home to me, only the food is better than anything I've got in my fridge and the people give me something really interesting to get distracted by!

Awesome spot. Great beer, great food. $5 pitchers and glasses of wine for happy hour. AND, check this out, best ice cream I've had in Phoenix next door at Churn.

It's great to have good, local ice cream in downtown Phoenix! And, the outdoor seating at this place is perfect and much safer for kids than Pink Spot. The people here are friendlier than at MacAlpine's, and it's easier to park than Churn.
