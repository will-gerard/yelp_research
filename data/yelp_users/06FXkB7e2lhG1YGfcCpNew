Biggest crown on the rocks I have ever had.....ever.  The lady bartender who's name I cant remember was awesome.  It was a tuesday night and was kinda dead but I still had a great time.

Amazing hamburgers!  Pretty sure the owner was working when we went and he gave the kind of genuine service that makes you instantly want to go back to a place without even eating the food.  Really want to try there breakfast.

I absolutely loathe Best Buy and the only reason I went was to pick up a dvd that no one else close had.  I went in grabbed the dvd went to the back check out bc we were going to shop in the mall.  Guy in appliances immediately asks if we need to check out and then says, "Let me call someone up" instead of doing it himself.  We sat there for at least five minutes while he stared into space 10 feet away from us.  I wanted to flip out but it would have probably taken a half hour to get anyone of importance to bitch at.   Finally a girl walks up and 30 seconds later were in the mall.  Was that so hard stupid appliance guy?

Biggest baked potato I've ever seen....and it was delicious.  Turkey sandwich was extremely plain and boring but the bp made up for it.  I recommend just for that.

Had an all meat calzone that was really good.  They used a lot of ricotta cheese in it which brought a nice balance to the usual overwhelming taste of the normal ingredients in a calzone.

The chipotle where im from is busy with a line all hours of the day and it sucks. I walked right in to this one , got my carnitas bowl and walked right out.  The place was really clean and the people working seemed cool.  Will be going back.

Randomly ended up here after not being able to decide what to eat and just driving by it.  It looked busy so that's usually a good sign.  No available table's so we sat at the bar.  The bartender an lady in her mid 30s to early 40s was extremely nice.  My gf wanted a certain drink she had never heard.  She said she would go look it up, I offered her my phone and within a minute we googled the recipe and she had already made it.  We ordered food and were both very happy.  The chicken club damn near perfect enough said.  Will definitely be going back.

I really dont eat a lot of fast food but have a weak spot for JIB bacon and cheddar wedges.  The reason I am rating this so high is since Ive lived in az ive been to this JIB 4-5 times and every time the person in the drive thru is extremely cheerful and nice and one time they were out of wedges and when I pulled up he insisted on giving me something free even tho I refused bc it wasnt a big deal.

The place smells horribly, food was ehh, and the poker room is weak.  Never going back to this place again.

I've been to a bunch of D&B's in California and always have a great time.  Granted Ive only been to this Tempe location once, but that one experience saw extremely poor service both with our waitress when we ate and at the bar getting drinks and it wasnt busy at all.

Went here before a movie.  Drinks were weak and the chicken alfredo was extremely bland.  This place is all decor and atmosphere.

Went for drinks on Saturday night.  Arrived at 9pm and the place was packed but cleared out around 1130.  The pomegranate sho chu was amazing and for 8 bucks a carafe you cant wrong.  I will be going back there again.

Went for lunch after golf.  Hamburger was amazing and reasonably priced at $9.  Met and talked to the owner the whole time and he was a great guy.  Overall very pleased and will be attending more.

Unlike other reviews I had a rather pleasant experience at Qdoba's.  It was my first time there and I loved the food.  I am not a fan of spicy food and that has to be the reason I prefer this place over chipotle.    The steak tacos were fairly high quality as far as taste goes for $6 tacos.  There 3 cheese sauce was a little spicy but a new taste for me that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Great food and solid poker room.  Drinks and food are half off as of now in poker room.  Ive ate a few different things and they were all good.  The place looks great as well and all the employees Ive interacted with have been really cool.

Everyone loves this place. I've had it a few times now and still think it is just OK.  The pizza always has way too much sauce and the sauce isnt really that good.

I usually love going to this place but the service was extremely slow at this location and it wasnt that busy.

Extremely cheap and the portions are the biggest Ive ever seen for a Mexican food place.  The Carne Asada fries are amazing.  You cant expect top quality steak from a place like this but I actually thought it was really good.

Poker room doesnt have a lot to offer in the way of cash games but the tourneys have a god slow structure, employees are really cool and professional, food is amazing and the poker room is far enough off to the side that it doesnt smell of cigarettes.  Only gripe is drinks are overpriced and weak, however I have been comped a few times.
