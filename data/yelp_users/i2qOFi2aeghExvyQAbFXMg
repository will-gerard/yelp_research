7/4/13  Dinner  My third time dining at Mon Ami Gabi doesn't disappoint. For a French steak restaurant on the Strip, this place offers great food at a great value. My party of 4 arrived promptly for 6:30pm reservation. Surprisingly we were offered the option of indoor dining or the patio outside overlooking Bellagio fountain across the street. Patio is usually first come-first serve but on a 108F day we just didn't feel like eating outside. Plus all the hustle-and-bustle on the street.  Server was friendly, ready to make cocktail suggestion. Despite being very busy for 4th of July, service was not pushy at all. We spent almost a cocktail's time looking over the big menu, which features grain-fed Mid-West beef.  *Paris Romance ($12): a rum base cocktail with a tinge of lemoncello.  *Grey Goose Cosmopolitan ($14): just the way I like it, a slightly more vodka compared to cranberry juice, fresh lime (there's pulp) a beautiful pink  Our table goes for beef since this is a classic French bistro specializes in meat.  *Chicken Liver Mousse Pate ($10.95): the tangy red wine mustard goes really well with the very creamy liver spread on warm toast. It really set the mood of dinner for the evening.  *Filet Mignon Merlot ($34.95): very tender, almost like Wagyu, beef seared to a medium-rare pink, with a butter/red wine reduction. I've had Harris's filet mignon and loved it. But Mon Ami Gabi is just as juicy, and every bite of meat is "even." This is one of the best filet mignon I have had. The handcut frites are warm crispy, with the texture of sliced potato chips. They give you so many that I couldn't finish.  *Steak Classique ($24.95): a slimmer cut sirloin steak served with house-special herb butter. My BF also had it medium rare and it was pink like mine. He did better with the frites and licked the plate clean.  *Steak Au Poivre ($25.95): probably the strongest tasting steak on our table, served with a brandy peppercorn sauce. Our dining companion also opted her sirloin medium rare. I was very impressed at the overall consistency in how their meat was prepared here.   *Prime Cheeseburger ($12.95): with blue cheese. This is a Mon Ami Gabi's classic and they charge the same price as for lunch. Medium cooked beef patty served on a brioche bun. Instead of fries, my dining companion got French green beans on the side.   We concluded the meal with warm chocolate torte and assorted sorbet. The whole experience---food, service, drinks, and decor, is top-notch but you pay decent prices for it. It's one of the best value on the Strip. Make sure you have a reservation. I always have dinner here when I'm in Vegas.

7/6/13  The Pyramid appeal stops at the lobby here. We were stuck in Las Vegas for an extra day because of a plane crash in San Francisco. Being an upper-tier member of United, the airline offers us a crashpad at Luxor, which, to me, is a dump.  *Pyramid room 13011. Piping hot even the curtains were drawn---the gurgling air condition unit is barely working. We decided to drop off the bags and luggage, go out to grab food and come back to see if the room had cooled down. About two hours later we returned, the room hardly cooled, and the hallway outside was way cooler than the room No refrigerator. No ice bucket. No bottled water. WTF?!  *Called front desk and got the response that they were completely full house. The clerk said she would send an engineer to examine the a/c but could not say how soon the engineer will be there. After the airport delay and cancellation, we were not in the mood to be out and about in the heat. We just wanted to rest so we asked for a new room. The request was denied by Shelley.  *She did offer a room on the 2nd floor in the Pyramid, but only if the engineer came to confirm a/c unit is not working. *SIGH* Later they relented to give us the room so we packed up again and went down to front desk again to exchange room. Another clerk, who was way more sympathetic with our situation, offered us free upgrade to a room on 7th floor in the West Floor. So much better, and cooler, with  much better fixtures and amenity.  *New room (West Tower 7212) is nice enough, but nothing like what I'm used to. They have NO IN-ROOM WIFI despite the mandatory $18 resort fee. No complimentary bottled water. No refrigerator. No rain shower.   Overall this is not my kind of hotel. Poor choices of restaurants, more catering toward the chain-restaurant/fastfood crowds. Hallways reek of cigarette. Poor noise insulation. It is no wonder this is offered as a free crashpad. Luxor is definitely on the low end of the Strip. Tropicana across the street has a makeover so spare yourself from this horrible hotel if you prefer a room in the $30-$60 price range. We didn't even bother to hang around here, spent most of the next 32 hours in Mandalay Bay.

7/4, 7/6/13  Breakfast  I made a point to not dine at the bland and pretentious Society Cafe at Encore again since my last visit to Vegas. Terrace Pointe is Wynn's counterpart (table service, higher end) minus all that Iron Chef hype. What I like most is the outdoor dining patio overlooking the Wynn pool. The dining room is very spacious with high ceiling and a full bar. They do have a strict dress code IN THE DINING ROOM: no tank top for men (which I brazenly perpetrated on an 115F day) and no sheer cover-up for ladies. I care less because I come for the patio.  We made two visits this 4th of July weekend for breakfast; both service and food were distinctive. Like I mentioned in my review of Peppermill Lounge, prices are steep in Vegas unlike you do the food court plastic tray thing. Terrace Pointe is actually very reasonable consider you can very good service in a fine decor.  *Oatmeal ($14): with sliced banana, raspberries, blackberries, walnuts, raisins all in separate mini cups. The perfect healthy option to begin the day. My companions also had mini morning buns.  *Brioche French Toast ($16): I surrendered to my long craving. This is some of the best French toast I've had. Dipped in egg and cinnamon batter, with candied walnuts, caramerlized banana and toffee brittle. The toffee is too sweet and is not my thing. I peeled off the caramel off my banana. French toast itself is excellent.   *Huevos Rancheros on Skillet ($17): fluffy scrambled egg on a bed of refried beans. I don't remember this item from last time. My companion said it was tasty.  *Pancakes and Eggs ($17): their pancakes are too thick to my preference, but crispy and not chewy. Bacons crispy and scrambled eggs are far better than Peppermill and other breakfast joints around the strip.   *Classic Breakfast ($17): three eggs any style, in my case scrambled, with bacon or sausage. Apple chicken sausage is better than Peppermill and Society Cafe. Potato are thinly sliced and roasted, almost like warm potato chips!  I notice this time that they no longer offer the Double Down Breakfast which allows you to choose any two breakfast items for $18. Inflation?  Overall verdict: The perfect breakfast spot if you want a relaxing, quiet, and beautiful environment with great service. That it's in the Wynn suggests the clientele is more polished. Sometimes I come in here and just read over coffee, which is served in a thermal, before I order food. They just leave me alone. It's my staple breakfast joint in Vegas.  They don't take reservation so get there early on holidays.

Period of Stay: 10/20-10/22/12 City View Studio, Room 5123  I booked through Hotwire, which guaranteed me a 5-star/luxury hotel on the north end of the Strip. I weighed my chances---it would be either The Venetian (which I don't like), The Wynn, The Encore, or Trump. I was excited that I got Trump because it's non-gaming, meaning it's smoke-free.  I don't agree with Donald Trump's political agenda, but we are on the same page in terms of customer service and expectations. Trump belongs to the class of hotel that showcases a subdued luxury. You don't see anything gaudy or flamboyant, nothing chic or rustic, just grandeur and elegance. Gold is the theme here.  The front desk staff was professional, friendly, and warm. He accommodated us early, since we got there at around 10. The room was not yet ready, but we were checked in, and baggage safely stored with the concierge. About 15 minutes into breakfast on the strip, the front desk called and informed me that the room was ready and I could just pick up the keys.  We were put up in Room 5123 on the 51st floor. Since it was a Hotwire deal for $105 a night, I didn't expect to be upgraded to the Strip View Studio. The room is spacious, and clean, with a kitchenette full of cookware and flatware.  (+) beautiful rooms (+) Italian marble floor in bathroom (+) Jacuzzi tub + shower stall (+) TV embedded in mirror in the bathroom (+) bathrobe (+) 400-count thread bedding (+) two upholstered chairs and a three-seater couch (+) 37" flat screen TV (+) fast wi-fi connection (with resort fee) (+) complimentary shuttle service to Wynn and Caesar Palace (+) nice pool on the 6th floor terrace  (-) limited dining choices (-) shuttles discontinue at 12 midnight (-) expensive drinks at H2Eau, the pool-side bar  I heard people complain how inconvenient location is. True that Trump is not on the Strip but it's just an easy 5-minute walk. You can go across the street to Nordstrom and walk through Fashion Mall and be at the strip in 10 minutes tops. Service here is top-notch. I never had to push open the doors here at the lobby. Doormen are efficient and polite. That the hotel is non-gaming means it's smoke free and free of casino foot traffic.   Trump is truly the home away from home in Vegas. I will definitely come back to stay here. If you want quietness, and minus all the hustle and bustle of the strip but atleast close enough to the actions, this place is it.

7/4/13  Mandarin Oriental is the synonym to swankiness and luxury. The Las Vegas counterpart certainly doesn't disappoint. On the night of the 4th we were at the bar to watch the firework, away from the hustle-and-bustle of the strip.  All drinks here, martinis, cocktails--are $18 each. But you have to see the amazing view of the Strip through its floor-to-ceiling window. Tables line up by the plate glass and there are big couches for groups. Tasty Asian-style trail mix.  The scene is mellow. It's loungy, elegant, and swanky. Music is not too loud and obviously this is not a destination for the riffraff party crowd. You can actually carry a conversation here. I recommend a reservation here on weekends and holidays.

7/7/13  A plane crash at San Francisco Airport forced us to stay an extra day in Vegas. After we checked out of Mandalay Bay and had our luggage stored, we walked around and stumbled into the Four Seasons, which is encapsulated around the Mandalay ground. Their pool is right next to the Mandalay Beach separated by partition.  So we were killing time until it was time head back to McCarran.  PRESS is a lounge overlooking the pool area. It consists of a full bar and a coffee/espresso stand. You can make purchase of coffee/tea and pastries and sit at the lounge, or order cocktails from the bartender. PRESS have plug-ins to recharge your iPhone and iPod dock. There's complimentary wifi. We split our time between the cozy indoor lounge and the poolside wicker chairs outside. It's perfect for catching up with friends or just chilling, reading a book.  A cosmopolitan is just $12 here---yes, at the Four Seasons and service is impeccable. They turned on the mist outside and parts of the section have cushioned booths that sit up to 10. It's a gorgeous beautiful place hidden away from the Strip. I'll definitely return for drinks in the future.

Café Tranquilo is the restaurant of Clarendon Hotel, where we stayed for two nights in Phoenix. Each hotel guest receives a complimentary breakfast voucher good toward $12.50 worth of food excluding alcoholic beverages. It's a great value and very kind of the hotel.  We just ate dinner here the night we arrived from PHX. Complimentary chips and salsa were served as soon as we sat down. In addition to salsa, they also gave us avocado dip, mole chili, and chili verde. The chili verde was my favorite and chips were bottomless! Moscow Mule was put in its right place as Tranquilo serves it in a tall trim copper cup. Cosmopolitan is a pretty pink in a champagne glass.  Tacos are all a la carte. Out of the three my favorite was the beer battered fish. Batter not too thick and it came with a tangy mayo sauce. Carne asada is just okay, with a smokey taste to it. The braised tinga pork was also tasty. Pork was tender and not stuck in the teeth.  For breakfast, they have a big selection including gringo (regular bacon and egg), chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, French toast. Their coffee is excellent, not the cheap watery stuff from a can. It's a breakfast blend with an aroma. Coffee is always piping hot.   *Gringo Breakfast ($7.5) two eggs any style with choice of bacon or sausage. Bacon is inconsistent between the first morning and the second. Maybe the chef took the day off after being slammed on Fourth of July. The fried potato is diced and sauteed with onion and bell pepper.   *Chilaquiles ($10) is a bit too chili-ish. The sauce is very red and the taste very strong. Diced chicken with two overeasy eggs. It's not my favorite chilaquiles but it's adequate enough.  *Mushroom and Spinach Scramble ($9) is much better than the chilaquiles. Two scrambled eggs tossed with chopped mushroom and spinach. It's very good with melted oaxaca cheese. Totally hit the spot, as I love scramble.  Coffee and water are always refilled with a smile. It's a very friendly and casual dining atmosphere.
