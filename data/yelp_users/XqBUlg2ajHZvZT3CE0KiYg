I love pep boys. As a female, I get ripped off a lot at auto shops. I have never had this problem at pep boys. The employees are always straight-forward, honest, and helpful. Today Gayle and Brandon went out of their way to make sure my car was fixed in time for my early morning interview tomorrow. I will be returning!

The security tried to hustle us last night. We had been there for an hour and went to the balcony to get some fresh air (the bar was hot AF) and when we tried to return inside they said we had to buy another drink or else we had to leave. This was after we had all purchased multiple drinks
