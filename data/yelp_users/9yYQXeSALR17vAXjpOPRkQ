India Palace has an authentic atmosphere that never feels too loud or cramped. The food is fantastic, portion appropriate and deliciousness renditions of all types of cuisine from India. Though it is a simple gesture, I absolutely love getting complimentary papadom and sauces with every meal, and then their rice is amazing (I don't even like rice) with a refreshing touch of cumin.   The staff and hostess are always incredibly friendly and personable.

Having lived in China, I'm still willing to make huge concessions for American Chinese cuisine, but I can't for this place. Everything tastes subpar, bland to no flavor, and the quality of meats was noticeably poor.

While the service was nothing spectacular to boast of, the open kitchen, and the arthritic layout of the restaurant makes it appealing for both ambience and conversation. The food was good, with many hearty and warm dishes that are seeming comfort food with a great healthy perspective. Also, thorough enjoyed the ever changing list of mocktails for non-drinkers.

The toppings for their pancakes were not my favorites, but that may be personal taste. Very reasonable price for a wonderful portions of food and fresh flavors, especially in the omelettes.
