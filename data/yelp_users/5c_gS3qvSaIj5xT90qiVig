Ashley was my server and offered superb service! Awesome atmosphere, wood fire oven pizza, and really good gelato! My favorite is the cinnamon flavor.

Had a coupon for a pizza bread sticks and a soda for $15 and they were out of bread sticks and the lady that was on the phone said that she can add on bread sticks for an extra $1 and it came out to be $21 instead of just $16. Then she said that it would take 55 min to deliver! You would think that a reasonable person would tell you that before you spend 10 mins of your life placing your order. So I told her to cancel the order and then the unprofessional retard just hung up without saying a word.
