Mark is hilarious one of the best bartender around. You get dollar you call it on Monday's. This review on that since I go often. Sometimes wish food was served later past midnight. Overall good place for drinks

You ask yourself why this McDonald s is still open and yet it is. I wish this location was 24 hours but you have to go another mile or two down the road. My biggest complaint is service time. Waited in line to get an order and it looked like the co workers didn't want to do it. It's like a lack of enthusiasm or something. One star is being generous and wish this place can do a lot better

Saw naruto the last movie here. I remember service was fast and the atmosphere was amazing. Will go here again if they keep getting films like these.

Cine Capri is amazing. Seats are comfortable. Had not had one bad experience here at all. On big screenings like star wars it was easy to see it due to available showings. The way they address lines are very professional.

Regular. Nice to meet new ppl and play games. Just wanna hang go here. Drinks are pricy but great names they use based off games and all. Go when there is an event the atmosphere is better.
