This place is such a find. Let's start with the chips & salsa because that's really what melts my butter. Perfection! chips were thin, crispy, hot. The salsa was the perfect consistency, not the Hot Ketchup variety & none of that we opened a jar of Pace Picante, hahaha these stupid gringos!  I mean, honestly, my Mexican food standards are not that demanding. Give me the same quality I could make at home without having to drag out my food processor & I'm your best friend.   Rice & beans were good, typical, but good. Tortillas are exactly like my grandma's, probably full of lard (sorry if they're not but I don't see this place making the Jenny Craig hitlist anyway). And lard is necessary to build your quality cellulite. That, and butter slathered on the lard laden tortillas; now the clouds have parted.   I ordered the chile relleno plate and the chile relleno was very satisfactory - the batter could be a tad flufflier but, hey, who's measuring. On another visit, I ordered the chicken taco. The chicken was moist & shredded, very good. are the hard shells handmade? I detected a slight comparison to Lawry's but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I love the shredded lettuce on everything. It's very Baja & makes me feel a little better about the fact that I've completed reversed the effects of 4 hours of Insanity Workout.   The person who complained about the service should go to Macayo's or Arriba's (excuse me as I hork all over my keyboard). Ok, better now. if you are looking more streamlined, corporate, dining process, these places will be little gems for you. (heheheee)

Excellent all across the board. The bread is amazing with the olive oil dip. My mother-in-law is from the central region of Italy and this is her favorite place to go they even gave us complementary limoncello as an aperitif amazing. My favorite menu item is probably the lasagna or the homemade ravioli. My 1 & only complaint would be the lemonade I understand this is definitely an adult restaurant but we always bring our kids as they are little foodies in the making. I can tell the lemonade is some sort of Minute Maid / country time whatever & my kids drink it but they don't really like it and as high class as this places I think everything should be top notch. May I suggest buying Simply Lemonade from Frys or Safeway? It's really not that much more expensive and it literally tastes like it was made from scratch. Otherwise this place is perfection.

We went there valentines night I guess they weren't expecting that many people and I also think they were short staffed. Our server was Andrew hope I'm getting the name right. Young guy with brown hair and glasses absolutely amazing. For how slammed that poor guy was customer service his attitude and his attention to detail was outstanding. The queso is amazing I would just say to serve it though with regular chips not a fan of the flour crisps. Their chips and salsa are probably the best in the valley except for maybe los dos molinos but that is very far from where we live. son got the Carne asada wow the meet is so tender and great flavor. Other son bean burrito  fine husband Carnitas very good. My only negative feedback is I ordered the chili relleno and it was definitely not the best I've had. The batter used to coat it is very odd it's like a crusty omelette s/b fluffy and soft and the chile itself inside was too crispy it should be cooked thoroughly & easy to cut w/ a fork. However the ranchero sauce is very good maybe they can work on the other 2 issues. But not everything can be perfect so I'm OK with it. Next time I think I'll order the beef hard taco that's my other go to. I love that they serve Coke products I mean who serves Pepsi products anymore? I will continue to go here with my family and each time I'll try something different until I figure out what my favorites are

This place really needs to have 5 stars, why doesn't it??? what an amazing value!!! Saturday, Aug 24 my son had his 7th birthday at 10am - 12:30 session. They even threw in a free lesson at 9am before his party which helped tremendously. The package I ordered (which was basic & very affordable more may be included with other packages that cost more I don't know). Included pizza, drinks, tokens, wheel of fortune spin, personalized song dedication by DJ with all kids getting a trip to the soundbooth, plenty of announcements over the loudspeakers for his birthday, when they were eating cake, etc.   Our server Vince informed us that he was 'newer'. However, I never would've known. He was extremely well spoken, professional, informed me at every chance of what was going on & what the timeline was of the party, any needs I had & did I have any questions. We have had parties at the park, at Peter Piper's, etc. I will never do that again. We will have our parties here, unless we are out of state, which happens sometimes.   The manager Rodney was so patient, helpful & organized. When one of the children fell, we were met immediately with a skate referee to help us off the rink & asked if we needed first aid or ice.   I am seriously blown away by the affordability of this place with all the extras included, the great music, the instructors & the cleanliness of the facility. I really hope it stays this way, sometimes places like this slowly decline in quality so I am reaching out to the Manager Rodney in this post - make sure to maintain your consistency, customer service & quality & you have a loyal family here! All the parents who attended told me this was the best party their child had been to & they all had a blast, adults included.

how in the WORLD does this place get a 5???  Like a good little planner, I called 30 minutes ahead of my intended pick up time, it was after all 1pm I thought maybe there'd be a lingering lunch crowd so I wanted to give them ample time. Arrived to an almost full parking lot so I thought wow I'm glad I called it in. well there are no rewards here for that! Upon entering, what seemed to be the assistant manager or at least the alpha of the cashiers told me to 'step aside over here' because I was a pick up. Then in the next moment she says oh actually go ahead & get in line. I look to my right & see a line of, not making this up, no less than 13 people. Excuse me??? I said, isn't this why you call in an order, to avoid this? to which she said "well we just want to make it fair". Whaaaattt????? oh i'm sorry i didn't know this was the USSR bread line version of pizza joints. maybe they should call this place Politically Correct Pizza, instead of Pino's Pizza. In economic times like these, you are just plain stupid if your company misses the customer service beat. I will NEVER go back to this place. Now, you're probably wondering, but what the pizza good? tasted like a rubbery triscuit & $23 for 2 truly small pizzas (smalls at other joints are not THIS small, geesh). their crust is absolutely horrible, it's a painful ripoff of cibo or bianco but doesn't even come close! what a trainwreck.....

This food was your basic yummy stick to your thighs delish variety. Halim, the owner, will treat you like a friend, is usually great with the stories and jokes, and is just a good guy. The hash browns are very unique and can be ordered in two varieties; sauteed and deep fried. Deep fried, they are almost more like chips, so I would stick to the previous. I heard they are getting a huge makeover, which will be great for these nice people. Solid diner food with oversized drinks, free refills and, apparently, occasional Mediterranean specials.

The Sanctuary is a boutique resort that definitely feels that way. You are given special attention and it does not come across in a corporate way, but in a genuine, authentic way. The staff are all AMAZING. I truly can't say one negative thing there. Raul the pool manager is on top of it & his attitude is reflected in the pool experience & the pool staff. Meg & Carl took care of us, both were phenomenal, Meg has such a sweet, attentive personality & literally checked on us constantly to make sure we were ok. It was a fairly busy Saturday, so that couldn't be easy to do. Carl gave us several great recommendations for food, which all turned out to be perfect selections. In general, his service was just awesome & again, great personality, positive. Dinner at Elements was very good I ordered the sashimi, hubby ordered the scallop special. Scallops were to die for! 2 negatives: the oysters on the half shell were just sad, they were puny & there were only 4. The dessert was just downright bad. It was 'panna cotta' but I'm sorry, my mother in law is from Italy & this was more like Chobani yogurt w/ the fruit compote. I am extremely picky about my desserts so someone else may very well have liked this. Breakfast in bed was so well appointed it was pretty perfect. The rooms are impeccable & they provide lots of perks, flip flops for the pool, luxurious toiletries etc. I have one request - I know many hotels don't do this but as a germ phobe could you maybe line the trash cans? I won't even go into why it's gross when they're not lined but you can figure it out. Anyway, other than some minimal things, you can see why this place is a celebrity favorite:)

Good God, finally! you can actually taste the fact that everything here is organic. That might sound strange, but you can. The salad was divine and perfectly dressed. Even the whipped cream on my pecan pie was scratch with a taste of vanilla and cinnamon. The bread served just barely before the meal was warm, soft & dense on the inside, crusty outside. this place is perfection and, not cheap, but we only go once a year, so there you go.

Get the orange chicken, like now. SO good. Other favorites: Moo Goo Gai Pan, House chow mein, amazing won ton soup, all the apps are delicious; crab puffs, egg rolls, all good. I think this is the only place in Phx that still serves those crispy won ton strips they call them 'chips'. They're like a $1, totally worth it, they go great w/ the soup or even just as a crunchy extra sprinkled on top of the moo goo gai pan. This is a family owned place and the same guy who I think is the father always delivers my food & he is so very kind & sweet. I hope this place never leaves, I have no idea where we'd get our Chinese food. It very much reminds me of one of my favorite Chinese takeout places when I lived in Orange County, CA as a kid....

Excellent yellow curry. Saw someone else ordered phad thai & it looked very nice. spring rolls were great, just the way they should be, good dipping sauce. Prices are very reasonable. very quiet & sufficient (though very small) restaurant, good for a casual date.

Big sigh...this walbarf is just so depressing & tonight was no exception. Let's just say CPS, OSHA, phx PD, ICE & DEA would have a field day here if they're low on quota. I always say I'm never going back but where else can I get pillows for 4 bucks, I know, my poor guests right? But definitely not clothes, wow, I glanced that way tonight & had an instant flashback to the sears outlet in downtown l.a. filled w/ cardboard bins of sad looking fashion mishaps. Maybe I'll try the christown location.....

oh dear, I hate to be mean, but I am from Southern California, and, when I see the cardboard boxes and the little red & white to go containers, I have high expectations people! The orange chicken tasted like doughnut batter and the sauce was just weird. the chow mein was not authentic, the meat had weird gravy sauce. I honestly have never had this type of Chinese food, sorry!

I am a low maintenance kinda gal & I have a knack for finding the goods on the cheap. So, while the prices on this menu weren't exactly Denny's, or even Macaroni Grill, for that matter, the experience and quality more than make up for it, thereby placing it in a category In Another Galaxy, Far Far Away. If you enjoy the corporate, droll, scary birthday singers of the former mentions, well then go there & save your 20%. That being said, sometimes you have to fork it over (ok a cheap shot at humor) to experience true cuisine.  Upon arriving at Tuck Shop at 6:30 on a Saturday night with no reservation, we were warmly greeted by what appeared to be the manager, not sure why I'm saying that, just a hunch. The construction of the restaurant was either a former house or reconstructed to look like one, complete with a family room filled with books, coffee tables & art to the side of the dining area. I don't know why a reviewer felt that this restaurant didn't offer privacy. There were several options of seating if you did not have the bigger parties occupying the large, banquet like seating in the middle. We were immediately addressed by our server, who went over the menu, took our drink order and brought them very quickly. We decided on the Spinach Salad with parmesan tuiles, caramelized prosciutto & shaved roasted sweet potato. I think there was some sort of light citrus dressing, amazing. The flavors were so complimentary and it tasted totally natural & unprocessed, yay. Then, we shared the bread with the roasted garlic, hmmmmm. Even the olive oil tasted high quality! Then, on to the Vodka cream sauce ravioli stuffed with cremini mushrooms & veal, wow. My girlfriend & I shared this all & it was perfect for us, though neither of us have very large appetites. However, we were STUFFED. I asked the bartender to add a shot of vodka to my "homemade" lemonade, which was perfect. The lemonade reminds me of the fresh not too sweet variety I used to get with my family on summer trips to Mexico.  I just couldn't order dessert but there really were only 2 selections. I think our server was Cray or Gray, something like that, he was awesome, so professional & very easygoing. Attentive to times we were in conversation as well, would just do what was needed & carry on, nice touch. Will definitely go w/ my hubby - that place is right up his alley! hope we get Cray, Gray, Clay???? again.........

The rides are fun but the reason i'm giving it 2 stars is because the reasons are very annoying to me - there is no, like, NO shade when you are in between rides or you want to sit down for a snack. second reason - I brought a little cooler with plenty of ice & water bottles. wanted to refill the waters at some point & there was seriously no water fountains to be had, so you had to refill waters in the bathroom eeeuuuwwh! I wasn't about to do that so obviously I had to break down & hit the snack bar - what a scam! it's like they gotcha where they want you. no thx

I have no idea why this location has three stars. While the location at Frank Lloyd Wright probably has a more impressive inventory due to their additional departments, this location is my favorite when it comes to the staff.  This is probably the only Walmart in Maricopa where I feel like I am not burdening them with my inquiries or need for assistance. As you get to know them by face they will acknowledge you and smile. Great manager who prioritizes customer service.

I really really wanted to love this place. Based on the culinary credentials alone, I should. I'll start with the positives then we'll move on, because, that's what Yelp's all about, right? And, you are entitled to completely ignore me anyway. Ok, so we ordered the Beef Red Chile entree & the Green Chile Pork, & Verde Salad. The salad was amazing. Crisp greens, chunks of avocado & healthy vine ripened tomatoes. There is no way you will find that goldmine of organice veggies at Tuli/Juli/Fili Berto's whatever the freak the name is. Cilantro Lime dressing: divine.   Red Chile Beef perfect. Flour tortillas - can I just slather these with some butter, add a glass of milk, & call it a day? Ok, here goes with the rest.  Green child pork - the texture of the pork literally melted in your mouth.   the sauce was good but it reminded me too much of Indian Curry & this is why - you guys Pleeeeez lay off the cumin.  Almost all of the food is just soaking in it. The beans taste like sweet barbecued cumin pods.  I'm guessing fans of truly authentic Mexican will not appreciate this. the rice was ok but, again, sorry, I'm used to my Tia's orange-y chicken broth-y moist Spanish rice & this is just too drastic of a departure. Even the chips; they remind me way too much of Frito Lay, not My Nana's. I suppose if you are looking for Mexican Cuisine or Mexican/Tex Mex, you will love this place. to the chefs; if that's not what you're aiming for, I hope you won't hate this post & instead, make some tweaks because this place has great potential. you are VERY close on the salsa, it could be a little spicier & it would be killer. The location is great, the interior is adorable & the staff extremely friendly.

Yes, we live in Laveen and 1. We are DESPERATE for some decent cuisine over here 2. HELP 3. WHY? 4. HELP. Anyway, I am not giving this place 5 stars because of any of the above.  if I was back in Orange County, oh sorry, the Oooo See, I would do the same thing. And, we even have Thrifty Ice Cream there. I mean, let's be real. The only real ace in the hold for Thrifty is that darn coveted chocolate malted crunch that seems impossible for anyone to recreate.   Scooptacular, however, has many many flavors that are great, and, maybe one day, they'll find a way to rival the chocolate malted crunch icon. The interior is adorable, with a cotton candy style color palette. There's even a Disney movie usually playing and some pretty decent seating. I was leveling off some of my ice cream, getting a bit greedy about getting down to my favorite part, the rim of the sugar cone meets the melted treat, yum. The manager came by & said oh is everything ok? & I said oh yes, I just have TOO much ice cream & I want my cone! if that's the worst complaint, well there you go.    I really hope everyone goes out & supports what is probably one of the best non-chain (ok let's be honest that's pretty much all we freaking have, APPLEBEE'S, ICK) places around.

This place is really adorable. We had originally gone to the sister restaurant for "pizza", which they didn't have. We're so glad, because, for the price, you really can't beat this place. The pizza is PERFECT, not too thin (I'm sorry my idea of pizza is not phyllo dough with some mozzarella splattered here and there) and not too thick (a moment on the lips, a lifetime on these freakin hips!). My husband is Italian & has grown up with an Italian mom making homemade pizza his whole life, he was very impressed. Quality mozzarella, homemade tomato sauce with the right amount of herbs. The Caesar salad was well done, the right amount of dressing, I could taste anchovies but not overwhelmingly so, and the lettuce was crisp & fresh. My only suggestion - add some garlicky croutons. This is the best part, though. If you have kids, there is a"VIP" room for them, complete with cartoons and video games, amazing! We sat & enjoyed our chianti while the little rugrats were engrossed in a show. You can't beat that precious bit of paradise.

I'm sorry I tried I tried like three times I really did and each time I went just ended up getting something for the kids because they have totally under developed taste buds. And let's be honest they're all about the toppings anyway. The yogurt quality is the issue for me and has like a slimy or jello look to it and the taste is just not creamy I understand it's very difficult to make something yummy when it's gluten-free nonfat or sugar-free  then have at least a few options that are none of those things. It's just incredibly subpar compared to Zo Yo

Ok, granted, since the new year, we've been on a super healthy kick, so you might think I'm just desperate for variety. Nope, we still enjoy tasty food at home, it's not all sprouts and flaxseed, geez. Attended Happy Hour at the Secret Garden on a Friday night, not overly crowded, but enough people to spark your interest and do some people watching. The grounds were impressive, I can see why they host weddings, reminds me of some of the local haunts in Laurel Canyon or Los Feliz, L.A. The hostess was very warm and talkative, we sat indoors as the patio was full.   Ordered the pulled pork (teehee) sliders and polenta sticks dipped in red pepper aioli. Drinks: Jack & Coke for $6 and the 'Desert Garden Breeze' martini for $6. My drink was amazing, it was a concoction of grapefruit, cranberry & vodka, wow, perfectly blended & still strong. The sliders were to die for, soft buns with buttered, crispy tops loaded w/ meat, caramelized onion & arugula. The polenta sticks were like savory churros, super crunchy crispy on the outside, soft cornbread inside, amazing flavor combined with the sliders. I was tempted to order the chocolate cake but I will have to see the reviews on that, I don't do desserts at restaurants unless they are worth a 55 minute Pilates dvd.

New Years Eve was perfect here. Fixed menu; $75 ea totally worth it. First course was amazing greens salad with candied figs, fresh farm cheese, sort of like a ricotta mixed with goat, hazelnuts, very light vinaigrette. Excellent. Gina, our server, always outstanding, suggested our drinks & they were divine. Mine was the Garden breeze martinia, fresh, citrus notes w/ orange Vodka. Second course was crab bisque soup oh yum! lumps of crab & shaved anise as the garnish with homemade focaccia, butter, rosemary. Third course was a sea bass served in parchment paper with a creamy fennel sauce served on the side, baby carrots. Fourth course was osso bucco, tender moist veal but honestly I was STUFFED by this point, I took most of it home for my foodie aspiring chef 8 yr old son. Dessert was absolute heaven on earth. A softer cheesecake, thanks to a hint of ricotta with a gingersnap moist crust, drizzlings of bittersweet chocolate & a mint cream sauce puddle. Wow. Ask for Gina, she is the best and you will not be disappointed with a top notch experience.

I wish I could remember the server he was so cute and his service was amazing, I CAN say it was Saturday, April 14th if that helps? Anyway, ordered the Cafe Omelette, perfection. Eggs fluffy and yellow not brown & flat. Server willingly brought a flute of diced fruit in place of potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit which was divine. My mom ordered the pecan french toast. Let me tell you, there is no way there is ANY place that makes better french toast, it was like a buttermilk donut dipped in crack, and with the fresh honey butter and syrup, heaven.   I really hope people of South Phoenix continue to support this place so it thrives and they can continue to serve us this amazing food because going to Applebees is just not in my wheelhouse. I'm excited to see their menu grow and incorporate seasonal items, which I'm sure they will execute beautifully. Even the bussers are phenomenally friendly. I really don't care about the 'cafeteria' feel of the dining room and I actually love the fact I get my drinks myself, I don't like it when servers fill my coffee cup to the brim and it gets cold before I finish anyway. Grove, may I suggest once/month dinner events, let that chef shine some more I'm sure he's capable!

Overall this place is OK if you want something really legit go to Thai basil in the Pv mall but this place is about convenience and I get that. My one biggest complaint is they have supposedly a cooked version of vegetables and a raw well the cooked is every bit as raw as the raw can you possibly cook them a little more not really into crunchy cooked vegetables

Do you want to go to a church that has an amazing children's ministry that your kids will actually look forward to attending every Sunday? Do you want to go to a church that has an authentic pastor who will challenge and inspire you? Finally my favorite part do you want to go to a church that feels like going to an unforgettable Christian concert every Sunday? After settling on this church we were very much welcomed in by the outreach staff and immediately plugged in. Best decision of our lives.

The food here is excellent I have had a chicken and vegetable curry for lunch and today we had that tikka  chicken. I would love to give it five stars but I don't know maybe I am ordering The wrong thing the only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because the prices are simply outrageous for what you get. When I get something to go Albeit I'm from Southern California where Indian restaurants abound but that usually includes rice and naan that is not the case here and that is so annoying! I spent $20 for one person today for lunch. Very classy inside the staff is very friendly I love that even the chef interacts with you but they've just got to do something about their pricing maybe reduce the portion sizes I don't know...okay update the owner himself sent me a message and said they would take a look at this & review now that's what I call customer service!

Being from orange county California the Mexican food here can be very different for me and sometimes that's not a good thing. But this place is an amazing perfect blend of what I call Baja Mexican and Arizona Mexican even something as simple as their rolled tacos here is absolutely amazing cooked just the way I remember growing up. I seriously think I ate like a full cup of salsa every time I come here the best I get the hottest one and grilled peppers on the side amazing

I have found my new favorite place. And based on my reviews you know that is not easy for me! An adorable little café nestled in the beautiful Cave Creek area on 60th St. and Carefree highway. Conveniently located right next to where I work out at the gorgeous Desert foothills ymca. Once inside you will think you are in Paris in a quaint little charming bistro. The sous chef who is part of the family who owns it took my order. I got the special of the day fresh made quiche with a mixed green salad, balsamic vinaigrette. The dressing was a perfect mix of sweet & tangy & was not too heavy just the right amount delicately sprinkled. The lettuce was crisp & fresh. The quiche crust seems to have a multi grain base which is great since I just got done with my workout and don't want to completely destroy it! The quiche egg was fluffy and cooked it the way it should be not underdone not overdone. Freshly grated Parmesan (not from a tin or even a package from a bar of real Parmesan ) complemented the top of the quiche and salad. And now for my favorite part which you might find a bit silly. I have yet to be Phoenix restaurant that serves freshly squeezed lemonade. In another review I criticize a very high-end Italian restaurant for serving my kids what was clearly Country Time lemonade. I mean I am even OK with serving the Simply Lemonade brand from Fry's. But nope this place is the real deal they squeeze their own lemons and add just the right amount of REAL sugar not sweet and low or whatever but it's very mild and it's just the right amount, served with finely crushed ice. So basically I just had one of the best meals I've had in probably a year. The rest of Phoenix you could learn a thing or two from this darling little bistro that is a foodie's paradise and I haven't even had one of their signature dessert bars yet, but I will....
