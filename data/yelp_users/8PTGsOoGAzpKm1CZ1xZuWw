I love Italian cuisine, so naturally my boyfriend chose Italian for Valentine's Day! Busy busy busy atmosphere in oldtown Scottsdale for this special day, we got excited walking up to the door seeing how beautiful the decor was at Marcellino's. Now both my boyfriend and I have each worked in the Scottsdale restaurant industry for over 5+ years, and working on Valentine's Day stinks for sure, so we get that everyone isn't really in their "best service moods" but that shouldn't be an acceptable out for not caring about all the people who are about to spend a good amount of money on their special night out at your restaurant! At least fake a smile, and make us think that you care about our experience. Our reservation was at 6:45- we were seated promptly, but the hostess was "blah"... Not a word left her mouth on the walk/seating to our table. About 30 seconds after being sat, a man offered us a bottle of still water to begin with, he was very polite, and I was disappointed to find out he was only the busser/serving assistant because his welcome was probably the best part of our whole meal. Waitress walks up, "Hello, what can I get you started to drink?" No name, no suggestions for a bottle of wine or champagne, oh well. We ordered two cocktails along with the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer to start. We were told that if we separated our order- aka start with the app, then our entrees are going to take a "very long time to arrive"... Um, okay, we are now feeling rushed and uncomfortable. Drinks come about 12 mins later, appetizer tasted like store bought cheese with a strip of prosciutto ($19.95 I believe, ugh?!), another "blah"... Entrees are ordered, the gnocchi (which was very good and full of flavor) and a seafood dish including some delicious frozen calamari... :/ Dessert and coffee were then offered, we figured it might be best to get a McDonald's ice cream cone on the way home and save the $14. As were waiting for the check to arrive, here comes my favorite server assistant again! He asked how our meals were, if he could clear our plates, etc. ALL while maintaining a smile. The only one I've seen all night. I wanted to give him a hug. All in all, $143 before gratuity for an average meal. No goodbye or thanks for coming in as we were leaving from the host stand/what looked to be a floor manager. We were pretty bummed with this whole experience. "Blah"

Top of the Rock is an upscale, enjoyable dining experience in the heart of Tempe. If you are looking for a restaurant to impress a date, family, friends, or anyone frankly, this is it. Open in the evenings, they offer an awesome happy hour menu that you can begin your meal with delicious handmade cocktails while watching the sunset over pretty much all of Tempe/downtown Phoenix. The decor has been given a modern spin on the beautiful interior this restaurant has to offer from when it was constructed. Gorgeous succulents to garnish the table along with candle-light, and hand made wooden plates with a delicate, but creative paper-style menu.  William was our server and he was fantastic. We felt welcome at TOR by all the staff, and had a great presentation of every dish that was brought out. William suggested we start out with the 'chicken and doughnuts' appetizer- homemade potato doughnuts on a jalapeño cream cheese with shredded chicken topped with a fresno chile caramel glaze... Holy cow was this plate AWESOME. Kudos to Chef Greg! The perfect savory + not too sweet start to our dinner.   For the second course, we had the heirloom tomato salad with local ingredients and a delicious feta cheese on top. Third, out of William's recommendations, I decided on the 35-day aged New York for my entrée, which arrived a perfect medium rare, and my boyfriend enjoyed their special of the evening- locally sourced tilapia with a beurre blanc and morel mushrooms. Incredible.  We finished with the homemade pineapple cheesecake and the manager, Carl, even stopped by to chat about our meal and make sure that everything was wonderful. I was so impressed with our whole dinner at Top of the Rock. You have a view that cannot be beat, an interesting, innovative menu that changes seasonally so you can always come back for more, and a staff that truly cares about you having the best experience possible. Thank you to William, Carl, and Chef Greg for a great evening! We will be back with many friends.

5 stars for the best clinic in Arizona! We love TSVC! 24/7 care for all types of fuzzy friends or even ones with scales and feathers! :) All the techs/staff are so friendly, and helpful the second you walk through the doors. My boyfriend and I have two shih tzu's that we have on TSVC's "gold plan" which is a monthly payment that takes care of all vaccines, neuters/spay, teeth cleaning, nail trimming, etc. Milo and Otis both have their tails wagging in the vets office even if their getting shots. The staff really knows how to comfort your little ones and make you feel in a safe environment. Thank you, TSVC, with providing us with a clinic that we can recommend to everyone and for always taking care of our sweet fur-babies!

Horrible horrible horrible. Every employee stands around and stares at you in a disgusting manner, they smell of cigarette smoke that reeks off of them is over-whelming and the young woman at the front desk could give less about what you have to say. They over-charged me for my simple wash and vacuum that I had asked for, I just wanted something basic- telling me it would be $62 dollars to clean my mats. After arguing with the staff about the ridiculous price, I still got nowhere, so I just walked out. Never again will I be back, and I hope that anyone who reads this review will let everyone know do not give this car wash your business. Very disappointing.

One of my favorite places to come to for any meal! Always consistent with great food. My boyfriend goes for the sushi, and I always tend to lean toward their panini's or mini burgers! The baskets, or "mini carts" of sweet potatoes are awesome. Matthew is a great server- knowledgable with the drinks and food menu, he took time to answers all of our questions even thought it was a little busy in the restaurant. Only reason I give 4 stars is due to the noise level, if you don't mind a little loud atmosphere, this is the place for you!

I like this location, a lot! The employees are always very accommodating in the store, and this location is always very clean and organized. My boyfriend and I have a 9 month old shih tzu- Otis, and we wanted to get a last minute groom in! Luckily they had an appointment open that evening, and we dropped Otis off with Sarah- she was SO nice and even asked us the specifics for his groom, (keep the length of the tail, do you want me to trim his eyelashes and ears, etc.) thank you, Sarah for the wonderful groom for our furbaby! A great definition of costumer service. :)

I love paradise, and I am truly sad to see most of them turning into Panera Breads around the valley, I don't believe the quality of food is as good when they switch over. This location is one of the only paradise name's left around me, and the past two times I've been in it's been  an unpleasant experience. Their employees are all high school age, and costumer service is horrible. Today is the last time I will go into this place even if it does turn into a Panera. ***If your costumer asks you to leave something off a sandwich due to an allergy, when it's only you and the costumer in the store... Leave the ingredient off the sandwich. Very simple.*** I'm glad I pay $10 for a sandwich where my bread was so stale it was crumbling in my hands and the person in front of me can't even simply listen to what I ordered correctly.

The best freaking glazed donut I've ever had in my whole entire life. Drive-thru is convenient, employees are helpful and nice! The location is a little bit out dated, but hey, usually hole-in-the-wall places are the best, and Bosa fits the part perfectly!

We LOVE Little Chicago pizza!!! My boyfriend and I live in the area, and this restaurant has the best pizza for takeout/delivery, hands down! Our favorite to order when we need some pizza/wings for a movie night at home. :) The plus is that they have awesome wings- their not 'rip off' little chicken wings, they've got the perfect amount of sauce, and are a good size. Friendly staff, tasty food, delivery time is usually 45 mins-1 hour, but it's worth the wait! Little Chicago is highly recommended!

Blanco has been one of my favorite Mexican inspired restaurants for as long as I can remember. I am absolutely obsessed with their queso and guacamole! You can't beat their happy hour either- most of their margaritas are on special and the starter trio of guacamole/queso/salsa is only $3!!! A note: this location also has my favorite tequila, Casamigos, on tap! Yum! Anywhoooo- this review is specifically about my lunch visit today. Two of us were promptly sat on the patio to enjoy the nice weather, and had the absolute pleasure of being served by Sergio! My guest loves their spicy salsa (doesn't usually come when they set down chips and salsa to start you off) and right after Sergio brought us our drinks, without even having to ask he brought out their mild green salsa AND the spicy habanero one for us to "try out" and enjoy! I was blown away simply because it was an extra gesture to go out of the way for our meal, and out of all the times I have dined at Blanco (about 700 times lol) no one has ever done this. After filling up on some chips, we decided we weren't super hungry, but each wanted to order about two tacos. Sergio told us this was possible because we were able to order ala carte, which again, no one had ever let me know before! (I've always just ordered the taco plates with three of the same tacos on it) I wanted flour tortillas- the other person I was dining with wanted corn. Sergio said it was no problem to do that! COOL. We both also got two sides along with our taco plates which was awesome that we didn't have to share only one order of their yummy rice! :) Overall this was the best service I have ever had at Blanco, out of either location I have been to (the Borgata/the Biltmore) and I am so appreciative of Sergio, his awesome attitude and his timely catering to us to make our experience so wonderful. The next time I come in (probably in a few days- I can't get enough) I will be asking for Sergio to take care of me again. ¡Muchas Gracias, Sergio! :)

Herbal Nails is hands down one of the best nail salons I have chosen to bring my business to. Simply because they cater to an awful allergy I have to acrylic/gel nails. I am a slight nail biter, so I have always had fake tips to ignore the habit, about two years ago I developed an allergy to whenever/wherever/no matter what I tried (no cuticle oil/no primer/no fake tips) my nail beds would break out with an itchy rash that would barely let me sleep at night, until I had ripped my new full sets off. I was devastated and just stopped getting my nails done- therefore always being a bit self conscious about my hands! My friends mother is a regular at Herbal Nails and told me about this new product called SNS- it is a natural nail gel/powder alternative that gives you the same exact look as acrylics- without the harsh damage to your nail! Acrylic bonds to your nail bed, which is where I developed the allergy, all the primer that I had been putting on through the years had taken all the natural oil out of my nails, where as SNS is already pre-bonded with natural ingredients! So it doesn't hook to your actual nail and depend on that to stick on. There is no UV lights to wait for, it's a simple instant dry! I'm telling you, I didn't think other people had this allergy, but after reading up on it I found many similar cases and I'm glad I have finally found the alternative with NO swelling or itching what-so-ever!!! It is a little more of a price for the SNS- but if I feel comfortable with my nails and my hands I am willing to pay!!! Also a note: this is the ONLY salon that I know of in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area who uses the SNS product! GO SEE KATIE! She is so sweet and I believe she is an owner of the salon as well. She takes cares of me about every three weeks and always remembers our stories right where we left off. I hope this review is useful for anyone who possibly has an allergy- go try SNS at Herbal Nails!
