The last two times have been less than enjoyable. First there was a problem with the kitchen and they could only make sushi and that was fine. Tonight there was an emergency and they didn't have a cook, so it was sushi only again. The person making sushi was taking pictures with his phone while wearing gloves, and would go back to touching the food. It's a cool place to drink, but I won't eat there again.
