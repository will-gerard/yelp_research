OMG!!  So this place is under new owners and this place SUCKS now!!  Ever since the new owners bought it this place has gone to HELL!  The food is frozen and not freshly cooked like it used to be.  We used to go here for $2 breakfast every Sat and Sun morning.  Our favorite bartender Tim is gone and our favorite cook is gone and our favorite waitress is gone and this place just sucks egg shells now!!  The owner thinks he can cook, so what does he do??? He puts the cook out on the floor to be a server!! WTH?!?  So bad for business.  Truly wish the previous owners would come back.

I really enjoy myself here!  Lady J is the bomb diggity (wow can't remember the last time I used that phrase).  Every time we go there we truly have a good time.  It's very difficult to sit in your seats...Lady J gets your body movin', booty shakin' and the arms wavin'! Now with that said, I will say that I am not too fond of the drummer who thinks he can sing!  Dear Drummer of the Lady J band, I was there a few weeks ago and this particular Saturday night you wanted to sing.  You messed up my groove! Please do not sing any more...that's all I want for Christmas!

I love, love, love the House Fried Rice here.  They do not skimp on the nice size shrimp, the biggest I've seen in fried rice anywhere around here.  A healthy portion of chicken, beef and pork as well in the rice. The House Fried Rice is like $10...they raised the priced a couple of years ago.  If they raise the price any more I will have to go find some good competition.  Another favorite of mine was the Hot Sizzling Rice soup...very good.  The soup portion is huge! When they brought out that big kettle of a server bowl I was like wow! I've never done delivery as I live extremely close.  I love the atmosphere inside.  It's a great date place. It's a lot smaller than there original location downtown...However I'm not complaining because it's around the corner from me now! YAY!  I wouldn't bring small children.  The place is small and any screaming kids would definitely be heard throughout.

Yesterday I wanted something refreshing, light, healthy and quick to eat. So I decided to stop by The Wildflower Bread Company. I'm so glad I did!   The food was very delicious and what I ordered was perfect! This is way better than the typical fast food joint. I order a half Almond Tuna sandwich and a side wildflower salad. I got my food in under 10 minutes and I went around 2pm so it wasn't that busy. I can just imagine what the lunch hour is like...this place is awesome!   They also have an impressive dinner menu. I had no idea! And it's very affordable.   The service was great and the atmosphere is very easygoing and comfortable. I ordered my food to go and the person that waited on me offered me a glass of water! Very nice touch.   I will be coming here on a regular basis. I just wish I was a visitor to this restaurant a lot sooner than yesterday!

I have honestly never had a bad experience here.  The wings are the best...lil secret...request to have them put on the grill to make them a lil extra crispy!  The fries are so crispy, crunchy and hot!  Had the opportunity to enjoy the Bloody Mary bar where you fix up your own with all the fixins'.  You basically get a glass with your choice of poison and you fix it up with the juice, hot sauce, pickles, peppers, etc.  The servers are awesome!  Never have to wait for anything.  They are on top of it there.  It appears they enjoy their job and you can tell by their service.  Man wish I would've gotten up earlier and went and got me some honey bbq wings!!  Well let's see it's 230am now...9 hours from now I can have me some of those wings!!  Ok...go to sleep wake up and go eat wings! That's the agenda for tomorrow!  Price is moderate that's if you drink beer and the time of day you go because of specials.

I came here for lunch and ordered a salad with steak on it.  The steak was blah and there was hardley any of it on the salad.  I took two bites and couldn't eat anymore.  So I ordered the chicken cesear salad...that was the most bland salad I've ever had. You know how there's supposed to be that slight twang of lemon there was none.  The chicken was so bland and chewy it was very difficult to eat.  There was no seasoning on the chicken whatsoever.  I'm thinking it was some left over chicken from somewhere.  Needless to say I left there hungry.    My lesson learned...when you go to a bar, order bar food.  You should have better luck with the wings.

I love Zoya! She does a phenomenal pedicure and eyebrow wax. I never have to wait. It is very professional there. The decor is beautiful and I always relax when I'm there. Zoya told me today that she does Swedish massages at their sister salon which is right across the way in the same parking lot. They have a hair salon in the other location as well.   I have been going there for a while for the Happy Feet pedicure. Best exfoliation, great neck massage and paraffin wax for the feet.   Ahhhhh...my feet are so happy right now!

Mmmmm Good, Mmmmm Good...Yummy...Yummy...Yummy for my Tummy...Tummy...Tummy...   I just wish I would've known about this place a lot sooner! I'm almost frustrated that I literally live right down the street and never heard about it! I'm almost pissed because now I'm moving to Ahwatukee!!! Go fricken figure!   I love every bit of my 1 pound of Stacy Style Rib Tips and 1 slab of Beef BBQ Ribs, Cornbread, Mac&Cheese and Red Beans and Rice! Ok I didn't eat all of that by myself...but I sure did try! Their ribs are meaty just the way I like it and the sauce is perfect!  I was sadly disappointed though that they ran out of the red velvet cake!!!! However, this is the perfect excuse to get my butt back there!   My BF's name is Stacy...I wonder if we can get a Stacy discount?!?!?!?    Oh yeah and like everybody else said...BRING CASH!  I do believe I did see an ATM there!

Giving 1 star is truly being generous.  If you want real BBQ, please try Shane's Rib Shack, Stacy's Smokehouse, Famous Daves, Bobby Qs, hell try my boyfriend's BBQ.  I'm sorry to be so blunt.  I'm thinking the people that frequent this place has never had real BBQ or there aren't that many options in North Scottsdale.

Where do I begin??  Let's start with the basics...this place is spic and span clean!  It's so clean in here I bet you could eat off the floor.  Even the cooking area is spic and span clean...how do you guys do that?  It's quite impressive and thanks for being so clean.  I just can't eat in a dirty restaurant and you guys are unbelievably clean.  My big sis has been ranting and raving about this place for a minute.  I understood her excitement as she was fortunate to grow up around the cultural melting pot in Chicago. I remember when growing up and heading on over to Chicago to visit my Aunts and Uncles and many, many cousins.  A highlight of our frequent trips was going to get an Italian Beef, polish, Chicago dog, pork chop sandwiches, etc.  Well yesterday I experienced one of those favorite tastes of mine from the Windy City and that was the Italian Beef and quite honestly...I either needed someone to pinch me or slap me because I thought I was in Chicago...right here on a very near corner of McClintock and Southern.    Upon my first bite into that juicy ass damn tender sandwich...I admit I drooled on myself...lol.  First bite instantly shot me back to Chicago.  How do you get your meat so damn tender and juicy?? lol I got the hot peppers on mine and a side of fries with the special sauce (love the sauce btw).  So I'm thinking I may develop a habit or some form of addiction so I'm informing you early on...to please be consistent with your Italian beefs because I will become a regular.

So am I the only person that watches Man vs. Food?  Well if you watch that show then you'll know what I mean when I say...OH MY GOODNESS...OH MY GOODNESS!!! OH MY FRICKEN GOODNESS!  This is the best burger I've eaten in the state of Arizona over the past 12 years!  I tried to understand what I was feeling when I took my first bite so I could describe it to you...you know how Man vs. Food does it?    All I can say is, it was JUICY, FLAVORFUL, EXTREMELY DELICIOUS and HUGE!  I just got the 2 patty!  Oh I can't forget the fries!! THE BEST FRIES EVER! If you don't believe me then go check it out for yourself!  This place can become very addicting.  It taste like a homemade grilled burger but 50 times better!!!    All I gotta say is In and Out, Fat Burger need to pack up their stores and get the hell outta town!  I done found my new burger joint!

It's well long over due that I write a review about this place.  I visit this place several times throughout the week and on the weekends well I'm there every day.  When I first started going here I was just making a pit stop and grabbing a drink.  Now when I go I hang out for a bit, grab a drink and some food...not to mention my two a days when I go twice in one day (translation for those that need it).  Now let me get back to the food.  It's really difficult to call this bar food because it is so damn good.  I stop by for lunch, dinner, take out, whatever just try the Philly Cheese Steak (get it with Cheese Whiz) or the Ribeye Steak Sandwich, better yet the Chicken Sandwich with the swiss and mushrooms, heck get some wings while you're at it because those wings are big and juicy. Quite honestly you can blindly choose any item on that menu and I bet you that you will love it.  I gotta tell you, this place is a cool spot to hang out whether you ride a motorcycle or not, this place is a great place for great food you just can't go wrong.  The ingredients are fresh and there is a REAL cook in the kitchen.  Not someone just unwrapping food and throwing it on the grill or in the fryer.  This person has cooking skills. The chicken is seasoned to perfection and it's juicy...juicy chicken is very important in my book.  I went there the other night for pickup and there was a couple with the same thing in mind as myself as they left out of there with 4 big takeout containers of FOOD.  And it's reasonably priced!  Ok enough ranting about the food it's making me hungry and it's only 10:47am.  The bartenders are fricken awesome!  The owners are cool as hell.  The patrons are cool laid back folks (usually bikers and some non-bikers sprinkled in) but don't let that keep you from going there.  The inside is really nice and clean, the outdoor patio is covered and spacious with televisions everywhere.  There's live music here as well.  This is the best thing about moving to this side of town for me. Good food, good prices, good people...what more can you ask for??
