First review but not the first time here.  Originally came here because well I did enjoy the Van Buren location.  On a day that well, I wanted Quantity over Quality.... A point I will explore soon.  Upon entering I had already referenced the other reviews of this location. Seemed about average so naturally i prepared myself to not be impressed.  First things first.  The place was a bit of a mess (being gracious with my language). I understand it was at the end of their lunch rush but still... if your a staple of any city your image is very important so Tidy Up! Also there is nothing wrong with the idea of a remodel in certain areas like the bathroom and table area.   *I almost always suggest an open kitchen for any eating establishment. I mean who wouldn't enjoy seeing my meats being cooked and smoked as I am contemplating my order at the register? right?  Price... a bit overpriced for the QUALITY I received and even the QUANTITY was not what I expected for what I paid.  Ordered the Pork sandwich meal with Sweet potato fries. Pork was dry and burnt, flavorless too, which I'm sure is easy to get away with since anyone who is in there usually sloshes their sandwiches in that BBQ sauce... not good enough for me or most foodies I'm sure. The fries where and had been frozen obviously, ughh.... like really? and to top it off they were also bland (doused them in BBQ sauce just like my sandwich to try to save them)  My girlfriend and her mom had ordered the same thing. but with different sides. Her Mac n Cheese looked awfully fast food/michelina's of them. Also to top it off after being home for about an hour or so and even through the rest of the evening me and m'lady felt awfully sick (Not a surprise considering if you take a gander into the kitchen from the soda fountain it looks like quite a mess back there....)  I will not be visiting again on my own account but also some people I lunch with are stuck in their ways. Id like to see a remodel, food quality improved to reflect proper pricing, CLEANLINESS (not just at my table when i have to clean it myself but in the KITCHEN) and well all those smiles people are saying they do not see there will come to the employees naturally. I see some obvious pride lost in the owners and employees alike.  I never like to see a business fail. Especially one that has such a familiar name her in Phoenix. Best of luck to you guys.

Just popped my Cherryblossom tonight... what a treat.  Was greeted and seated promptly. Hostess had a side pony. Hip as ef. Sat down and met our server as he brought waters to the table. solid.  Place felt a bit crowded but still cozy and sexy like my favorite onesie...  The spicy Korean beef plate was littered with beef. So good it made it on my shirt as well... than was taken to mouth sex Ramen cove with a big bowl of the TanTan-men... lots of heat in my body was producing at an almost swampy rate and maintained till the last drop.  Only thing i see that can improve is knock down that silly wall that divides the two different rooms for seating (more viewable space will make it seem less crowded i promise). Also unless your a Village inn or a bakery you shouldn't have a dessert display? hope that is not just me thinking that. A bit cheesy and the servers I'm sure would love the extra room for service purposes. Maybe a new expo window??  Will be back soon. Like tomorrow.

Rode in for a lunch on my bike pretty hungry for Greek food.  The music there was a bit much for my migraine that day and almost wanted to leave but I needed sustenance so i sat there looking about the menu and decided to start with the Hummus (Hot)*  Was a fan but I feel as if the chili powder they sprinkled it on top could have maybe been mixed into the batch of delicious Hummus itself?? was still delicious.  I had gotten the Gyro Kisra and man it was.............. Rad. You just have to try it.  Chicken curry plate my friend got was pretty bland. Did not compare really to the almost same exactly curry plate I had made at home the night before.  Our server: was chewing food as he walked up to greet Us. Ew... Also did not give a hint of urgency when he has spilled water all over my side of the table. Our encounters with him were minimal and short. Kinda annoying since it seemed to be a quieter lunch as he had no other tables? Bad impression left for sure.  I did though really like what I saw on the menu and even had a hard time making a decision on my entree so I will definitely be back! Different server hopefully.

So it t'was valentines day and I decided last second that me and my date should go there for Vday dinner.  I personally have only had drinks there while my date had been some time before and actually had the food. She had said it was not that bad and since we were both pretty laid back considering the holiday I was not setting myself up for anything amazing.  We walked in maybe at the end of the dinner rush and found two seats at the bar quickly. A small bar space but intimate I guess. Greeted promptly by our bartender and bar-back with smiles and served my wine with a small recommendation based on what I like.  A good start so far.  Having just got done from teaching yoga my date wanted simple. "Cheese flat bread please, to start" i asked the bartender, Once finished consuming our starting plate i was neither impressed or disappointed. I mean who can really mess up a cheese pizza?? I do appreciate lots of basil and garlic though if the pizza is to be without any other special toppings. Anyways, still enjoyed it very much.  We ordered than the pot roast for our shared entree. I thoroughly enjoyed it but found the meat a bit cold on the bottom???? nothing worth sending it back since the rest of the plate was delicious but how was it any bit cool when it arrived so quickly? sort of a mystery to me.  Overall our dinner was short and we had a good experience. I would only say that a almost $20 plate should come out steaming hot. That is all. Service was top notch and I will definitely be back sooner than later :).  BTW their baker comes in after hours to make all of their bread. that is amazing and good luck finding that in most any other establishment.

-Never been but will now frequent. -Service was the best I've had in a while (the server specifically)! -Cajun burger was delicious even though was a bit to medium than what i prefer -Pork Taco was also fancied much -That Mac and cheese tho... could taste wayyyy too much butter... would not recommend*... seriously too much butter.  I have only one weird irrational complaint.... straws were too bright and made my head hurt?..... :/. Also was a pretty sunny day and forget my eye shields.

Just got back from dinner so this is fresh as can be.  I will make this review quick and simple  Bartending rocked. Even though it was super busy she made time to make sure we were being taken care of (good job Claire!).  The Porkwich was sexy and delish. I neverrrrrrrrrrrr like coleslaw but dang... perfect combo with the combined ingredients of my entree.  Pork belly corndogs... highly recommended for a bar snack!  Soup of the day was chicken tortilla... Love the heat in the soup but Salad portion could have been a bit more balanced with the soup but maybe that is asking a bit much for $10? Still enjoyed thoroughly! Also why the massive crouton? lol....  Go there if you haven't, definitely my favorite upward projects restaurant for sure! (maybe a close tie with postino)  Amazing vibe and architecture to add***

Was out and about this last Saturday with some pals of mine on a bike ride and decided to stop in.  Would have to say I have truly enjoyed ever visit I have had there (always sat at the bar).  Never had a complaint about service. This last time though we took a table outside since the weather was too nice not to take advantage of of the one table that happened to open up outside. Felt lucky considering it seemed to be pretty busy at the time.  We were greeted by our server promptly and provided with water just as quick.  we requested some sample tastings of a few brews and per usual I always appreciate their diligence in offering for us to taste our beer selections before we had them.  Than onto our food orders.  Having a full lunch just before our ride I had decided to stick to my 1 beer for the time we were there. My friends needed food and ordered the wild BLT (Alligator) and some pretzels. I am an avid fan of this place so I made a point to try their plates.  The alligator brat was amazing. would only suggest that it be in a bun rather than a wrap??? wraps seem to better accommodate meats that area cut or sliced. Just my opinion.   The pretzels were great! I am always astounded when I go out to eat and a restaurant cannot gets pretzels and cheese right?? I know I am not the only one thinking this. The portion size was generous so no complaints there either. the ketchup is made in house = Awesome. Can get some real flavors out of it rather than vinegar and sugar.  I only have to knock this review down a star since this time being sat outside I did see a bit of a lag in service times between our food order and drink refills. Nothing we felt we needed to complain about since we were in no rush that evening but I did notice a few tables scanning the floor for their server more than a few times.  side note: last time I had visited the bar was with my roommate and having showed up to an empty restaurant mid day we expected prompt service but were quickly derailed by a bar crawl that came in filling the floor from shoulder to shoulder and taking priority over our service. Was a bit annoyed but again was in no huge rush. but still, Priorities!!  Love the place and the brew selections! ill be visiting again no doubt!

This is for all my fast food spicy chicken sandwich connoisseurs  When purchasing spicy chickens your committing to such a delicious food coma and salty bloated haze followed with a gross nap because you just endured a forgot to chew your food face stuffing. Opposite of anything cute or decent.  (Always order 2)  Wendy's was a strong contender until consistency of the sandwich leaned towards more bread than meat. Weak. Time to move on. Be smart.  A guilty pleasure of mine. Will be a tough habit to break... will i ever?... (to be continued)...

Have been to Cornish many times between the Mesa, Tempe and Scottsdale location and all I have to say is that this place is all types of mouth sex.   The bottle and draft selection is always exciting. I have neglected to try anything from the cocktail list yet but that does not mean I am not avoiding it by any means! The food is amazing and alike I'm sure the cocktails are too!   A few favorites: Curried potatoes... amazing The Pilgram... omg your saying i can have thanksgiving whenever I want?? The Lamb Vindaloo... prepare for some heavy breathing from the heat. so. worth. it.  The layout of this place is very comfortable. Along with what I call comfort food the staff and the environment really pulls it together.  A must to visit if your a new resident to PHX, traveling through or you just live here. I promise it wont be your last time back.
