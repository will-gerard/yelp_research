I'm going to keep this review very short and sweet because until yesterday, I never really felt compelled to yell from the rooftops about Zoe's meals. Especially for my fellow vegetarians.  But the tides have changed, my friends. Yesterday, because they are close to work and I was starving, I decided to hit up Zoes for the only thing I ever really eat there - the Grilled Pimento cheese on rye which I highly recommend! Sometimes the cheese doesnt melt right and its lumpy but the flavor is divine. No boring grill cheese there. The rye adds a lovely added dimension of grilled-cheesiness.  Now for the new, sexier menu, there are a few more veg options.   I had the hummus and salad plate and I was so surprised at the awesome flavor. The hummus was as good as my homemade hummus and the salad is very well done with real lettuce (no nutritionless iceburg here) and fresh veggies and of course, the requisite Zoe's feta cheese. The cucumber Raita was just the right touch.   Soooooo tasty!  Now I'm not a fan of any of their sides, till now. The Braised white beans are a dream. I dont know what spices they used (ginger maybe?) but I couldnt believe my tastebuds. So proud of Zoe's.  Two notable changes:  1)There is now a separate charge to grill the Pimento cheese sandwich (10 cents - really????) in addition to the 22 cent price hike.  2) Chips no longer come with the sandwiches but are an extra 65 cents. (cheaper than the vending machine at work still)  Either way, I'm compelled now to patronize this little spot more often. Next time I'm trying the new spinach wraps...mmmm

Let me preface this review by saying that I MAY try this office again just with a different doctor. Dr. Drewitz  (and a few others) got pretty awesome reviews elsewhere online and was a peer-voted TOP DOC in the Phoenix Magazine. While that's not the patients voting, Yelpers, I suggest you do your own research.   Note: I will update my review if I need to go back.  Now to my experience. I called with digestive stress thinking it was a pretty serious episode that I was having. They got me in quickly but with a young doctor that hadn't received very good online reviews. They were quick to assign this one to me and although i was leery, I decided to just give this guy the benefit of the doubt.  As another Yelper just before me mentioned, although I don't know if we had the same doc, the bedside manner was virtually non-existent. While he may just have a laid back personality, professionally, I prefer my docs to act like they give a shit.  So then after asking me a few perfunctory questions about my current symptoms, he does the "stethoscope to the heart and back" routine and sends me to a kind woman to schedule my CT scan at a local Imaging place. Again, they got me in pretty quickly.  Here's where it went awry for me. I went in for the scan on a Friday and the CT techs said the drs. office would receive results in 2 to 3 bus. days. I called Digestive Health Center - Coronado in 4. They had the results but the dr. had to sign off so someone could tell me my results and hadn't. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to panic cause NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS when you're a patient with a condition.  EIGHT BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I call back like WTF? The assistant was apologetic but noted he STILL hadn't signed off on my results. Now remember , that this is simply so they can tell me something IS or ISNT wrong with me. Jeez!!!!!  So I said I need another doctor then. An hour or two later another doctor calls back to tell me all is fine. For this frustrating episode, I receive a dang near $200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying $350 out of pocket for a CT scan. So $550 of my hard-earned- and- not- easily- come- by savings later, I am ok but seriously do not feel the service I received was worth it!

Chile, please. You call that Barbeque??? (SNORT)  And they definitely AINT soul food. They are in a misplaced category. Take it from a soul sista with a southern mama, unh uh...  It was probably back  in 2001  the first and only time I ate there. I couldn't even finish my bbq pork sandwich, I was that disappointed.  For those who hail from states to the East of  Arizona, you'll know just what I mean. Sorry, Honey Bears. Just keeping it real!

I am in love with Bikram yoga now.  I'm not much of a routine person or exerciser but i can work with this.  Before you go, HYDRATE, HYDRATE, HYDRATE! When I didn't, I definitely felt it and not only almost fainted in class several times but had a nasty headache following the class all day!!!!  Bikram is a series of 26 asanas (postures) in a 104 degree room. Some days feel a little warmer than others. Not sure if that's me or the room temps.  I suggest reading Bikram Chouhoury's book (got it from the phx library) to study the postures and get great tips if you're concerned about whether you're doing them right as its not common to receive personal corrections during class.  I love that they have early morning hours. The 6 am class is a goddess-send when I have to work 10 hour shifts.   There is a script Bikram has his instructors say for the most part. That kind of gets monotonous but some change it up and keep it funny and interesting.  Bathrooms, shower and dressing room are clean.  If you forget your water or dont have a mat, you can rent/buy here but don't forget to bring a long towel to lie over your mat and a hand towel to dab all that sweat your gonna be drippin'.  A.M. Instructors are friendly and cool, especially Sabre. Love her! (can't speak for the others because I only go in the mornings)  If you commit for a year with autopay, you get an awesome unadvertised price of $100/month unlimited. Totally worth every penny and then some.   Downsides at this studio:  * Not sure the carpet is cleaned often enough. The smell of feet and mold can be distracting and a turn off during practice. (UPDATE: May 2011 - Carpet is no longer stinky so they must have increased the cleanings. Thank you. Makes all the difference, guys)  * One shower stall for how many girls?  *Website is unimpressive and could use revamping to reflect all of the instructors bios and specials offered.    *There is no option to pay online. To auto pay monthly, one of the instructors inputs my card info manually each time. I trust him, but its just not secure enough for my tastes.  * No store in studio to purchase special hot yoga clothing and accessories.  *What, no Twitter or FB page?  * People who do not use deodorant and other personal body odors. YUCK!  That may look like a lot of downsides but I Love this place and the new friends I have met and have committed to an annual practice.   Do this yoga and grow into the poses at your own pace, pushing yourself to your own personal limits and you will be rewarded greatly for your resolve!

Best ribs ($30) that I've had in Phoenix thus far, hands down. It's even better than Bobby Q's (much less fat on the Hillstone ones). The french fries and coleslaw that come with it are of equal quality and bursting with flavor.  Loooooove!

FYI: I just passed this place Saturday, May 15, 2010 and it is now a LOVING HUT chain restaurant.  I used to looooooooooove the Vegetarian House's Lemongrass chicken. Salty but absolutely hard to tell it wasn't meat. Great stuff. Hopefully, they don't change the recipe but I'm guessing they will.

Wow, I'm going to have to show this to my friend who thought I was "being too picky" when in essence, he obviously  has some simple ass taste buds.  It started out wonderfully. The sun was about 1/2 hour from setting and casting that orange glow that Phoenix does so well. We went there for the ambiance. I offered to treat. Little did I know, I was in for a treat and it sure as hell wasn't a good one.  So we get Kathy (I think that was this crappy waitress' name).  She takes my friend's drink order and I'm still deciding and she just walks away. No "I'll be back" or anything customer service-y like that. Then she comes back and takes my drink order. Fine.  She suggests the Pork chops and even though I eat 90% vegetarian, I go with her suggestion. Cause the alternative is one boring salad choice.  It comes back pink and rubbery. What the--?I don't give a crap what anyone says, pork ain't supposed to be pink. That  means it ain't cooked and I ain't eating it. So I send it back and it comes back clearly microwaved for a few seconds and guess what? Still freakin' pink on the inside.  Lovely! So this girl asks if I want to try the  Chilean Sea Bass. Ok, now I've had too much alcohol and I'm not thinking properly cause that shit's endangered - - very politically incorrect but I'm near my boiling point  so I  agree and think surely something's getting spit in or on.  Well, she brings out beers stating that "he bought you  2 beers for the trouble". Huh? He who? The waiter? The manager? And she damn near slams them on the table. Now I'm about to ghetto but my friend just casts me a look that puts me in check.  So the sea bass finally comes and you are seriously not going to believe this-----it was pink and pretty much undercooked. And of course, I had her take it back and then it came back flaky. I ate a few forkfuls but was pretty much frickin done at that point and now burdened with a 3-beer buzz within 1.5 hours. Not good.  That's why they put the restaurant on top of those damn rocks so you'll be distracted away from the crappy service, mediocre food, ignorant help, and gouging prices. There is no way that food is worth what they charge. And I agree 100% with the other reviewer that I could have made that shit at home. Cooked thoroughly and a helluva lot tastier and I didnt go to culinary school.  There's so much more to bitch about people but I'll stop right here or you'll be scrolling down forever. I apologize for all the cussing. I don't normally in my reviews cause I think it's tacky. But this review could not have been true to itself without these appropriate words.  I can't believe I tipped that jerk. What the heck was I thinking. One star and that's only for the view.   DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE FOOD! DRINKS MAYBE SO YOU CAN GET THE VIEW BUT THATS IT!

Yummy Yum Yummers! Great place for a burger! I'm never disappointed it.   Awww, man and you totally have to try the fried mushrooms. Bad for your cholesterol but good for that "happy place" in your belly.  I agree that the condiment bar is always fresh and kicks butt. Bonus: It comes with a sneeze guard for germ-o-phobes like moi!  And as long as this place exists, it makes it hella hard for a sista to go Vegetarian.  Hint: As with every place in the "uptown-ish" area, go early or late if it's lunchtime to get a parking spot or you'll be circling that little parking lot for several minutes.

I highly recommend this business for piercing. The jewelry collection is pretty extensive and the location is in a very convenient uptown location. The place was clean.  My piercing was a surprise Christmas gift and I did not know about it up until the moment my Love and i pulled up to the shop. We were greeted immediately upon entering which is excellent customer service. It says "I see you and appreciate your being here". Then, it took a turn toward the negative. After a few questions/answers, the front desk chick began to display impatience and attitude which instantly turned me off and shut me down lest I say some stuff I can't take back. That's all the space that rant will get.  Upon meeting and discussing my desires with the lovely and stunning, Ana, my experience was significantly heightened back to the positive feelings that I'd had upon entering. She listened to what I wanted, offered her professional opinion and went to prepare for our piercings.  She is patient, funny, and just an overall pleasure to interact with. She made us feel comfortable and talked us through the process. My septum piercing barely registered any pain, not that that was a real concern for me. My Love's ear stretching was low pain, as well. This lady's got skill and precision and 18 years of experience. It's not cheap (our grand total was $170  for 3 piercings plus cost of wound cleaner ($26)), but I don't think you'd want to skimp when it comes to body enhancement. Save your pennies and do something nice for yourself.  I will definitely seek her out for piercings and recommend her in the future.

1st, Dr. Bonnin is located in PV Costco at 4570 E. Cactus Rd. Phoenix. Behind PV mall.  Noelle (ofc. mgr.) was very patient and helpful because I hadn't checked to see if they were covered (they do not accept insurance). She called and sat through what I consider to be a tedious automated phone system with my insurance and confirmed that I would be reimbursed minus a tiny out of pocket amount.  The pre-exam lady (will find out her name and update) was pleasant and efficient.  Dr. Bonnin was funny, patient, great active listener, and informative. I learned things I didn't know about eye strain, etc.  Hint for those who are on the computer like me more hours than I am not: How you hold your book (lower than eye level) is the most comfortable position for our eye's focus. So if you can adjust your monitors to be below you, do it!   Highly recommend this office for a great customer experience and low prices. Even if I wasn't covered, their prices are highly reasonable and I'd still come here. Do an internet search of his name to find out more.

While waiting to get a tattoo at Lucky Draw, the boys in the shop said they were ordering from here and asked if I wanted to go in on it. Sure, I said, not expecting anything spectacular but needing sustenance for the 3+ hour tattoo I was about to get.   What a surprise! I'm judging on the one meal that I had but Holy Sheep the Veggie Pita is to die for, Veg lovers!  The veggies tasted fresh and yummy and not all mushy. The red sauce, I'm not sure what it is but will have to find out, was so dang flavorable.   The flavor? Amazing. My taste buds were ecstatic.  If they can make a near-vegetarian girl happy and they're not even a vegetarian restaurant, I imagine the omnivores will make out like bandits here as well. New fan for life and very glad there is actually another decent veg-friendly restaurant on the West Siiii----eed!!!  UPDATE: The next time I went, it was just like a curry sauce, no red sauce. Huh? Not as tasty

Definitely coming back. Located in a part of Old Town Scottsdale that I don't frequent myself. Well now I have a reason to. Friendly customer service! I ordered the Crispy basil chicken which was a little too sweet for my tastes but still very good on a bed of crispy basil. The small was more than enough for me. Almost too much. I asked for medium and I really didn't get much spice. I'm kind of wimpy with spices but next time I will ask for "hot".  Oh what am I saying? Cause the next time I'm ordering the crispy teriyaki chicken. My Love had the Crispy Teriyaki chicken. It was waaaayyyyyyy better, IMO. So like I know most guys hate it when women do this but I ended up eating more of his than my own. Sorry, babe!!!! But it had pineapples and other goodies in there. The flavor was crazy good.  I brought the Spinach Pot appetizer home for my BFF. He loved it! He's vegan. He said the sauces were outta this world. Vegan potstickers with tofu and spinach in them and garlic on top....mmmmm, I'll try that next time.  One weird thing is that I only saw 1 bathroom stall for each gender. That couldn't be right, could it? What happens when that place is packed and people drink lots of alcohol and water while there?  Well and another thing was that rice and noodles were to be ordered as sides. While this is a good idea if you need a choice (for instance, I can't eat rice. My tummy won't digest it correctly). I'm just not used to those being extras.   Anyway, you should totally eat here if you enjoy thai food.

I love this place and I'm not even Vegan. Though, after eating at GREEN, I'm seriously considering Vegetarianism.  Problem is: I'm a creature of habit. When I find a meal I like, I just reorder it over and over. (note to self: change that!)  My meal of choice at Green is the Mongolian Noodle Bowl w/the mock chicken, which is to die for. The veggies are fresh & flavorful and the mock chicken is absolutely delicious.   Equally as satisfying is the Soynami, frozen vegan ice "cream" delight and the Peanut butter thingy.  I do wish they had more drink choices.   The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I'd like to see them use whole wheat noodles and Organic. But really, that's minor. Cause like the other review mentions, their other restaurant "That's a Wrap" in Phoenix has healthier fare.  For the conscientious greenie, GREEN lives up to their name in more ways than one! The floors are concrete, the tables are made from sustainable materials (is that sorghum?) and they are definitely saving energy with what appears to be a swamp cooler. Not overly cooling on a hot Arizona afternoon but energy efficient.  Green is hands down my favorite Arizona restaurant and I've been here for 8 years. Arizona definitely needs more of these type restaurants.  The downside? They're about 40 or more miles away from my home. But with the food quality, relaxed atmosphere and Green interior, it's worth the trek for me.

As I write this review, I'm trying to think why I wouldn't give this place 5 stars. Today was my first time visiting this restaurant which is conveniently located less than a mile from my new beau's home. So we'll start with four stars until I have at least 5 visits under my culinary belt.  In the 9 and 3/4 years that I have resided in Arizona, for the first time, I have found a breakfast place I can call "home".  Let me start with the bacon.   When I ponder going vegetarian, I am only halted from executing said diet merely because there is no way on Mother Nature's Great Green Earth that I could/should/would ever give up my beloved pork strip. All bacon is not created equal but KTC has found one of the blessed thick cut smoked bacon brands that surpass most. (Costco has a great maple bacon from Canada if you trust my bacon expertise) I and my table mates were pleased.  We all ordered the day's special: Thick-cut bacon, eggs & potato cakes($7.45). Yummers! My love ordered an additional order of french toast ($4.50) with blueberries ($1.50) which he generously shared with I and his brother.  The baby-sized muffins were a nice, tasty, fresh-tasting start and didn't ruin my appetite for the main meal.  There were fresh flowers on the tables which I think is a great homey touch. The food presentation was visually pleasing. The orange juice ($2.25, large) was fresh and pulpy just like I like it. If it wasn't fresh squeezed it certainly tasted that way.  I didn't order coffee cause it was "see-through" and I like it dark & strong.  I agree with one of the other posters that the food is hella fresh tasting and this is what separates it from any of the pathetic chain restaurants its been compared to. (Incidentally, if Denny's is a place you frequent, that shit should have tasted like manna from the Heavens for you).  Did you ever have bacon & eggs that tasted like old recycled lard? Ick. That's what's missing here and that's what makes Kiss The Cook special.  The service was awesome. The staff are friendly and humorous.  The decor is country cute and mismatched as one poster pointed out which lends to its grandmotherly charm.  You get a "kiss" with your bill.  Actually, I just realized, that I would give this place 5 stars if it used Organic ingredients sourced mostly from Local Farms. That can be hard when the meals you offer do not have ingredients that are available locally.  If your palate longs for breakfast food made with "Love" and flavor, support Local Arizona small business and try Kiss the Cook!

I am sooooo not a hipster but I loved this place all the same. Staff is friendly. Coffee and baked goods are yummers. And the atmosphere is perfect for working on some school work (which is precisely why I stopped in), meeting/schmoozing with friends, people watching or even a casual first date? Tons of seating.  I've lived in the area for almost 2 years. how could I have missed this place?  Can't wait to try the regular menu.  One weird thing,  which has absolutely nothing to do with the cafe, is that it seemed almost every single person in the place has an Apple-brand laptop. It was kinda twilight-zoney. And the funny thing is my co-worker asked me the next day If I noticed that everyone had Apple Laptops. I DID! I DID!   :) Go and love it!  UPDATE - 10/20/13  OMG! I just have to update with one of the most amazing cakes I have ever had. It is a slice of Vanilla citrus cake with coconut filling. My tastebuds are doing the happy dance right now. Dee-freakin-licious, people! Earlier, I had the NY strip with couscous with carmelized onions and mushrooms and broccoli. I rarely crave red meat but for some reason I was today and Lux did NOT disappoint.   Also, I was getting hangry (hungry and angry) cause this guy in front of me was ordering like really slow and asking too many questions but this amazing, beautiful  lady with long dark hair and a warm smile, who i can only assume is the manager, calmed me with her amazing customer service and awesome chilean wine recommendation. I love Lux!

Title: Awesome Vegetarian dishes, fellow Vegheads!  ooo...My BFF and me hit this place after the Glendale Blues/Jazz Festival the other day and were pleasantly surprised. If you blink, you pass this puppy. We only found it cause we went one street too far wondering where we parked our motorcycles.  We're Veg, so we ordered from the Vegetable entree menu and split everything.  #78 Vegetarian coconut curry  - Awesome flavor although I hate white rice, it all meshed together beautifully.  #80 Flash-fried tofu with carmelized onions and tangy soy sauce - It's the sweet soy sauce that made this dish.  #84 Bok choy soup with ginger and onions - amaaaaazing flavor. Highly recommended. Tasted good for leftovers too. mmmm. mmmm  Price was hella right, peeps. Only $6.99 for each of these delicious dishes. Say wha?????  Cheap date night fer sure!  There were only like 2 servers so the service was a bit slow but very friendly.   As of  4/9/11, they weren't serving alcohol per a few posted signs. I assume waiting for a liquor license to come through.  Will be eating at this gem and recommending to friends every chance I get.

Warning: The following review contains crude language, unsavory imagery and content for immature audiences. Continue to read at your own squeamish risk.  Let's talk about two words - Butt Pee. It's usually a surprise, right? Never welcomed. Intimidating. Stops you from proceeding with daily outings and god forbid - going to work because of the unknown possible outcomes. It's usually accompanied by mild to vicious nausea and maybe stomach pains but definitely some tummy rumblin'. (Minus one STAR)  That was my day Post-Valentine's morning. An hour spent in the bathroom peeing out my rear. As I sat on the toilet afraid to move, I pondered coffee enemas, raw-ish fish and what I would tell my new boss if it came down to not being able to make it to work later.  How did this all begin?  My Most.Awesome.Love.of.My.Life took me to Trader Vic's @ Valley Ho for what threatened to be a very romantic Valentine's Day dinner. M.A.L.M.L. made reservations like a good man and we got there a little late due to his inability to grasp geography and its many offshooting directions. No worries, they hadn't given our reservation away, which if they had, would have cost My Love 50 bones, he confided in me later that evening. WTF?  We were led to our reserved table near the patio but chose to sit outside instead under the requisite restaurant heaters AZ is infamous for. The Décor is pretty bad ass. Very Polynesian and oh so fun to look at. I sat next to a big Easter Island-like Tiki head. There are tiki totems everywhere, and fatty bamboo shoots and just the whole experience, peeps.  So I order the Pink Kamaaina ($9) that comes with a souvenir glass with what looks like a cupid-like version of Mario from Mario Brothers on the glass carrying a bucket of hearts. Weird. What has that got to do with the Poly - theme? Is that supposed to be Trader Vic, himself?  Splurging (on calories and My Love's budget), I opt to do all courses today. For an appetizer, I choose the Seared Walu and Taro Root. Now I don't know what the heck a Walu is and for some reason my brain only focused on the Taro Root part. We love anything Hawaii, so I ordered it. He ordered the Thai Soup. Well, folks, Walu is a fish. And this fish came to me cooked as the dreaded 'S' word which translates (I mean really) to "Damn Near Raw, ya' sissy!". Ewww...gross. It looked like pork chops on my plate and I asked the guy what it was and for a brief second he seemed confused and I said, "I didn't order any meat" and he said did you order the Seared Walu? And I thought for a moment. I guess I did. I was so woozy from all of the V-Day activity that I hadn't realized that I'd ordered meat. Well, fish...meat.  Let me say that I am not quite a Vegetarian but ALMOST. I eat fish occasionally but that's it. My goal is 100% Veg. So I don't freak cause, well, it's fish. The DAMN NEAR RAW part, however, was unacceptable. I ate 1.5 pieces and gave up. M.A.L.M.L. ate a bite's worth and fought to choke it down. We moved on, deciding I would cook it later. The sauce on it was pretty kick a$$ though. Although, I don't recall now exactly what was in it. Oh yeah, and the Taro Root was like a sweet-ish potato chip. The Thai coconut soup was basically curry and coconut milk. Nada especial!  Main course:  I had the Macadamia Nut-encrusted Mahi Mahi and He had the Salmon. Again I don't remember the specifics of the salmon but it was tasty. It must have been a complete holiday menu because nothing we had matches their online menu. The Mahi was just OK. Nothing spectacular, but mildly palate-pleasing all the same.  I know this doesn't really help those of you who would try these dishes, but since I didn't Yelp immediately, I've forgotten some details.  For dessert: we split the Pineapple Upside Down Cake. Silently hoping it was up to par with our Hawaiian experience at the Pineapple Grill in Kapalua (Maui). Psssstttt!!!! Not even close. It seemed like they thawed it out and slapped it on the plate and served. Nothing memorable there.  The Help: We met this really cool guy from the Big Island in Hawaii of Japanese and Portuguese heritage, he confided to us. He was funny as he told tales of his shenanigans in HI, a place we dream of living one day. He brought us bread and stuff but not really sure of his role. We had 2 waitresses which was confusing and unfortunate because one of them wasn't as attentive (brunette) to our needs (rushed/distracted) & she must have gotten the benefit of still splitting the tip with the more attentive one (blonde).    Go for the atmosphere. I would head here for apps and happy hour drinks but that's about it. The choices for Vegetarians were pretty pathetic as is with most restaurants in the Valley.   Overall, I would not rush back there. Why? May I remind you how this review began? I might cautiously consider going with someone who suggests it AND pays. The bill totalled $100. Not worth it!

The absolute freshest vegetables I've ever had at home or any restaurant.  I've only ever had great customer service there. My first time there, I came into the restaurant just 15 minutes till closing and was seated and treated to awesome cuisine and excellent service. And though I felt guilty, I was not rushed to finish my meal which extended beyond closing time.   My only problems were the absence of a lunch menu with smaller portions and cheaper price and the inflexibility to substitute rice for noodles with the Buddha's feast. That last one was kind of weird to me.  Overall, I recommend this place and eat there whenever I'm in the area.

I disagree with Alexander C. I can't say enough good things about the Fontina Burger. Oh my goodness. The flavors go on and on! And I can never finish it, the thing is so darned big. The foliage on the burgers come from their Organic (according to the owners,but not certified) garden right on the premises.  And the fries that come with are super yummy. Definitely worth the $8.99 price tag. And for the sustainably-concious consumers, the menu states that the beef is local.  I've been to Joe's Farm Grill at least a dozen times and being a sad creature of habit have only ordered the one meal because I had hoped for more Organic choices.  The customer service and atmosphere is great! No limit to the outdoor and a good amount of indoor seating too.  I definitely recommend them. They are at Ray & Higley just off the 202. It's still a bit of a commute for the Queen Creeker and beyond, but the closest healthier fare that we've got.  Side Note: Be sure and visit the bathrooms at Joe's Farm Grill whether you have to "go" or not. Hint: Prepare to be transported to the future (or past)

Great sandwiches. Ample seating! Love to sit on the back patio surrounded by exotic flowers.  I love the caramel macchiato. They make their own caramel and it is divine.  Located at the Northwest corner of Ray & Higley at Agritopia, just off the 202.

Volcano-Blackened Mahi - No words to describe the exquisite flavor of this dish.  Can I just tell you that a Vegetarian actually suggested I try this? Now how good is your meal when you can make an herbivore turn omnivore?   The accompanying Caesar salad is a nice compliment as is the citrus aioli & pineapple salsa...mmm mmmm...my mouth waters just thinking of it. I'm not a big steamed white rice fan (booooooring) but I even manage to eat at least half.  Oh and as if that wasn't reason enough to get the car keys and head out now, they serve the extra yummy Longboard Lager from Hawaii that I so cherish.  The staff are friendly. The decor definitely helps to transport me to a tropical place.  If you love flavorful food, go here. Located just off the 60 on Val Vista just NW of Baseline Rd.  I've been to the Scottsdale one and this one and the flavor is always consistently delicious. I'll force myself to try another meal next time and will modify this review if need be, but for now, they "gets" a 5 from me!

Did you know there was actually stuff going on out in Queen Creek? Sure is. We've got restaurants and Wal-marts along with an ever-growing population to rival Chandler/Gilbert.   And we've got OLIVE OIL. Scrumptious and pesticide-free Olive Oil. (While that's considered Organic, they are not yet certified to make that claim). There's olive tastings in the Mill Store and tours of the farm and Mill. Check out their website at  www.queencreekolivemill.com for more info. Just walking into the store, you can watch it being bottled through a large plate glass window.  I'm a firm believer in "buying local" to reduce carbon emissions & to support our local economy. Q.C. Olive Mill's  been featured in several magazines, PBS & Arizona Highways, and more. Saw it all with my own eyes.  And the flavors...mmm.mmm...You get to taste the different flavored olive oils, the tapenades, locally-grown nuts, fresh artisan breads & crackers. And if that doesn't fill you up, there's del piero, their small bistro that features sandwiches, tasty fresh side dishes, soft drinks , pastries & coffee drinks.   Thankfully they've added indoor seating for those scorchers but I'd opt for the outdoor area next to the small herb garden on cooler days & nights.  Warning: The olive oil'll set you back a little over $11 for 8.5 oz and a whopping 15 buckaroos for the slightly larger. However, if you are a connoisseur of olive oil, you'll want to splurge for these flavors, trust me. I think this is an awesome place to make a host or other gift basket.  Directions: Check it out. From Rt. 60, I'd take Ironwood Rd about 10 miles south to Combs Rd. Make a right and it's a mile up on the right.   Or from 60, go south on Ellsworth. Left at Ocotillo Rd. Right onto Rittenhouse. Left onto Combs (crossover railroad tracks) and it'll be right there on your left.  Attention Motorcycle Riders: They've made spaces for us to park but if you're not confident riding on dirt for a few hundred feet, take your cage.

Best pizza I've tasted in Arizona - hands down and I'm from Jersey. We know good pizza!  It's healthy, has organic ingredients, and the staff at this location is friendly and efficient.  Can't beat the buy one, get one pizza deal on Tuesdays, guys!  OMG, I'm going to go get some right now!

Boooooooring. What a disappointment!  I'm all about healthy, organic food. The meals here did not wow our tastebuds at all. The reason most people shy away from healthier fare.  We asked the waitress a question that she clearly did not know the answer to but attempted to come across as knowledgeable. If I remember what it was, I will repost.  It has been several months, but it was definitely un remarkable. He had a boring pizza with the most boring of crusts. And I had the Goat Cheese ravioli. It was like eating sterile food for someone with health issues. Bland and forgettable. Healthy doesn't have to be boring.   And who cares that Andrew Weil had any hand in this place. Am I the only one who doesn't see why we should not be taking healthy eating advice from this overweight M.D.?  We may try it out one more time to be sure, but I'm in no rush to go back.

This location, by far, has the most friendliest associates around. (Despite being smack dab in the middle of some stuffy and rude PV-dwellers). They are always smiling and chatting folks up just enough to make you feel welcome and appreciated.   The ONLY issue I have is that sometimes they run out of my favorite staples. That never happened when I used to frequent the Town & Country location.  And it is the reason for 4 out of 5 stars.

Nine Iron panini was yummy and fresh. The organic chips weren't awesome. Will try the side salad next time. But first I will try this 'amazing' bruschetta everyone raves about.  Great customer service! Convenient location although if you are traveling north on Central, if you blink, you may miss it.  Atmosphere is simultaneously energetic, romantic, and relaxing. I had a to-go order but didn't want to leave.  Will definitely be back!

I am not yet vegetarian and as long as big ol' unattractive pigs that inhabit the planet and taste like bacon are roaming around, well...  I'm trying very hard to eat Vegetarian, sorta hard to eat Vegan (since I'm lactose intolerant, mostly) and minimally to eat Raw Vegan. But the latter is my ultimate body-loving goal - at least 80% of the time! But you're not reading this to hear about my culinary goals.  This month, the S.O. and me have dubbed December 2009 - Vegetarian Month. Sadly, it had only been two days and I was already craving meat for dinner so I made my 3rd visit to Loving Hut - Glendale.  First off, let's discuss the Location: I now (temporarily) reside in Glendale and this location is a pain in the @$$ even for me. Sheesh! It's near nothing of importance and if I were these brilliant enterprisers, I would search for a more convenient location for the veg-loving crowd.  Now, onto the Food and Service! The reason I gave this place 4 stars follows:  1) Phoenix, the sweet, customer service-oriented server  2) The Mongolian Wonder dish at a mere $7.25. If you try nothing else here, eat this dish, people! Trying to convert an Ominivore?  Feed 'em this and don't tell them it's not meat. If I could learn how to convert soy protein (which I try not to eat too much of due to it's estrogen-mimicking...), I would never touch red meat again without even a second thought. I don't know what's in the "homemade spices", but this meal is a brilliant substitute for the real thing. Have it with the steamed rice. I usually find white, steamed rice boring, but in this case, you don't want any flavors competing with this masterpiece. Oddly, though, it doesn't come with the rice but it's only an additional $1.50.  3) The simple message of doing our part to save the planet just by changing our diet works for me, even if only part-time. The decor is minimalistic and effective.  4) The water served before your meal is infused with orange and totally changes how i feel about restaurant water. I pass on straight-from-the-tap-water. Shut up! I know I'm a bit snobbish.  5) The Golden wontons are a yummy sub to the cream cheese-filled crab angels one usually gets at Asian-style restaurants. The orange joy is yummy but a bit pricey at $3.25 as is the Mumbai Spirit Chai.  6) There are a few products for sale should you wanna try and replicate something tasty you've had there. I've had no such luck but bought the products anyway. The Veggie "chicken" are ok.   Why I don't give Loving Hut 5 stars:  1) Location. Union Hills and 35th Ave.  Please MOVE!  2) The hours. I sometimes "forget" to eat and once made a concentrated trek way over to their location to try it for the first time only to find it closed. Arghh...There is a  2 hour time frame between 3 and 5 when they are closed.  3) Soy - Do your own research, but too much soy is just not healthy, yet it is in nearly every dish on the menu. Then the question is whether or not the soy is organic. Cause if it ain't, it's probably GMO (Genetically-Modified Organisms), and you don't wanna go there. I'll have to ask about that next time.   4) Not gonna go into detail but the whole "Supreme Master" thing kind of has a cult-like feel to it. But no one's trying to make me join anything, so I don't dwell.  5) I was very unimpressed on my 1st visit but decided to try again. The fried rice was dry and not very flavorful. And their "Golden Beauty" which is a much less flavorful and less salty version of The International Vegetarian House's Lemongrass "chicken", tasted very...soy-ee.  6) I'm not into the "Go-up-to-the-counter-and-place-your-order-then-I'll-bring-your-food-to-you" thing. I believe in full serve at a restaurant, especially if you're expecting me to tip.  7) It's a chain. Who knew?  Bottom line: If you're looking for a new vegetarian restaurant to try and you have time on your hands to make the hike to the most inconvenient location on the planet (heh, heh...I'm such an exaggerator), then try this place at least once. And if you're craving beef, go for the Mongolian Wonder dish. You won't be disappointed.  (Later in) December 2009 update: Oh my! The Hawaiian burger is absolutely divine. I LOVE IT!  Also, I received a message from Loving Hut regarding this review. They wanted me to know that they are NOT-FOR-PROFIT, the location is family-owned and that the main goal of the restaurant is to promote "compassion". Awwww....Cool points awarded, Loving Hut!   You still get 4 stars from me but as you requested, I will return!

Love, love, love this store (both Arcadia and Uptown). I really don't know how it could be any more perfect!  The other ladies have already covered the goodies so I'll keep it short (ish).  I love the awesome ladies who work there. I love Thursdays at Arcadia where you can have wine with your shopping experience. I love the handmade jewelry. I love the great prices on these upscale finds. I love that they post photos of outfits on FB cause that's usually what gets me off my butt and over there shopping. I love that local charities benefit from your purchases. I love the constant sales.  If you love deals and supporting local biz, "Like" them on FB and get over there A.S.A.P. and revel at how much you get for the money! Major Score, ladies!

Location: 51st ave & Northern (Northeast corner)  I don't really get the "shady vibe" some got from this location.   Inside, the decor is exotic, welcoming and...unexpected. Being in a strip mall, I didn't expect such attention to detail.   The Food: Fantastic. But oddly, whenever we eat AT the restaurant, the food is rave-ingly good. It seems when we take it to go, we've gotten dry, unimpressive meals a few times. Not sure what that's about.  I love that they use the broccoli stalks rather than the heads. Definitely cuts the gas factor down for me.  My favorite meals: * Crispy Fried Fish ($11.95) - Non-fishy tasting catfish in an awesome coconut curry sauce...mmmm...Ironically, the fish is NOT crispy but who cares? * Just tried the Pad-See-Yew Noodles last night ($8.95) and I looooooooooooooooooooved it. The noodles were buttery tasting and the fried tofu (you can choose from tofu, beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, scallops, squid, or seafood combo) was a great firmish consistency. * Thai Egg rolls ($2.50 for 2) - Yummy but they contain chicken and now that I'm vegetarian, can't have 'em. * Fried Rice is yummy and fresh... Comes with cucumbers and tomatoes which is kind of weird but refreshing.  There's always plenty leftover for another tasty meal manana. The customer service is cordial and friendly.  The Bad: 1) Closed Mondays (weird day to close) 2) No website (in this day and age, there is no excuse for this. No one says you have to get all fancy and post the menu and stuff but even if you just put up 1 cheap page with your name, logo, address and directions...) 3) A few issues with takeout quality 4) The mounted flat screen kind of kills the ambiance.

While I'm not happy with the cheap @$$ ring my fiancé chose, this has nothing to do with this business.  After he proposed (and I reluctantly said yes because every guy knows not to be cheap with this purchase...well all but my guy...but I digress..I love him. He chose poorly. We will get beyond this!), he took me to get my ring sized. I was a bit put off by the location. But inside, the people were dressed professionally and were helpful in my situation.   When I first got sized by the gentleman, it seems that we picked too large a size. So when I came to pick up my ring, it was still too big. The jeweler agreed to fix it right there on the spot. It only took about 30 min or so. That was much appreciated because, despite how I feel about the ring itself, it still symbolizes our promise to commit to a life together and I wanted to represent. They understood.  So while i was totally expecting a negative experience based on the previous reviews, mine was positive. The staff  was professional and friendly. I don't know about diamond quality. I do know it has a brown tint and i read that that is fine but most people just prefer clear. I don't care about that. I would still recommend folks get a 3rd party to appraise any diamond you purchase from anywhere. I asked my fiancé and his experience in picking out the ring was also positive.

It's been a couple of years since I've been to this salon. I tried to let the bitterness pass before I commented but thinking about it again has brought the nasty taste back.   My locs were started here and I was pleased with the results but I would not recommend going to the owner, China or whatever she goes by. I don't want to slander her because she didn't say anything negative to me but she seemed aloof and would stop in the middle of doing my locs to text or call someone about a hair show she was preparing for without so much as an "excuse me". She kept me waiting about 40 minutes or more after my appointment was to begin, taking 2 (not 1) patrons before me. My time is freakin precious, too, lady!  She left me under the dryer too long and just pretty much didn't seem to give a shit about me having a positive experience at her salon. Shame. She was seriously distracted and not cognizant of my time. And yes, she is not cheap so I expect a better level of service. Like an idiot, I tipped her generously but she will never get my business again and I will never recommend her. The trade-off.  I can not speak for the other stylists. In fact, Vela ( I believe her name is) was the complete opposite. Attentive, pleasant and looked like she was darn good at what she does. She was the one who realized that I was under the dryer for too long and noticed that Miss owner lady was distracted. Even if her mind was preoccupied with all that needed to be done for her hair show, that is no excuse to provide sub par service to your clients.  I was very excited to try this place because I read the story of the how she had to fight to open the salon without getting a regular cosmetology license since they don't deal with chemicals. It was a great win for the state.  Salon is clean.  Take your chances but you've been warned.

One of the absolute best experiences I have ever had in all my years of going to a Gyno office or any doctor's office for that matter.   I was called in like a minute or two after my scheduled time. Which was a nice surprise since I had to wait like 2 months to get an initial appointment with a FEMALE doctor. To clarify, I would have had an earlier appt. had I agreed to a male doctor (which is a no-no for me) or N.P.  The front desk lady was nice and was suprised that the office was on  YELP. The back office staff were friendly and smiling. The medical assistant was very friendly and with a great sense of humor.   And above all, I fell in love (in a straight way) with Dr. Celeste Pottorff. I am a people person and I love kind people. She is beautiful with the cutest dimples and perfect bedside manner. She listened intently to my issues and explained possible future actions with the most compassion, empathy and respect I've ever encountered. She provided a comical distraction while performing the cringeworthy exam we all hate to deal with (that darn cold, rigid speculum thingy). I highly recommend her to anyone searching for the whole experience.  So to reiterate, it was an overall positive experience:  * great covered parking garage * Convenient location * friendly staff * nice large waiting room * short wait times * Dr. Pottorff is awesome!  Con:  * Takes a long time to get an appointment for a female doctor. * This isn't really a con because in all fairness, they are not naturopathics but I prefer homeopathic treatment and nutrition versus prescriptions which only take care of symptoms versus treating the whole person so I like to receive advice in that vein. Thus, 4 stars vs 5.  UPDATE 6/11/13  Had another appointment today. The tech was professional and had a great sense of humor. Got called in 3 minutes after my appt. No waiting. I witnessed an unprofessional exchange between a couple of staff members regarding another patient which I found very insensitive and uncool in a place housing such sensitive information but other than that, this office is a winner!

***I am rating from a vegetarian and customer service perspective so take that into consideration when reading my review.***  I really like Scratch. I love sitting outdoors. Phoenix is BEGINNING to feel like a CITY city.  I can empathize with others regarding not knowing what to do when you first walk in if no one greets you immediately but after the initial visit, just do your thing.  They have a tasty vegan burger which hits the spot every time. It's so not the typical thoughtless effort most non-vegetarian places do NOT put into their burgers. And omg, my tattooed (points for this) server was quick to let me know that the truffle fries are vegetarian but not vegan and offered me pesto-tossed fries instead. OMG, they were so YUM!  I really appreciate that kind of service. I personally think that the fact that it takes them a long time to come back to you is to allow you to slowly enjoy your food and the experience. I mean it's not fast food, for goodness sakes. Its French, for whatever that signifies.  I would like to see more creative vegetarian choices but I realize that that is wishful thinking and I give them kudos for the 7 vegetarian/Vegan offerings. Not many restaurants give that much thought to alternative palates unless it specializes in that type of cuisine.  Go and bring your patience.

Absolutely amazing burgers. I've had both the grass fed beef and the regular angus beef. Both do NOT disappoint. I am a creature of habit. When I find something I love, I stick with it and the Llano Poblano Burger is bomb. The french fries are fresh and tasty. I love to wash it all down with a Lumberyard Hefeweizen. Perfect combo. Staff is friendly and fun. I don't normally like sitting at the bar but the seats are comfy and you're closer to the alcohol and ample room to eat, so why not? They also have veg, lamb, turkey and bison burgers. You gotta try this place. Cross streets are Shea Blvd and Scottsdale Rd.

Ok so I'm only doing "mostly veg" right now so I may have meat once or twice a week. I decided to use up one of my meat allowances here and boy did I get my money's worth. I had the Truffle mac (and cheese) with hot italian sausage. My goodness, I could have died it was so darn good. Just perfect. I can't articulate exactly how it was perfect, just that the flavor was out of this world. High quality sausage. I think I read another review that said they made their own sausage? I could totally see that. It tasted very fresh.  The Agave Apple Slaw which my friends raved about wasn't bad but the minute I opened the dressing container, my senses were assaulted with the intense stench of vinegar which is still hanging in the air. It calmed down a bit after sitting on the salad for a bit. I will try it again when I eat in. Today, i took it to go.   My co-workers loved their Pepperoni pizzas and monkey bread (which were more like garlic knots) with awesome flavor.  Staff  is very friendly. Jamie is awesome. Fantastic customer service. I'm also a fan of sister restaurant, Switch. I think this place is here to stay, folks.   I will update once I've tried other meals here for the big picture. The fact of the matter is, there WILL be a next time...mmmm mmmm  10/11/13 update:  Mushroom mac is tasty. But the Truffle mac is definitely my fave for life.  Co-workers highly recommend: Pub Burger, Leezie's Sweet & Spicy Korean wings, and Seoul Fire pizza. One said the Jalapeno canoes were too mild which means I will probably like them.  Tom, an owner I believe he said, who intro'd himself to me and thanked me for being a new regular. That was very cool.  If you haven't eaten here yet, what ARE you waiting for? It's just across Central from the Burton Barr library.

Hands down my favorite place to go for Happy Hour. Also, a great date place. I guess this would be considered a Hipster place but I just love the atmosphere, the food, the beer and the excellent staff. Absolutely never disappointed with service or food quality. Plenty of outdoor/indoor seating. $5 beer pitchers. Braised beef and crispy fish tacos are my faves and highly recommended.  Love, love, love it!

Tasty fast food with options for Vegetarians and Vegans. Just moved to the Paradise Valley area and this is hands down my favorite place for a healthier quick meal option.   They are not stingy with the portions and I always leave slightly stuffed.   So far I've had the build your own plate which I could barely finish and today the gyro. Both chock full of flavorful goodness.  Bonus: my to-go bag read: "Live Bait" which is funnier than they know because there are some unscrupulous people at my office who like to steal other people's food. Way to throw 'em off the scent, Garbanzo.  Hope you guys are here to stay...

The wait kind of sucked.  I wonder if that was because it was New Years Day. Anyway,  the portions were humongous. I ordered the b.a.l.t. (bacon, avo, lettuce, tomato). It came with yummy  french fries, a chicken veggie tortilla soup and a pickle. I had the strawberry o.j. which was fresh squeezed  and delicious.  Bacon was a little overcooked but good. Soup had bomb flavor.   My love had the meat omelet (not what it's  called).  Not sure what all was in it but it was a pretty  hearty portion.  He had hash browns and pancakes with it. Pancakes were kind of dry. The hash browns were a little burnt. Plates had nice presentation.   Nice,friendly staff. Not sure what the decor was trying to achieve but I didn't go there for that. I went for a tasty meal and that's just what we got.
