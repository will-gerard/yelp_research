These guys are the best. Friendly service and some of the best Mexican food in Tempe. they've got everything too from bongs, to cheap liquor, and cigars. Go here at least once a week for something.

the food takes a long time and it's overpriced, but definitely is always consistent with the delicious food. great place to watch a game

This venue was disappointing. They had no clear signs as to what line was what, and no one seemed to give a shit about their customers. Of course paid for an insanely overpriced, watered down mixed drink. Not coming back again
