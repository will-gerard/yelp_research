My friends and I have often frequented this locale for their late night happy hour (10-close) even on weekends for the past three years. I am leaving town and I felt that I ought to yelp about how excellent this place is. The bartenders are fantastic, funny, and remember your order. We usually sit at the bar, but sitting out on the patio (with Renee as a waitress) is also an option for the happy hour.  Not only are the sake bombs excellently priced, but there is a little buffet (free) of sushi, egg rolls, and some meat dish. If you want more sake for your bomb, it's only a dollar extra.  The outfits that the wait-staff wears is a little awkward though. I understand it is supposed to be Japanese fusion, but the outfits just look too tight and uncomfortable for servers and are probably way more expensive than having them wear standard black.  Overall no complaints, and I bring almost everyone I know to this place.

Tonight was my last time that I will be going there. New management changed the rules for happy hour. There is no longer a reverse happy hour and skyy drinks are now taken off the list. When I called and asked about the reverse happy hour, I was treated as if the question were insane to ask (when I had previously been there). Additionally, going during regular happy hour, my friend and I ordered strictly happy hour offerings and were not told that Skyy drinks were no longer on there. When we asked the manager why we were not previously informed, we were told they no longer give happy hour menus.

Not only did they quickly and honestly service my bike, but the food was delicious as well.

Bruschetta are large and well-priced. Great place for a date or just to sip wine and pick at food with friends. The decor makes the locale seem classy.

Looking for a day trip from Phoenix metro area, this is it. You can spend a good 3 hours exploring this abandoned mining town.  $10 gets you a "guide" that basically just delineates the trail to follow so you can see all of the buildings that are still standing.  You want history AZ, this is it!
