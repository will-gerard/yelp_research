I just relocated here from Chicago & saw them while driving around. I had a recent exam and new frames, I just needed it filled. I walked in without an appointment & inquired about my insurance & what I needed & walked out less than 15 minutes later with everything taken care of. My glasses arrived in a timely manner & are great. Very nice staff!

No one likes dealing with car issues. The people here make is as pleasant as possible. They're not pushy when making suggestions. Fair prices. I actually don't mind having my car worked on. Highly suggest!

I'm a foodie from Chicago so I was told to check out the FRC places. I have started with Greene house. I was lucky enough to have an amazing server named Mel. He was extremely knowledgeable on basically everything. I would def suggest the Pink & Greene martini. It may have been one of the best martinis I have had in a while. I would skip the horseradish potatoes. Good but not great. Def try the fish tacos. They are tapas size and super amazing!!

I thought other reviews were exaggerating so I decided to try it some close to home. They weren't. This place is awful. Not only do they barely clean the interior, they're not very friendly. I then got home to realize my antenna was gone. I went back, asked to get it and they were acting like it was my fault. Yeah because I always take my antenna off for no reason. You took it off to wash it, so just own it, find it and put it back. Never going back. Ever.

I did the unthinkable- lost my car and house keys. I called Levi based on other reviews here and was so glad I did. He met me at my car in no time and had me unlocked and a new key made right there. Not only was he so nice, his prices can't be beat. I will use him again if needed!!! Oh and he can reprogram key fobs cheap too!! 5 star service!!!

I hadn't found a salon since moving here from Chicago. I live in Kierland but didn't want to try a lot of the snotty places. My boss told me I had to try her stylist Michael. She even made the appt. I was changing my style pretty drastically so I was apprehensive. I showed him a couple pics, he asked some questions and went to work. One of the best cuts I've had. Ever. Also, he didn't shove products at me. I asked and he made suggestions. Friendly staff, bright and open space. Highly suggest!

Great location and atmosphere. Slightly pricey but good food. You must do the fresh.cheese table side. That is with the visit alone!!

OK so I guess I will Google this place as the website here is a bogus one that takes you to some singles site. I was interested in finding a studio that offered adult dance lessons/classes, this came up and no legit info.

I had just moved to the area and needed a nail salon. I was pretty specific on my requirements. Let's just say I refuse to go to the places found in your shopping malls & on every corner.  I came across Avare, walked in, made an appt. for same day, met Heidi and loved her. Prices are the same as what I paid back in Chicago. She is great! And I had the same nail tech, a friend of mine, for over 8 years so I was happy to find Heidi and her services so quickly. I have now been back a couple times. Very cute, airy overall space as well & rest of staff are also friendly! Highly suggest for gel nails!!

The food was over 20 minutes late, cold and subpar. They get 2 stars for being cheap. Will not order again with so many other places to choose from. Plenty of mixed reviews so this place must be hit or miss. It was a miss for me.
