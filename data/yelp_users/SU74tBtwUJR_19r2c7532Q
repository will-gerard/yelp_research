This Pei Wei is consistently good, and this particular location has always been good to me. For a quick meal this is about as good as it gets. Pei Wei is a step above any takeout type Chinese food place, but not quite 5-star restaurant quality. To me, it's about a 4 out of a possible 4 for the type of restaurant they are. The quality is always good, the service is quick, they listen/care, and they'll let you adjust any meal to how you want it...exactly what I expect from any restaurant, but I'm always shocked how many don't do those basic things. The management team here has been excellent as well. If they screw something up, they've offered to give it to me for free, remake it, or just ask me what I want. They do all the basics right, and deliver a quality tasty product.

Good view with bad breath waiter! The view is great but I expect a lot more than just a view from a restaurant trying to be the high end of restaurant. The service was poor and our waiter was just awkward (oh and he had horrible breath).  The food was ok but not great. For a restaurant that charges the high end prices I expect high end service & high quality food. My girlfriend and I both ordered the filet and they were both slightly over cooked but not enough to send them back. It was my girlfriends birthday so they were nice enough to bring out a free dessert but they should have asked me if it was something we liked first because it was not. I would have rather paid for a dessert that we both enjoyed.  So in summary, the view is A+ along with a romantic setting, food below average for what i expect & service was poor.

First time here and I would definitely go back. Great friendly service with a real local feel like everybody already knows you. I felt like I was walking into Cheers where everybody knows your name. The staff was just super friendly, in a good mood, and talking to everybody. My order was pretty difficult because I'm always customizing things, so it's usually a crap shoot if it comes out right. Everything was perfect, hot, and tasted really good.  Great little small local cafe spot for breakfast!

Good little spot for breakfast. I'm pretty limited for what I can eat for breakfast right now because I can't eat eggs or wheat. They had some great options and basically let me custom order exactly what I wanted. It came out just like I ordered and the service was great. Only thing they could improve on is the quality of their coffee.

I've been coming to this breakfast spot for years, and the food is always consistently good. I was there this morning, and it has recently had a nice upgrade. The interior furniture and decor is upgraded, which makes it a nicer atmosphere. The menus are updated, and the food is still good. It's a nice little local breakfast spot.

I just had one of the worst grocery shopping experiences of my life here. I've shopped here 1-3 times a week for the past 8 years & I'm not going back if I can avoid it. This is the closest & most convenient grocery store to my house. I went here the most in the past because of convenience, but never because they had the best selection.  I was grabbing some quick dinner items on my way home & at checkout I was embarrassed that I forgot my wallet. Nobody was in line behind me, so I asked if I could I run out to my car to grab it. I didn't have my wallet, but luckily had my checkbook. My bill was only $44. I wrote a check, but she wouldn't let me use my check without ID. I've literally checked out with this same woman at least 50 times & she makes a comment on my last name every time as "Doolittle" isn't very common. I asked for a manager "override" & the manager (Dan N.) came over and said no. Ok, so a place I've been a regular at for 8 years won't let me use a check for a $44 bill. I took a breath because I was pretty embarrassed at this point, and asked her if there was anything else we could do.  She told me would put my groceries to the side while I ran home to grab my ID. So, reluctantly I did exactly that. I live 5 minutes away so I was back within 15 min. I came back with my wallet (ID, cash & cards), and asked them what they wanted me to do...pay up front or at same register. They all looked dumb founded because my groceries were gone. They started pointing fingers about somebody putting them away. I had to laugh at this point, but I started walking out. I was not treated as a loyal customer, the manager did not make an effort to help, and there was no apology at the end. As I was walking out I saw the same manager (Dan N.) and let him know my groceries weren't up there, I shop there multiple times a week, but I'm never going back again. He had not reaction, no apology, and did not try to do anything. It was like he was half asleep and had no reaction at all.  I drove up the street to Albertsons right after and purchased the same groceries. With all the big data grocery stores have on us I wonder what it takes to acquire another frequent & loyal customer like myself. Additionally, they use all this personal shopping data they collect on us to market, but they don't treat a loyal customer with any kind of special service or consideration? Very disappointing experience.

This was the first time I used this cleaners. I needed same day service, which they provided, but the sign said they closed at 7PM. I got there and 7:30PM, and the man was very nice to help me. I got my clothes even though they were supposed to be closed, and I was a very happy customer.

I always have hope for this place because the location is perfect for me, and it seems like they have the right theme going for a decent restaurant, but I'm always let down every time I've tried it. The last time I went I sat in the bar area expecting to get faster service, but it was the exact opposite. They kept forgetting about our drinks, it took over 20 minutes to get our food, no refills, didn't ask if I wanted another beer, and then we couldn't even find our waiter when we were done to get our tab which ended up taking 15 minutes. The food wasn't great & it was kind of cold. If I hadn't of waited so long I would have sent it back. It was obvious that are disappearing waiter forgot about our food & it probably sat there getting cold.  The location is still great for me, so I'll probably try it again like an idiot. Who knows maybe I'll have a better experience next time, but for now I feel that 2 stars is being generous.

What a great authentic Italian spot. Get groceries, fresh made pasta, or have a sandwich. I go here mostly for the sandwiches, which are the best in town. The meatball sandwich is excellent, but I like to make my own Italian combo sandwich which is superb every time.

Been going here for years and it's the best Italian spot I know of in Arizona. Fresh homemade pastas to cook at home, pizza, sandwiches, deli, anti pasta, and all sorts of side salads. I've tried almost everything and it's all delicious. Everything is super fresh, and they'll make anything you want. It's always a tasty Italian experience with a great local business feel. Everybody I've brought here has a great experience as well.  The only thing that is tough is it gets super busy at the popular times, so it's tough to get a seat if you want to eat there. Other than that I have no complaints.

Great for lunch! I had never been here for lunch but walked over after there was a huge line at Chop Shop. I ordered some edamame to start, a chicken teriyaki bento box and some assorted sashimi. Food was hot, tasty, fresh, and came quickly. The lunch portions were great and the pricing was very reasonable. Definitely high quality for the price. The service has always been great here & that was consistent again this time as well.  I come here for dinner often and now I'll be coming here for lunch more frequently too.

This is a staple and I come here at least twice a week. They would get 5 stars except they always seem to be understaffed. I get to-go orders which is pretty quick, but eating in drives me crazy every time.  The food is always excellent and consistent. Very healthy options and probably the best hummus in town. The service is poor, so as long as you're patient it's ok. I'm not sure if the management team even notices or cares because I've been coming here for a long time, and it has never changed.

You always know what you're getting with one of these Fox Concept restaurants, but I had a great customer service experience the other night. I needed to grab some dinner real quick, but I knew most places were closed already. I showed up at Sauce at 9:05PM, and they closed at 9. I opened their front door anyway, and asked if they were still serving. They said "No," so I turned around and walked out as I had expected. Then about 10 seconds later, another person working there chased after me and said "Hey, maybe we can help you, what are you ordering & we'll see if we can still make it." I was getting a pretty simple chicken salad to-go, so they said it wouldn't be a problem, and they'll have it ready for me as quickly as possible. They made it fresh, and I was ecstatic that they stayed a little later then they had to in order to make me happy.

This is a staple for Old Town Scottsdale and for good reason. Great place to meet up for a drink, get dinner, hang out on the patio on a nice day, hold an event in one of their cool dining rooms, or grab a little breakfast at their attached cafe. They can really do it all anytime of the day, year round, and everything is good. I can't remember ever having bad service and I wouldn't go there so often if I did. It's a staple for Scottsdale and a consistent "go to" spot for me.

This place is the perfect place for what you expect from a Mexican grill....great tacos, margaritas & cold beers. I love their chips & salsa, and they wait staff is always good about making sure you have plenty of it. After the chips & salsa I usually get the black & pepper wings, which are excellent. You wouldn't expect good wings at a Mexican food place, but they're really good here. For my main dish their hard shelled tacos are the best, but I've had several other things and it's always consistent. Lunch or dinner this is a great quick casual Mexican food spot.  Although I do like their food the best thing about this place is the atmosphere or more specifically the patio. If it's Spring Training time or if it's nice out during the day it's hard to beat this place. Grab a cold Corona & kick it on the patio in the sun!

This is my go to spot for pizza! They use super high quality ingredients, so it tastes as good as some of the higher end/high priced/well known options around town, but they're very reasonably priced & almost never a wait time for a table. I've had almost every pizza on the menu and they're always perfect.  Of course the gelato is the best I've ever had. Fresh flavors straight from Italy and I had my first ever Affagato here, which is 2 shots of espresso poured over a scoop of gelato. Amazing!  The service is great and the staff provides a nice back home atmosphere where everybody is friendly towards each other. Five stars for food, service & price!

This is normal bar food, so you get what you would expect. I sat at the bar and the service was poor. It took forever for the bartender to take my order, and then for the food to arrive. She was walking around, talking to other employees & messing with the TV's, while I was patiently waiting for my food. I ordered an appetizer and a meal. When the food finally came out everything came at once instead of my appetizer first as anybody would want and should expect. So, I waited a long time and then the order was messed up. Shocker! I asked the bartender to put my main meal back under the heat while I ate my appetizer, which she did. However, when I was done with the appetizer it took me a while to find her again to tell her I was ready for my main meal. Expecting a timely refill wasn't even a thought on her mind either, but it didn't shock me at that point.  So, normal bar food and poor service.

Always a great place to have breakfast & the service is excellent. The pancakes are amazing but if you're looking for something healthy they're great at that too.  I have had their french toast and their pancakes and they're both top notch. Lately, I've been eating extremely healthy, so I had an egg white omelet "made to order," and it was amazing.  Only bad thing about this place is that it's so good, you'll definitely have to wait for a table on the weekends, but it's worth the wait.

Best Ortho in AZ! I had the same orthodontist back in California from the time I was 8 years old until I graduated high school who I thought was great at the time. When I moved to Arizona my teeth needed some correcting from not wearing my retainer, so I sought out a local orthodontist that did Invisilign. I was not that happy with the results. About 4 years after that I met Dr. Murphy, and he convinced me to try it again. I am ecstatic about the results, and I get compliments on my teeth & smile weekly. He provides a great service, got me the results I desired, his staff was wonderful to work with, he provides a fun environment, and the whole experience was excellent from beginning to end.

Had to go here on a busy night with 2 small chihuahuas and had a great experience with the staff & doctors. They were really good with the dogs & really nice to us. It was a pretty busy night there, so we had to wait quite a while. The dogs in front of us had much worse issues, so I can understand why we had to wait. I would have liked a little better communication in the beginning on how long it was going to be, which is why I didn't give this place 5-stars. Once we asked a couple questions after waiting for a bit they were excellent with us. Then when we finally met the vet she was SUPER nice & an excellent communicator!

Great burger spot! They have all kinds of different burger options like ahi, short rib, buffalo, beef, etc. It's fun to order the small 3 ounce versions to be able to try multiple kinds. However, once I tried everything I've realized that it's tough to get a 3 oz. burger to taste Medium Rare, so if I feel like beef then I would go for a larger size. The wings are good and the sweet potato fries are excellent!

Finally found great Toddy coffee in AZ! I moved away from AZ to Austin for 6 months, and I love all the local businesses out there including their coffee shops. I discovered iced toddy coffee out there, and I have been searching for the same thing since I've been back in AZ for months. Well, I found it here at Cartel Coffee Lab, and it's some of the best I've ever tasted!  Additionally, I think I'm part of the majority of people that is sick of Starbucks, but the convenience of them being on every corner is hard to avoid. "Ugh I don't want Sturbucks, but I'm going there anyway...." How many people have done that?!? Cartel Coffee Lab is worth the extra 10 minute drive, or planning your day/route to work it in. All the different coffees I've tried are excellent, the staff is great, and they have a great relaxed but still energetic atmosphere.  It's a great place to just grab a coffee, meet a friend, have a one-on-one business meeting or get locked in by yourself for a while.

I've been going here for about 10 months now and I still love it every day. I travel a ton & have done CrossFit in boxes all over the country and this is still my favorite. Great owner, great coaches, love the way the workouts are organized compared to other gyms & the atmosphere is amazing!

I've been going to Cactus CrossFit for about a year now and I love it! The owner/coach, Kevin, is amazing. He's got a great personality, very nice to everybody, and has created a great atmosphere here. I didn't know how good this CrossFit gym was until I traveled around the country to many more. I've been to CrossFit gyms in Austin, Salt Lake City, Washington DC, Seattle and Pennsylvania....and this one is by far the best.  I've been getting great results, and whether you're an experienced crossfitter looking to switch gyms, traveling and want to drop in, or brand new to CrossFit then this is THE place for you.

I've eaten at several different Buffalo Wild Wing locations, but this particular location was a bad experience. Mostly just bad service. I bartender/waitress was missing half the time, so I couldn't get refills. I asked for my salad first, but she brought it with my food. The food took a long time, and then semi warm when it came, so I'm sure it was ready in the kitchen, but my server didn't notice it for a while. Then when I finally wanted to leave I couldn't find her to pay my bill and leave.

Good shakes & great place to get health coaching. I would still consider One-Stop to be the best place in Arizona for protein shakes or health products, but this is another great option. I like the shot of Aloe that comes with every shake for hydration and the tea, which is designed to speed up your metabolism. That's different than your typical shake place, and they provide health coaching if you need it. The ambiance isn't the greatest, but I'm not really looking for that when I need a quick shake.

One of the best breakfast spots in Arizona! As you would expect with the name, the pancakes are amazing!  They have some great healthy options as well, and they are very cool about subbing out things or ordering something completely custom. Everything I ordered was great and I always leave absolutely stuffed because I just want to keep eating. Definitely going to come back here more often.  There is a wait a lot of times, but the staff does a good job moving people around and communicating to the customers. All around an excellent breakfast spot! Great food & great service.

I'm torn between a 4 star and 5 star for this place. The food, drinks and atmosphere were all amazing. It's the perfect breakfast, brunch, lunch spot and great when it's a nice day outside to sit on the patio.  We had a couple items from the bakery, a salad, chicken sandwich, and a scoop of the tuna salad....all were great! The service was definitely slow which is the only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars. It may just be the kind of place that has a more relaxed atmosphere and nothing is a rush. I didn't expect that so I was a bit impatient. Maybe I'll move it up to a 5 star next time knowing that it's a more mellow atmosphere & I should take my time enjoying the amazing food.

This is a great quick service Greek restaurant for eating in or taking to go. Good healthy options & quality food. I go here for the chicken or steak kabobs regularly with a side of grilled vegetables. It always tastes good, and makes eating healthy pretty enjoyable. This gets 4 stars out of a possible 4 stars for the type of restaurant they are. I am a regular here, and will continue to be.

I was so excited to finally find a place that served quality iced Toddy coffee in Arizona. This place has a great vibe, and great coffee products. It's a smaller location than the original in Tempe, but still a great place to meet, get some work done, or just hangout.  Iced coffee is a must in the hot Arizona heat, so if you haven't had iced Toddy coffee before then you MUST go here and get some.

The food was average. I ordered the NY steak & it wasn't that flavorful and didn't seem to be a good quality cut of meat. On the bright side the wine was good, the staff was nice & the side dishes were decent. The atmosphere was probably the best thing about the place. I might go back sometime to have a glass of wine, but I'm not interested in going back for dinner.

What a shocker walking into this place in downtown Phoenix! It has a really cool setup with a market on one side, table service, take-out, or full service at the bar. The interior is huge and very modern. I ordered a chicken salad, which came out super fast, and it was excellent. It was super fresh & tasty.  If I'm downtown I'm definitely going back to this place.

Super small place downtown. I could barely find it because it's so small and stuck in between a few other spots on a strip off of Mill Ave. It has one row of counter space and a few other tables. There was one cook on staff and one waitress. The waitress was super nice & very outgoing. Great little spot, but I wouldn't go with more than a couple people if you want to interact with them there. However, if you want a quick breakfast with great service then this is your spot.. The food was solid too. I didn't order anything crazy, so I got what I expected. It's exactly what you would expect from a small diner, but the staff really makes sure you'll get exactly what you want.

I have driven by this place a thousand times and always wanted to try it. Finally I did today and I was disappointed. The staff was very nice and the location is great. Since its "America's Taco Shop" I ordered the three assorted taco plate with some chips & salsa. All the meat was super dry and overall pretty tasteless. The food came out super quick, which is good from a service perspective, but I knew the food had probably been cooked earlier & sitting there for a while. As I ate each taco my intuition was right as it just tasted like re-heated meat and not much flavor with it. The chips weren't too fresh but not bad. The best part of the meal was the salsa as that was very good, but not enough to get me to go back. The service & the salsa kept this review at a 2-star instead of a 1-star.  I left thinking that this could be an amazing place because of the location and the patio, but the food was just disappointing. I would have to know that they upgraded their food in order for me to ever go back again.

Healthy, cost effective, good pressed juices, and great tasting. Portions small.  Everything about this place is 5 star except for the portions. I would like the lunch portions to be a bit bigger and an option to order a larger juice. I tried ordering my juice without ice one time because they fill up the entire cup full of ice, but they just gave me less juice. It does take a while for the juices to be made as well, which always seems weird for a simple process. It seems like they're trying to manage their costs with the portions and the staff doesn't seem too motivated to get orders out quickly. They don't seem to be too concerned with customer satisfaction.  The food and juices are excellent. Very healthy, organic, and local. Very simple menu, but great options to choose from. Breakfast and lunch are both excellent, and the cold pressed juices are good for both or a good snack.  I have become a regular at this place because it's the perfect mix between healthy, taste, local, and variety.

Great new burger spot in the heart of Scottsdale. I think they just opened in the beginning of July '13. I've been 3 times in the first month, and it's been better each time. The service is a little slow, but they're very nice and they made sure I got everything I wanted. I think that once they've been open a while the service will get better. The burgers were excellent each time & came out super hot.  You can make your own burgers or mac n' cheese here, and it comes out exactly how you want it. There's a big list of beers as well as you would expect from their name. There are TV's everywhere and they're all big. I will definitely be coming back here during football season.  Once this place gets their service locked in then it's a 5-star place for a bar/burger/sport type restaurant.

The golf and venue for entertainment is absolutely 5 stars! Great concept and fun to hit balls for any level of player. The food is typical bar food and not the greatest which is the only reason I dropped them down to a 4 star.  I'll definitely be a regular here and do some events for my company here as well.

Wild at Heart has the best services for your skin and Penny is the best esthetician out there. I've had facials at hotels and other spa's, but nothing compares to the service I get at Wild at Heart. The facials are painful and feel great at the same time. Haha! Whenever I have an issue with my skin Wild at Heart is always quick to respond whether I'm in the studio or if I'm at home and they can help over the phone/text. She's a perfectionist when it comes to my eye brows so I know she's the same with her permanent makeup services for women.  Everybody I've ever told to go to Wild at Heart is always happy with the services and they're converted to her for life. I will continue to go there and recommend her services to everybody.
