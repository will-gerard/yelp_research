Walked in today to browse around, then se something interesting. A laser printer for $50. Looking around there were no associates to help. Walked to one if the registers to ask for assistance and was told the asst mgr would help me as soon as he finished bringing up the furniture. So while waiting for him, I browsed more selections. And after about 5 mins he showed up, asked if I still required help and then stated if I can hold on for a couple more minutes so he could get me a specialist. That threw me for a spin a bit. U would think the asst mgr could help me a bit before just sending me back out to wait. I can see that customer service is not a priority in this establishment. If it was, you would think that I would be assisted somewhat while waiting for the so called specialist. Unfortunately he just walked away.   20 mins later and still no one, the asst mgr came back up to me as I finally walked up to me and asked if I was helped. Nope, no one helped me, not even you. He apologized and then stated sorry, maybe next time. Really, next time, are you serious. Why even bother, if no one knows what's happening in the store, especially the asst mgr.

I've found that some sushi places are pretty good. But Tomo's is a mark above the rest. First off is the look and feel of an establishment when you walk in. Which is exactly what you receive when you walk right through the front door.   There are of course many ways to enjoy sushi, but I have found that at the sushi bar itself. Where you actually get to see the art that they out into their creations is the best seat of the house.   There are of course multiple selections that one may order. And whatever you do receive. I must add that it's never skimpy. Unlike most places where they cut thin. Tomo's provide a nice thick slice. Perfectly balanced and ensured that you actually are able to taste their fresh fish creation and not just the sauce that is drizzled upon them.   Of course the staff must be mentioned as well. They don't push, and they are quite patient. I'm not one if the quickest people when it comes to ordering so its very genuine when you don't hear or see the wait staff looking away as they wait for u place their order. One if the most humblest of trademarks.   In conclusion, it is a very nice modest establishment. Why not 5 stars you ask. While the fish, rice and sauces are great and wonderful together. It is what we eat most of that has a little lack, the rice. Dry, no sweetness. No flavor as u would expect to receive, even in preparation and cooking. Rice itself has some balance. The tempura on the spider roll I had was not the crunchy kind you'd expect. It felt a little soggy.   And so I would suggest for those that would like to enjoy a nice thick serving of tempura to fly, drive and stop by. Only with more tastes and people can they truly improve upon perfection.

Once walking in, I can see there's already a line. Great I thought, another long wait. This place was much different. The barista was taking drink orders even before you were being waited in to get the coffee made and out there. The line moved very quickly. And service was presented with a smile and cheer. Family friendly atmosphere, clean floors. The manager walks around and asks how everything is. And they're always cleaning. I have 4 stars, for my particular service. Ordered a coffee coolata and already paid. Then was told they didn't have it. So front counter people need to have more information about what's going on when waiting on ppl. Ok

I'm appalled by the service that has come into this once treasured and beautiful establishment. At the rate that this cafe is going with changing servers or people that work there. It's soon to become an eye sore or forgotten name rather than a good organic and wholesome family friendly atmosphere.   Arriving it's usually always packed. So of course they'll be some wait. Though now I see that it has become inexcusable. Upon arrival and placing our order. We located a nice yellow half moon table near the wall. As we looked around I could see 2 other tables. But all of them still had food or some sort of disgusting particles all over them. I politely asked a person at the counter if I could please get a wash cloth. I understand you can be busy, maybe I can at least do it quicker and you can move on with orders.   Is this what made the rest of the time unhappy. Did we say or do something that caused them to deny us a basic and pleasurable time. For after that simple ask of clearing the table. It all went down hill.   We sat at the table, and waited. I listened to some music and my wife had a conversation on the phone. Tables started leaving and new people arriving. Servers moving about and still nothing arrived.   I hate to complain or to even state the obvious, though we all should enjoy ourselves. And 35 mins later, we're still at the table waiting. It got under my skin as the people behind us in line and those after that who ordered had already received their food. And are working on dessert.   I walked to the back, locating one of their polite employees asking if they might have seen our order. A few minutes later one of the guys approached our table to state we're next. NEXT, we should have received it 40 minutes ago. And we continued to wait.   My god, it's been an hour. I've seen new people come and go, tables being dismissed and still no food. Did they lose the ticket. Not once did anyone come up, and ask - anything.   Finally, our food arrived. Well I guess something arrived. After stating the fact they rushed to the order. Not the order we placed, just what the menu states. We asked at the beginning for sauce on the side. Instead I received Krakatoa on my plate, sauces over run the food. Ugh, horrible. Seriously, fess up. Don't cover up, it's the worst way to do business.   So with Krakatoa on the plate I walked back to the kitchen asking for our ticket. Just to be sure if sauce on the side was overheard or dismissed. And with that, we sat down at the table waiting for our plate of organically with sauce in the side.   Well folks the kitchen people royally screwed the pooch on this one. They misplaced, again the remake of sauce on the side until we once again nudged them 30 mins later. Total time approaching 2hrs.   The food is good, fresh and tasty. Though not pleasurable to the palate when you're made to wait, when it's made incorrectly. Nausea fills your stomach and everything you eat is sludge.   At the end of the ordeal, all said and done we left. Was it pleasurable - no. Did it Taste well- it did and not. Was it worth it - no.   Clean up house, pay more if you have to, fix the leaks, train better. So that we may eat and enjoy ourselves as we need to.

A huge improvement, a complete turn-around. As though Mr. Happy himself has been imbued into the staff here.   Upon arrival, it was empty but then started filling up. The wait staff and hostess at the counter were pleasant and very helpful.   Upon ordering we received our little flag and found our table to sit. The brownie was brought out first. Very quick this time around. Not more then 5 mins. And within a minute more, another person brought out our drink. She was gracious and very polite, making the experience so much more delightful.   Within a few more minutes, a younger waitstaff came around to let us know our food will be next. Also very polite, and not sassy.   Once again, a complete turnaround from our previous experience. All the i's dotted all the t's crossed. And not just for us, we witnessed the same pleasant demeanor for every guest that came to eat. Always someone stopping by to ask how the meal is, everything to our satisfaction. Perfect - Delicious - Very Hospitable and Friendly  4 stars is only because the restroom needed a little pickme up.   fin

The girl behind the counter was very nice with a bubbly personality. I enjoyed the recommendation of the mocha madness and on top of that, you can have veggie chicken if you prefer. Looks like I'll be stopping by here again. A warm reception is always welcomed and appreciated. This is what makes you come back for more.   The drinks are a bit on the sweet side. The island green states it has lots of green's but it wasn't like a normal kale shake. Had some zest and flavor. An interesting mix.   The other drink, Mocha Madness was a nice blend of coffee and chocolate. A bit on the icy side. And in all this is a place to check out again.

Relaxing, rejuvenating, the place to be for a little pampering of your body and mind. We all need a little here and there especially after the long weeks and months of work and kids. Both men and women can enjoy a great atmosphere and pleasant staff as they work with you to achieve what you're looking for. They also have a licensed dermatologist on staff. A little sun damage, come in. Need a bit of a boost, b12 on the way.

Bought a kitchen 5 days ago and now I'm back at the store returning it. The person at plumbing said I was the first to return it, but after explaining everything and what I did and didn't do, he stated it probably was just a defect. It still is a pain in the butt. Since I installed and then worse had an issue uninstalling it. I picked out another brand since I didn't want the same hassle I had when I purchased the giagni and picked up an American standard instead. On top of it all, the standard is more expensive then the Giagni, so the plumbing guy said when I get back to customer return just tell them if u can swap it out for the same price. This is where Asst Mgr John came into play. He said "of course". And this is what put the cherry on top. No arguing with anyone, just come in pick up and go. And without any hassles or headaches.

Purchased a mattress and bed. It's very nice to be able to walk into a store and not get hounded right away by sales ppl about purchasing something without getting a chance to look around first. I was browsing some Sofia's, then sectionals and finally made my way to the beds and bed frames. An associate was standing nearby, putting something together when I called out asking if I can get some assistance. Instead of saying let me get you someone else, he walked right over. That great, really great customer service. I asked for some information on the mattress that I was looking for. Kyle, proceeded to tell me everything about my selection and didn't have state any negative values on my choice. Just explained the benefits of my choice and how great it would be good on sleeping, only when I asked for the next model up did he proceed to tell me about it. Showing me the value in not trying to get a commission on something more, by providing me the tools that I needed to make a selection based on my needs. It was a great experience. I was able to mull over everything he stated to make an informed decision. I'm looking forward to my delivery, and their warranty for the store is perfect. 5 years anything happens, with free replacement is very satisfying.   My salesperson was Kyle, I'm sure everyone else is great as well, but I can only recommend the person whom I spoke with. Nice sales, great warranty, and a wide selection. I recommend it!!!

Impressions to the eyes always meets the mouth 2 fold. If it looks good, it's got to taste that good as well. Most places just show you a fancy picture and when the food comes out its blah. But Donna's is completely different. What you see on the picture boards is exactly what you see on the plate. I swear they just photocopy the food. And that's just the start of your foodie adventure.   You have great desserts, looks like master chef had a tournament in there. Everything so delicate and just melts perfectly in your mouth. I have to say I was most overjoyed to be able to not only see how great it looks but Wow taste it for once.

When hungry reach for Pantera's. They'll make your tummy feel good about itself again.   You know the feeling of soup, when it's made for you. Not commercially made for tons of people. That feeling is great, and that is why I'll spend a bit extra instead of a quick McDonald's fake meat burger.   Customer service is spot on. I knew I wanted the soup, but what went with I couldn't think that far. The girl at the register was quick to peep with good sides that would compliment the soup without making me over indulge. I picked the turkey avocado.   Nice cuts of meat, hearty portions to eat. The sauce was not for me, but you have to try it at least once. And the soup, we'll let's just say I felt like Mom was behind the counter cooking just for me.   Highly recommend, great atmosphere, not loud. Andindoor, outdoor and patio seating.   If you're in the neighborhood stop by.

You know who to call when you move your utilities, or when you move your furniture. What about when you need your car moved as well.   Georgiy Trucking handled my move with absolute care. I was a bit aprenhensive about having someone else haul my car, thinking I could just drive it myself. But there was nothing to be scared of. The price was very reasonable, paperwork I. My hands and a few days later I received a call that the trucker is close by with my car.   If you need your car moved, I'd highly recommend them. Not a large corporation, where you get lost in the hills. But excellent service from time of pickup to drop off.
