Great place for a pre Suns game pit stop.  This place was packed before the Suns game.  I like the short bar. My legs can actually reach the floor.  We had some drinks and ordered the Three Alarm burger and chose the wedge salad as our side. I am so glad we decided to split, the burger was huge. They cooked it to order (medium-rare) and it had the perfect amount of toppings.  The service was great. This place is definitely one of the best options for a DT sports bar with class.   They have a location opening in Chandler early next year and I cannot wait!!

I like this place. A group of us decided to try it out for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The man behind the counter was very helpful and patient with us. I had the Philly with onions and mushrooms. I loved the White American cheese. I am not from Philly and have not had many cheesesteaks, so I am not even close to an expert on the topic, but i liked what i was eating. The iced tea was good, which is becoming very hard to find.  They messed up one of our orders and made a new sandwich and also wrapped up the "mistake" for us to take with us.

What a find! I found this place thank to my trusty Yelp app. I wanted some good, spicy Mexican food and Rosita's Place seemed to fit the bill. In all honesty I was planning to go to Los Dos Molinos, but they are closed on Sundays...  You park behind the restaurant and walk around the front, dodging a few cars along the way. Walking in, I loved the atmosphere. It was bustling and full of life, but not overwhelmingly busy. We were seated at a table just past the indoor fish pond...hmmm. The service was prompt, the chips and salsa came right out. The salsa...oh the salsa, it is delish, full of flavor and lots of heat, but in a good way. I ordered the chicken enchilada plate one red and one green. My companion ordered the green chili tamale plate (out of this world good). They arrived glowing hot! The plates and food were so heat hot we could not start eating for about 10 minutes, (which allowed us to enjoy the ice cold beer).  Once the food finally cooled to a manageable temperature it was amazing!!! The flavors were spot on, the chicken was super moist and each sauce was great. The refried beans here are like crack. I was so full but could not stop eating them. Yum!  I'm pretty sure I have found my go-to Mexican spot in Phoenix.

This place is fantastic!  I got toys for my pup for less than half of what they cost in a pet supermarket. I also picked up some supplements, bowls and toothpaste for unbelievable prices.  You must purchase a minimum of $25.00 worth of goodies, but it is well worth it. Your dollar really goes far here!  I will be back soon and will bring Bronco with me so he can pick his favorite things.  Thanks Ryans!

This place is seafood heaven!  They start you off with some of the best chips and salsa I have ever had! The salsa is obviously homemade and the chips were still warm. We ordered some drinks and a half dozen raw oysters to start. The oysters were OK, not the best I have ever had but by far not the worst.  I ordered the Shrimp & Octopus in Garlic Sauce. It was to die for. The seafood was perfectly cooked. The beans and rice were some of the best I have ever had. I can't get over the beans!  My dining companion ordered the Crab Stuffed Green Chilies. They were bursting with real crab, but she did hit a few pieces of shell.  I am in love with this place. I will be back on a regular basis for sure!

This time I have the Super Cocktail. It was soooo good! Filled with raw oysters and shrimp with clams, squid, octopus, shrimp and sea slugs. The large is huge, definitely big enough to share.  This place is at the top of my list!

You can't beat Shriner's meat!!  After a visit to Short Leash dogs (they serve Shriner's meats) I had to go to the source.  I am of German decent and grew up with some dang good weenies. They have to be in a natural casing with a great flavor and snap. We got two pounds and they are marvelous, just pick them up and dip in some good mustard and you are set.  We also bought some traditional brats. These were the best I have ever had. The flavor was outstanding.  Last but not least we got some of the bacon. They will slice it to your preferred thickness and boy is it good!  The prices here are fair especially considering the quality you receive.   Go get some! (Wieners that is) :)

I stopped in for a few drinks and some food with a few friends.  We sat in the bar. The female bartender was really unfriendly in the beginning but eventually warmed up.  They have fresh squeezed juices and I love that!!  I had a delicious greyhound and ordered the Ahi salad.  The salad was wonderful. The tuna was cooked perfectly and not smothered in black pepper like you find in most places. The dressing was a ginger vinaigrette and the accompanying salad had avocado, mango, cabbage and a delicious champagne vinaigrette.  The atmosphere was nice and it was a good crowd at the bar.  One word of caution...  If you are wearing heels be careful going to the bathroom the floor by the kitchen was really slippery!

I am amazed! I wear heels...all the time.  I fall in love with certain pairs and inevitability need to have the tips of my stilettos replaced. I had been putting it off, because I thought I would be without my favorite pairs for a few days. I called The Shoe Shop. They were so friendly and said if I can in before 2pm they could fix my shoes while I waited. What??? I got there about 1:30 and (having a blonde moment) was wearing one of the pairs i needed fixed. The gal took the shoes I was wearing and the other pair to the back, where the magic happens. She came back seriously 2 minutes later with perfectly repaired heels. I could not believe it! The cost was $12.50 per pair, quite a deal when they are done this fast!  I am a forever customer, it was a perfect experience!

This is a very basic, affordable dry cleaning operation. The staff is always friendly and they send out coupons almost weekly if you live in the area. My clothes always come back great and they are done on time. One thing to note is that they do not clean tablecloths, just FYI. Parking is easy and its always quick in and out.

This place is great. I have a lot of clients that stay here and the service is exceptional. The hotel is located on beautiful Stone Creek Golf Course and has a nice pool. It was just remodeled and looks great. It is in close proximity to shopping and dining options. A nice place to get away and relax with out the Scottsdale resort prices.

Yep, You kicked my butt!  Took the pooch hiking today. For a Sunday morning this park was near empty, the way I like it. We started out on the Ranger trail...it takes you all the way to the top. This trail is not for people looking for a nice easy stroll. It is very steep in some places and covered in loose rocks. At the top the trail turns into National. This one is my fave. It takes you across the summit and has amazing views. Seeing a storm approaching we decided to find a trail back to the car...  Ummm, piece of advice, plan you trail route ahead of time.  After an hour longer than planed we finished our trek on the Kiwanis trail.  As I write this, my whole body is still recovering. It was a wonderful work out and I will be back very soon.  If you see a blond being pulled up the mountain by an enormous brown dog say "hello"!

This is one of my favorite splurge restaurants, but this review is for their Happy Hour.  I never think of Melting Pot for great Happy Hour deals, but I will now.  They offer $5 cheese and chocolate fondues as well as great drink and salad specials. The atmosphere in the bar is romantic and quiet. We were the only people in the bar for our entire visit.  The bartender was great and made adjustments to the cheese like we requested without a problem.  I think the hh hours are 4-6pm, but don't quote me on that.  If you are looking for a different happy hour vibe check out the Melting Pot.

Buono you have a special place in my heart...  This little pizza joint is an a tired looking strip mall. They have been at this location for 20+ years, that says something right there.  We sat at a booth and ordered some beers. They were served ice cold in super frosty large mugs.  We placed our pizza order and watched some football, sipping on our drinks. The guy who was waiting on us (the owner I presume) was great and brought us some complementary cheese sticks. It was a very nice gesture and they were good.  Our pizza took awhile, but when it arrived...Oh My!  We had the thin crust with pepperoni, mushroom, sausage, broccoli and onion. (see pic) The sausage was the best topping. It is the super thin slices, none of those nasty little balls.  If you have not had broccoli on pizza, try it. It is my new addition.  Everything worked perfectly together.  This place is my type pf hang out. It is family owned, cozy, has cold beer and great food.  I better start hitting the gym twice as hard cuz this place is going to be dangerous...

Really?  Came here with a big group. They do not take reservations and will not seat you until the entire party is present.  Those of us that arrived early ended up grabbing a seat at the completely empty bar and ordering a drink. The bartender was cool.  This place is obviously very family oriented and when you call ahead the first thing they ask is if you will be needing a high chair or booster seat. That's great if you are trying to find a place to take the kids for dinner.  When we were finally seated they delivered the best thing about this place...the rolls! These rolls are a carb filled dream and I hate that they kept bringing more, it just made me eat WAY too many.  We all ordered the Sirloin steak that was the special of the day. Mine was way over cooked and the sides were all lackluster.  The servers wear shirts saying that they lover their job and ours actually told us she hated hers. Thought that was funny!  I will not be going back here again unless I have to and then I will have a cocktail and rolls for dinner...  Bring your kids here and I will gladly dine somewhere else.

I used to like this place...  Went in for a quick lunch around 1:00pm. We sat in the bar (I like to avoid screaming children).  Our server was friendly and he is the only reason this place is getting two stars.  The bread arrived screaming hot and lovely.  I ordered the warm spinach salad which was supposed to be spinach, roasted garlic, prosciutto, lemon, olive oil and topped with toasted goat cheese. (sounds good right?)  My friend ordered the half sandwich and salad combo.  It took OVER 35 minutes for our salads to arrive! Really??  When I saw mine I actually laughed. It was a pile of spinach with a cold, greasy half breaded medallion of goat cheese with one clove of garlic and a small mushy ball of prosciutto. It tasted like dishwater.  The server never checked on us and I had to go find him. He took the salad and offered me something else.  I got the Mozzarella Alla Caprese. Cant screw that up right...  The tomatoes were so hard and pink they were borderline inedible. They were topped with one basil leaf and half of a mini mozzarella ball. It sucked.  I'm done with this place. If you go, have the bread and leave!

I went to Office Max to get a new router. When I walked in I went to the router section and the one I wanted was not in stock. Bummer. OK so I don't know jack about computers, so needless to say I needed some help. I was the only person in the store and could not find a salesperson anywhere. I stood around for awhile. A guy finally saw me and asked if i needed something. Of course I did, i was a blond fish out of water (not a good combo). I began asking him about what to do with this stuff, and he seemed less then interested. So I ended up buying a more expensive model. When I got to the register apparently it was not working. Doesn't Office Max deal in computers? Anyway, it took about 20 min to make my purchase. The store was clean but the staff was way less then stellar.

Fantastic Cheeseburger!  I stopped in this little unassuming diner in a strip mall in Mesa yesterday with a few coworkers. The place is tiny and we were lucky to grab one of the few booths they have. You place your order at the counter and then your food is delivered to your table. I had the cheeseburger and my coworker had the hamburger with fries. (We had to order what the place is named for.)  It took a few minuets to get the food, but you can watch them cook it while you're waiting.  The cheeseburger was divine. It had two slices of American cheese and any toppings you want. The bun was nice and soft and the veggies were fresh.  I tried some of the fries and they were really good, nice and crispy.  I am in this part of town every Sunday and I will be making this a regular lunch spot for sure!  They also serve breakfast around the clock if you are in the mood for that... If you plan on using a credit or debit card they will charge a $0.50 fee. Cash is the way to go here.

Nobody likes to hear that awful screeching from your breaks going out on the car...all I hear is money...leaving my wallet.  I stopped into Brake Masters and the guys were all very helpful. They did a complimentary brake inspection. It turned out that my front brakes were completely worn out.  I didn't have time to get them fixed that day so they gave me a printed quote and told me to come back asap.  I returned two days later and they remembered me and my car right away. I dropped the car off and they called a few hours later saying it was ready. They honored the original price quote and actually gave me a discount. They never tried to sell me anything extra.  Thanks guys for making this a great experience.

What is going on here?!?!  The last few times I have gone into Lee Lee they don't have what I want. They never have clams anymore and they didn't have the shrimp I wanted or the live Dungeness crabs. Every time I come in here I always have to go to Mekong to get what I really want. So from now on I'm just going straight to Mekong.  Get it together Lee Lee!

Love it! The staff is always so welcoming and friendly. All of my items were cleaned and hung perfectly. You cannot beat the price! They offer first time customers their first four items free and Wednesdays you get $.25 off each item. If you follow them on FB they post even more dicounts! Payment is taken when you drop your items off and I suggest paying cash to avoid the$.50 credit surcharge. This company is very involved in the community and I will always support that!

Scammers! My guy and I rented a truck from here for a quick trip to Scottsdale and back.  The girl at the counter was not very interested in customer service and did not seem to know much of anything about the company. She did not even know how to process the storage locker we wanted to empty and return the key to... The truck its self was very clean and ran fine.  When we picked up the truck we were told to return it with 1/2 tank of gas or there would be a $30 fee plus $5 per gallon. So we knew we would be stopping to fill up on the way back. The gas gage was acting kinda funny during the trip but we didn't think much of it.  When it was time to return the truck the gas gage said we had 3/4 of a tank remaining, so we just went straight back to the lot. The worker looks through the truck and everything seems fine. My guy decided to look at the paperwork before paying and it was marked that the truck only had 1/4 of a tank. We were shocked and pointed out the mistake since the fees would have been so high.  It was then we were told the gas gage was backwards... What!? The staff acted like it was no big deal and even tried to blame the truck manufacture. I have never seen a new vehicle with a backwards gas gage in my life. These scam artists had it flipped in order to trick people tired from moving all day into paying their ridiculous fees.  I am so disgusted with this place!

The staff here is always so friendly.  I went in on 4/22 for their Earth Day special. If you brought in an old product container they were giving out full size face wash in return. Even though I'm sure the staff's whole day consisted of people looking for free stuff they kept their composure.  I love their products and I really like that the company is environmentally conscious.  Nicely done!

Went for lunch today. I ordered the grilled sausage pizza made with the local Shriner's sausage. My dining companion ordered the Italia sandwich. We ordered at the counter and found the prefect table outside on the patio. The food took a few minuets to arrive, but it was fantastic. The pizza had a thin crust and very flavorful toppings. The sandwich was pressed and had an interesting sweet aftertaste we could not figure out.  The atmosphere was great and they obviously allow pets on the patio as there were a few dining with their owners.  I will be back and I will be bringing my big goofy puppy!

I just recently moved out of this complex and could not be happier with my experience. I lived here for one year and really enjoyed it. I lived in one of the units with an attached garage overlooking the pool. I highly recommend this set up. The pool is beautiful and has a beach type entry with a hot tub and grills. The clubhouse is great and there are two separate work out buildings, one for cardio and one for weight training.  This complex is located next door to The Shops at Pecos Ranch. There is even a gate connecting the two properties. I would walk next door and have breakfast on the dog friendly patios. I love this shopping center.  Montage is VERY pet friendly. I have a 120 pound pup and they were more than accommodating. There is even a small dog park in the complex.  Now for the main reason I wrote this review...  After I moved out the front office called and informed me that the housekeeper, Irma, found something that belonged to me in my old apartment.  It was my PASSPORT that contained cash and other documents. She turned it in without hesitation. Not a penny was missing. I am so impressed by her honesty.   This is a great community that employs some of the most amazing, honest people you could hope to find!

The service at this location is pitiful.  Not one person smiled or even acknowledged my existence. I needed to make a return and made it through the entire store with no interaction. Once I made it to the customer service counter the woman was incredibly rude and said maybe two words to me the entire time.  The only reason for the 2nd star is for how easy it is to return items at Kohls.   Skip this location!

This is my favorite hideout... The Fourth Floor Grille is located on the top floor of the Chaparral Suites Resort. You can choose to sit in the restaurant area or go to the bar side. I sit in the restaurant for business meetings but I really like the feel of the bar.  The food is always great I love the Chaparral sandwich and the Scottsdillian Salad with pesto dressing.  The portions are huge! This is the perfect place to get away from the hustle of OT Scottsdale and just relax grab lunch, a beer or catch the game. Parking is always easy as well.  Check it out!

Good dry cleaning at a great price.  This place is simple and good. The staff is efficient and gets down to business. They have successfully saved a few of my blouses from my clumsy stains. One tip is to be sure to pay with cash. They accept debit cards too but charge a $.50 processing fee.

I recently moved down the street from Havana and I had heard great things.  I've dined here a few times now and the food is amazing! My favorites are the Frituras de Frijoles Negros (black bean fritters,avocado dip) and Camarones Havana. So good!! The mojitos are really good too.  The only problem with Havana is the speed of service. The servers are always friendly, but things take FOREVER to get to the table. Even my Mojito took 20 min last time. I will continue to come here for the killer food, but don't come if you are on any type of schedule, starving or really thirsty...it will take awhile.

This is a great place for lunch. I ordered the Turkey Green Chili sandwich and it came with my choice of chips for $6.99. We got there just before the lunch rush around 11:40. They told us to find a seat and they would bring our order to us. We sat at one of the few tables outside. Lots of people started coming and picking up to go orders. We saw their delivery car pack up big orders as well. This place is busy! It took a bit longer than expected to get our food, but when we did it was served with a smile and looked wonderful! This sandwich is a star, there was tons of meat with the perfect amount of spicy toppings and the bread was toasted just right.  I might call ahead next time to avoid the wait... This has become my favorite quick lunch sandwich in the area...go try it!

Love the seasonal Pumpkin Porter. It's darker than I normally order, but it didn't have the harsh aftertaste.  We ordered wings to share. They were OK nothing special. I shared the Chicken Beer Bread sandwich. It is like a wrap cut into 4 pieces which makes it easy to share. I really liked it. Lots of artichoke hearts and mozzarella cheese. I tasted the Thai Hummus. It was good and spicy.  The bathroom stunk, literally.  Parking was tough and we ended up far down the street.  Good beer, good food.  I'll be back...

This place is open earlier than other breakfast spots in the area.  The food is standard, nothing amazing. The atmosphere is fun and the music gets you going.  The service is S L O W!  It was like pulling teeth to have our server talk to us. We asked for the bill after we ordered to expedite the process, but that never happened. I couldn't believe how this guy drug his feet. He payed a lot of attention to the people ordering off the senior menu, I guess he thought the old folks would tip better??  Anywho...it's a good standby but definitely not a destination...

We walked in at 9:45pm and they close at 10pm. The owners were so kind and accommodating.  We had an order of the garlic naan. It was the perfect mix of chewy and crunchy.  We decided to split an order of the chicken tikka masala with a side of rice. It was wonderful! The spice was just right and the flavor was perfect. I have been thinking about it ever since.  When we were finished we had a great chat with the owners and they brought us some honey balls. They were served cold and finished the meal perfectly.   Who wants to meet me there now? I'm hungry.

This place has great coffee. We actually bought some to take home.  The food was good and we could order anything off the menu (except soup that was not ready until 11:30am).  I ordered the Ruben and it was delicious. The cheese and bread really made it stand out.  The Monte Cristo was good too.  The owner brought us a sample of the soup when it was ready. It was spicy and definitely homemade.  This place is a little difficult to find but worth the search...  I suggest bringing cash, but they do have an ATM if needed....

Yep, I was one of those people this year, a Black Friday shopper. I had never participated in this event before and I'm not sure I would do it again. I went to Staples for the $299 laptop. I recieved the last certificate. After waiting in line again inside mission laptop was accomplished. I got the computer home and Ahhhhh!!! the screen was broken! I called the store and not suprisingly they were sold out and the guy on the pone said they could only give me a refund there was not possibility for an exchange. I was totally bummed. I went back to return the computer I spent hours in line for and that's when I met Suzanne. She was right inside the dorr and was ready to help. Her name tag saud she was the assistant manager. She looked in the computer system and found my same laptop at another Staples not too far away. She called the store to have them pull it imediatly. She told me she would personally pick it up and I could have it on Monday. I offered to get it myself so she wouldn't have to do that.  Suzanne really went above and beyond what she needed to do and I am very greatful for that. Go support Suzanne and her wonderful customer service!

I bought some ticket to the AZ Derby Dames season opener being held at the Coliseum. Doors were supposed to open at 6:00pm and the event started at 7:00pm. we arrived at 6:30pm and the line was enormous! No one knew what was going on and the lines barely moved. Over and hour later they just shut the ticket windows and it was a stamped to the entrance. I am shocked that no one was hurt or even killed.  Once inside we had to stand in the drink line for about 30 min. They had two inexperienced girls making mixed drinks and pouring beer. The tap ran dry as soon as we got to the front of the line.  This building is old and smelly. I have never seen a more poorly executed event!  I feel bad for the Derby Dames, as it was not their fault, but I do suggest that they find a new venue that can handle the amount of fans they have.

I come from a very long line of amazing German cooks.  Bavarian is the only place I have found that holds a candle to moms cooking. The food is very authentic and super tasty. The specials are always great. I prefer to sit in the bar area instead of the dining room.  I sometimes just stop by here for a great German beer. The clientele is very diverse, but there are definitely a lot of regulars.  Don't let the exterior fool you. This place is good. Hope to see you there.   Prost!!

The best people watching EVER! The Barely Balanced show and the whip cracking are great! I always get a beer and share a turkey leg (they are huge). It is a nice way to spend an afternoon, but i do suggest getting there as early as possible because traffic and the crowds can get crazy. Huzzah!

The patio here cannot be beat. It is a perfect date spot. They have small lights all over and you feel like you are no where near Chandler, AZ.  The live music they have is always good. The prices are a tad high but that is the cost of great ambiance I guess. I had the chicken enchiladas and they were very good. You can tell that the sauces are homemade and the black beans were spot on.  This is my favorite spot in Downtown Chandler no question.

For the first time in a while I was out of the house really early, too early for the meeting I had scheduled. So to pass time I decided to get some breakfast.  I had been wanting to try the Hoosier Cafe. It is always packed!  I found a table right away. The water is good (not very common). I ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage and chose biscuits and gravy over toast. DUH.  The eggs, which I ordered basted, were perfectly cooked. The hash brows were wonderfully crunchy without being burnt (like my last breakfast experience). The sausage was a patty and was good but a bit oily. The star was the biscuits and gravy. It is a huge portion. The biscuits are soft and the gravy was thick and peppery.  The servers are too cute. The whole atmosphere takes you right to small town America.   I will return!

This is a great breakfast or lunch standby in Downtown Chandler. Brunchies is owned my the Serrano's family and carries some of the same menu items.  I enjoy their lunch salads. Get the 1/2 size and I promise you will leave full.  The french fries are like fried crack. I have to force myself not to eat them, they are so good.  Service can be a little slow, but everyone is friendly.   Be sure to ask about their rewards card. You will get credit towards future meals...

I hardly ever go bowling...  We decided to go after a late business meeting and I am so glad we did!  I forgot how fun it can be.  The space here seems to be recently remodeled, new and the bar is huge.  They have great specials during the week, making this a very affordable place to have some fun!  The bathrooms were clean, all the equipment worked perfectly.  There were leagues and families having a great time.  The beer was cold and the staff was friendly.  What more could you ask for??   I just wish they could rig the system to give me a higher score...I am so much better on the Wii...

Went in to pick up lunch. I ordered the bean & cheese burrito (per Yelpers recommendation). It took a LONG time for my order to be ready, next time I will definitely call ahead. The price was awesome and the food was really good.  I anxious to try more items on the menu!

The First Round Draft in Gilbert is AWFUL!!!! I ordered a Ruben..easy right?? NOPE, I asked for the bread slightly toasted and it came looking like someone put it through a shredder (I was told that is how it looks if you order it like that). It had a golf ball-sized amount of meat on it. The waitress never came to see how things were and I finally had to take it to the bar where I was an inconvenience to the bartender. It still took a few minutes for someone to come over and by that time I was finished. So the waitress sad "OK" and turned around and walked away. The rest of the staff thought it was amusing. In these times it is not a good idea to treat customers this way. There are MANY other places to go. DO NOT EAT HERE. When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad. Terrible service and worse food! The place was empty, I wonder why...

I used to LOVE this place. In the recent months all of the staff has changed and they seem to have a huge chip on their shoulder. They are extremely overpriced and now just flat rude. It is really a shame, I have been bringing all of my cars here for years. Unfortunately I will be finding a new place with a friendlier face.

I have taken my dogs here for ever and loved the vets and staff.   My dog suddenly became very sick on a Wednesday ,morning and I knew that the office opens at 7:30am.  We got there early and waited. The receptionist opened the doors on time and I struggled to get my 100lb dog into the building.  My dog collapsed on the floor barely breathing and she tells me that the vet will not be in for another 30 min!!!!!  Why would you open a veterinary clinic without a vet present!?   I had to have someone help me get her back into the car and by this time my dogs tongue was blue.  We got to emergency and she died less then an hour later.   Thanks Prestige for the help on one of the worst days of my life. I hope it was worth sleeping in...

The service is always great at this location! I have my corporate mailbox here and do all of my shipping and mass copies from here as well. The staff always acknowledges your arrival and that is hard to find anymore. Don't let the current road construction scare you, it will be over soon!  (I Hope)

This place is spotless and well organized.  I take my company's items here every other week to be cleaned. They always accommodate my tight turn a round requirements and do so with a smile.  They remember who I am and what I need without me having to remind them. I will continue to bring my business and personal items here for a long time.   (Please support the businesses in this area during the crazy construction on the Cooper & Warner intersection. It is making a difficult economic situation even worse.)

I cannot believe I have never reviewed The Spur! The is hands down the best "have a great time" bar is Old Town Scottsdale. It is located in the old bank and the vault that once held money now keeps the beer cold. They have live music every day and never charge a cover. They serve lunch, but plan on eating dinner elsewhere. The best time to be here is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night when the Psychobilly Rodeo Band plays. They are great! If you are easily offended this is not the bar for you. The place is tiny and gets packed quickly. The good thing is that if anyone even thinks about getting out of hand they are quickly removed. This is a great place to day drink, night drink, well anytime drink. Go and see the last real cowboy saloon in Scottsdale.

Went for happy hour. They have decent prices for food (the sushi sucks), but limited drink selections. The happy hour martinis and margaritas have no alcohol in them at all. Our server was one of the worst I have ever experienced. He was in a foul mood and took it out on everyone. Even the managers were too busy drinking and flirting, they had no clue what was going on. The place seems to be a hang out for loud obnoxious girls that have to scream when they talk. I would not go back to this place when there are so many better places to choose from.

This review is for the cooking class... I was told about this class by my favorite Thai joint in Chandler. My mom and I went not really knowing what to expect. The class is held on a Staurday. When Chris called to confirm our reservation he made sure to let us know that a cab my be needed to take us home...sounds good to me. The classroom is small seating about 20 people at the most. There were mimosas waiting for us.  The class started with introductions to the variuos Thai cooking ingredients. I found this information so interesting. How do you know which fish sauce to buy, what the different pastes smell and taste like, how to grow your own Lemongrass and so much more.  We started by making Siamese Kisses. It was all hands on and really fun. The next was a fresh red curry paste. Then we compared the fresh to the store bought brand. What a difference! The Arizona Heatwave was next. So Delish. The final dish was Asian Pumpkin Custard. We tasted everything along the way and then they served us HUGE portions of the items for lunch with a Champange paring. The Chamange paring was also very informative and the pours were never ending. He was right about having a DD lined up... The staff really cares about the food they produce and will make any dietary adjustments you may need.  I really had a great time.

I order A TON of awards for my events and I always use Sun Devil. They are easy to work with and always get things done on or before the deadline. I never have to worry about things getting done, you cant ask for much more.

So I'm in the middle of a fast. It's vegan with even more restrictions.  Needless to say my dining options are very limited.  Lalibela seemed to be the perfect choice. The staff was so friendly and we were seated immediately.  We ordered the Vegetarian Exclusive even though there was only two of us.  The water tastes good here which is becoming harder to find.  The food arrived quickly and tasted fabulous. The different lentil dishes were my favorite along with the yellow peas.  The injera was very good.   The restaurant was almost full but remained extremely quite. It is a very relaxing place to dine.

Went in yesterday for a quick lunch. I have never been here before, the person I was with wanted to try it.   We were the only people in the restaurant at 12:00pm. The decor is a bit old school and the music is down right annoying.  The server was friendly and brought the water out quickly. The bread is a hogi type bun covered in sesame seeds. Hmm..I cannot decide if I liked it or not. I decided to order a simple spaghetti with meat sauce and I added one sausage. I figured it was a good way to test the quality of an Italian restaurant. They have to make good spaghetti right?  Well not exactly. The pasta was cooked correctly, but the sauce had a funky taste. The meat in the meat sauce tasted burnt or extremely over cooked. The sausage was served on a separate plate all alone. It looked a little x-rated. My friend actually laughed out loud at the sight of it. The flavor of the sausage was fantastic. It was defiantly the best part of the meal.   This place is OK, but there are other Italian restaurants in the area that I like better.

The hot and sour soup is great! The orders are ready quickly and are screaming hot. Don't judge this book by the cover. It is a good typical chinese take out joint.

This Walgreens has the busiest parking lot ever no matter what time of day it is packed! Kind of weird as the store seems empty. It is a standard Walgreens but this one sells liquor. The store is old and run down, the staff seems a bit distant.  I would never go out of my way to shop here, but it does get a pass for convenience.

Fab chips and salsa, you can tell it is made fresh. The service is always so friendly. The beers are cheap and served with frozen mugs.  There is an amazing thing that happens here...Molcajete. This dish is ridiculous. It is filled with shrimp (you can get mixed seafood too), onions, mushrooms and tomatoes in this beautiful sauce that has just the right amount of spice. It is topped with a handful of cheese and served in a screaming hot lava rock bowl. It arrives at the table bubbling and sizzling. Get it with the super fresh corn tortillas and you have a meal made in heaven. I always share it with someone because it is so much food.  The seafood cocktails here are great too!  Check out the pics I posted to see what I'm talking about.  Don't come here looking for average Mexican food. There isn't a single burrito to be found.   Go get some!!!!

THE BEST! When it comes to cheap, greasy and fast Mexican food this is the place.  It is located in Guadalupe and the sister restaurant of San Diego Bay (one of my favorites). I ordered the bean and cheese burrito encalada style. The beans are out of this world! I'm sure the amount of lard is staggering but they are oh so flavorful and creamy. They use real white cheese, not the greasy, plastic yellow kind. I could tell the tortillas were fresh. We also ordered the Chile Rellenos. The stem was still on the chile and it was oozing with cheese.  The Arizona burrito is enormous. It looked like a skyscraper was beaing eaten. This thing is massive. The salsa was good and spicy and the chips were tasty too.  This is now my go-to place when I need some super fatty Mexican food!  You can see the menu at http://delyaqui.com/DelMenu.html

We ate at the restaurant this time. You can see right into the kitchen and it was very clean.  Tried the Lengua, Carnitas and Pastor street tacos this time.  The Lengua was my favorite. So tender!  FYI if you need to use the restroom be prepared to have the staff give you a key attached to 10 lbs of heavy chain and walking outside...this might be the time to practice the buddy system...  The beans here are STOOPID good!   They serve beer too!

I called ahead and ordered Chicken Phad Thai for take out.  I walked in and they immediately knew who I was and what I had ordered (I guess wearing my name tag helped), but it was a wonderful personal touch.  The staff here is so friendly!  The take out lunch portion is huge! They put the peanuts on the side so you can add or omit as much as you like. There is a giant wedge of lemon inside the container. Use it! it adds a delicious pop to the flavor. The chicken is very tender and the sauce has a great flavor. I added a little extra spice for my taste. The noodles were a little softer than I normally like, but the dish overall was so yummy!   Welcome to Chandler TOTT's! I will be seeing you often!!

This place has been around forever...and looks like it. The night I went for dinner they seemed a bit unorganized at the host stand. We waited about 20min to be seated. The table and booth were just a little on the greasy/dirty side.  I know this is a greasy Mexican food place so I ordered enchiladas...gotta love anything smothered in cheese. They arrived after a significant wait. The enchilada sauce had a pool of grease floating on top which was a little unappetizing.  The flavor was just meh. Not horrible, but I am in no hurry to return.  The bar seemed like a fun scene with a bunch of regulars, so I might be back for some cocktails before I eat dinner somewhere else.

I am actually starting to crave this place on a regular basis. I should have done this review a long time ago.  I have had both the European and Asian style sandwiches. I prefer the Asian because of the tangy crunchy pickled vegetables. I switch between the shredded and BBQ pork. The BBQ can get a little sweet but it is good. The peppers are nice and spicy. Sometimes they are a little heavy on the cilantro for me, but I just pick some off. I also love that these sandwiches are not covered in goopy mayo. One good sized sandwich is only $2.85. That fits almost any budget. The store is very clean, although it can be a bit noisy. I normally get my sandwiches to go.  The ice cream is available in many flavors. I personally like it, but I know some people who don't.  The boba is not the best I have had.  The pastries look really good, but I'm trying to stay away from that stuff.  I always stop here to pick up a fresh baguette to serve with my steamers that I buy form Lee Lee across the street.   Overall this is a good place for a quick, cheap interesting sandwich. Remember it is cash only.

My sandwich (#5 Grilled Pork) had almost two times the meat it normally does.  Still can't beat the flavor and portion size for the price, $3.11 including tax!  The best thing to do is call ahead and walk up to the outside pickup window. It will save you a bunch of time.

I hardly ever make my way downtown. I happened to be on central and saw Fez and decided to grab some lunch.   We arrived early, which was great for parking.  Our server was friendly and prompt.  I ordered the monthly special which was the Turkey burger for $5.00. I saw the special on Yelp and apparently they do not tell you about it when you go to the restaurant. It seemed like a secret menu or something. It was very good and a super value considering all the other sandwiches were around $10.00 (Fries are $2.00 more).   My friend ordered the Rosemary Chicken Sandwich and it was fabulous!   The only problem was that there was a splinter of wood sticking out of my burger. I'm so glad I saw it, as it could have turned my mouth into a kabob. I showed the server and he was very nice about it and told the kitchen to insure that no one else could get hurt.   Overall great food!

We came in for a quick happy hour bite and cocktail.  The fish tank in the floor looked dirty and disgusting. The floor over it was so scratched you could barely tell what it was. The guy (manager/owner??) Told me that it was the world famous tank. Get over yourself dude.  We were seated in the dining room and the tables are presented nicely. They give you damp warm towels to clean your hands before eating. I liked that touch. I had the Asian Blond drink. It was good, but i could only have one (too sweet). We ordered the Dragon Roll that was $5 on happy hour. It was good. They have a female sushi chef, don't see that too often. The server was very nice. Nothing stood out for me. There are better places within walking distance.

**Review for Catering Services** I have been to many cocktail parties where Capital Grill has catered the food, most recently last night at the Scottsdale Mercedes dealership.  The servers are always incredibly professional and friendly. The food...oh the food. It is amazing! They do passed Hors d'oeuvres like no ones business! Some of my favorites include the lobster/crab cakes, lobster fritters, mushroom crostini and chocolate espresso tarts. If you need catering for a classy event THIS IS THE PLACE TO USE!

LOVE THIS PLACE!  Dim Sum is the way to go here. The food is so fresh. They actually have live fish tanks in the back with daily specials.  Back to the Dim Sum. All of the shu mai and dumplings are fabulous. My two favorites were the Spare Ribs in Black Bean sauce and the Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf. OMG! (yes I just typed that).  The Pork Spare Ribs look a little different than most pork cuts Americans are used to but the flavor is ridiculous!  The sticky rice is filled with very flavorful pork and shrimp.  Almost all of their Dim Sum is $2.18!   This place is clean and the staff is very friendly.   A must try!

Never Again. I stopped in after a late Yoga session and wanted to grab a quick bite. I had never been to Daphne's before so I was a little unsure of the ordering process. I asked the guy behind the counter (who did not say one word when we walked in) what he liked best on the menu. He just started and me and said "i don't know".  Ummm...ok. So i settle on a combo plate of falafel and chicken skewer (check out the picture). It took almost 20 minutes with no one else in the place, so I got up and asked for it to go. This pissed the mean guy off even more...  The Falafel was obviously frozen and in the shape of a sausage patty. Huh? The chicken skewer was TINY with dry chicken and burnt veggies. The hummus wasn't even good and the pits tasted old and stale. All for $9 you have GOT to be kidding me!  I really wanted to like this place cuz it's close to home, but I will never be back.

I was craving hummus for lunch. I was shopping at the mall and wanted something close...Big Fat it is.  We sat down and ordered our water and tea. My dining partner wanted to see a wine list, so the waitress brought it over. Then she decided not to return for 15-20 min! We asked to taste two different wines, the waitress brought them over and my friend decided on one. Well, the waitress then took away the tasting glass, still half-full?! This chick was in a zone. We ordered the chicken soulvaki and the hummus trio. The hummus was really bad. It was gritty and flavorless. The chicken was so dry that my friend actually chocked on it!!!  While trying to swallow our lunch we noticed that the bus boy would leave the side dishes on tables if they looked clean, for the next guests to eat off of, eeewww!!  There we no towels in the bathroom when we got there, so I told the waitress. I went back to the bathroom about an hour later and still no towels?? I told the "manager" who was just as useless.  My iced tea sat empty for quite awhile until I flagged down our space-cadet waitress.  I used to come here and sit on the patio with my dog....never again...

This was my first time in this little cafe. I was looking for something simply and affordable for lunch and Acacia hit the spot. I ordered the Spinach Salad ($6.50). It took a while to arrive at the table but it was worth the wait. The salad is huge, covering a large plate with fresh baby spinach, lots of crumbled bacon, and perfectly cooked hard boiled egg. The tomatoes around the edge were pink and flavorless, so I just pushed them aside. The warm bacon dressing served with this salad is super! when I ordered they warned me that it was spicy, and it was, but in a really good way. It was served on the side nice and warm and really made this salad pop.  I look forward to coming back, It is the prefect simple lunch spot.  Oh and the snicker-doodle cookie was wonderful!

My favorite bar on Mill Avenue. I always have a great time here. The music is fun and they play all different kinds. I love the fact that there is no down time between songs. The musicians rotate to keep the music going. Drinks could be cheaper, but oh well. I'll be back to sing along soon!

This place is SO much better than Bookmans!! Everyone was very friendly and the place was clean. I found all of the books I was looking for. They just changed their policy for trade in. They will only give you store credit, no cash. That's fine by me! it is right next to Wildflower, a bar and Trader Joes woo hoo!!

I really wanted to love this place...   Two of us stopped in today for lunch after hearing all of the good reviews.  I needed to use the restroom. The hostess handed me a dirty spatula with a key attached and said the restroom was outside around the corner...ummm OK.  The restroom has no AC. Great in the summer! We asked for a few minuets to look over the huge menu. We didn't see the server for another 10 minuets.   We ordered two things to split.  The first was the Grilled Steak Pita. It is steak with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. They are not kidding. That is all that is on it. It was really bland, but OK I guess.  The other choice was the Bleu Danube. It has Grilled turkey breast and ham blended with bleu cheese and topped with Swiss cheese (copied from the menu). It is a HUGE portion. My half had a TON of blue cheese sauce on it... too much. It was way overwhelming. It also seemed very salty. You might as well drink warm blue cheese dressing.  It took a really long time to get our food and bill. Don't go here if you are in a hurry for lunch.   I'm just bummed. I really wanted to dig this place.  Oh Well...  The dessert case looked good...

WooHoo is right!!!  This place features locally sourced items on the menu and you can taste the difference in the food.  I went in for breakfast. You order at the counter then, good luck finding a seat...  I had the Quiche Loraine with fresh fruit. AMAZING! I absolutely loved it. It was the perfect amount of food without weighing you down for the rest of the day.  I had the chance to taste their Hollandaise sauce from the eggs Benedict special and it was the best I have ever had pass my lips (sorry mom).  If you need a big greasy hangover breakfast (we all do sometimes) this is not the place to go.  If you are looking for a healthy lighter breakfast option this is the spot!

I finally tried bingsoo. I ordered mine with banana, mango and pineapple with mango sauce and frozen yogurt. The frozen yogurt is divine! I wish I would have discovered this when it was 115 degrees outside, but its still good when the weather is a chilly 80 degrees. The shop is a cute little place in a strip mall. It is very clean and inviting. This is a super tasty refreshing treat and I will definitely be back.

Stopped in for lunch and ordered the chicken shwarma plate for only 5 dollars and some change. The chicken was great , not dry at all. The hummus and garlic sauce was really good too. I actually ended up buying some hummus and pitas to take home. The staff told me they have an all you can eat lunch buffet  Friday-Sunday for $8.99. I will be back to try it. They should get a liquor license...  P.S. make sure your significant other eats the same thing. The breath/burps you get are killer! :)

Went in for a quick lunch. We decided to order two sandwiches and share them.  We ordered the Green Turkey on wheat and the Beef & Brie on Rye.  I took a little time to get our order, but we had a pint of beer that was the daily special.  These sandwiches are no joke. They are HUGE! We could have easily just shared one.  The Green Turkey was the star. It is very good. I'm still craving it. The Beef & Brie was OK. They should really add some more Brie, it was such a little portion you could barely taste it.  The bread is cut really thick and I ended up removing half of mine and eating the sandwich open faced.  Check it out!

HAPPY HOUR! This place has a killer happy hour! We stopped in after a Suns game and were pleasantly surprised to see the great food specials, 1/2 price apps. Not your typical nachos and potato skins. We had an order of the oysters Rockefeller and they were quite good. An order of 6 for just about $7.00 was a fair deal to me. They have an extensive beer and cocktail selection as well.  If you are looking for a little more upscale atmosphere with the munchies to match, check out Kincaids!

So, this time I understand the hype...  I ordered the Tree Cheese pizza to go and called in early and they had it pipping hot at our arranged pick up time.  The flavor of this pizza is outstanding. I think the best pizza here is just cheese and no other toppings.  Get it!

They run amazing specials. They also offer custom etching, to make the perfect personalized gift. I have had many gifts made for my clients and everyone loved them.  GO NOW...happy shopping!

Peanut Butter Cheese Burger!   This is a great place to watch Sunday football. They have great drink specials and tons of TVs.  On their menu they have a collection of hamburger creations from around the USA. If you eat all of them you get a T-shirt, TP and Pepto.  My guy has decided to take on this challenge. He started with the most menacing...Georgia burger.  Ready:  Hamburger with American cheese and a huge scoop of creamy peanut butter.  Gross right??!!  NOPE. It was fabulous!! The flavors were perfect together, I would actually go back to order one again. You must try this very strange combo that is surprisingly so good and cooked to order.  The buns were VERY stale. If that is fixed you would have some really great burgers.   PS Get there for the 1:00pm Sunday shirtless shot!

I went there today to check out the Hatch Chili Throw-down that was starting at 1:00pm.   We got there and noticed that is location is just like the market on Power Rd. named Guadalupe Farmers Market Too.  Then the light bulb goes off "ding"...wow talk about a blond moment. I guess the names give away the relation. Anyway..   The cook-off was no where to be seen, but they were roasting fresh Hatch chilies. I was not really impressed with the selection inside and the prices were a bit high. We ended up getting some delicious smelling chilies and fresh tortillas. (Food City has cheaper roasted Hatch chilies on the weekend).  It was a nice trip but I'm not sure it is worth a second try.

The service here is horrible!  I went in very early on Friday morning and there were pallets strewn all over the floor right inside the door, hello big time hazard. The store looked messy and there was not a smiling face to be found.  When I got to the counter the girl behind it looked like she hadn't slept in a week and she was barely functioning. I asked for a peppermint hot chocolate. Without even looking up she mumbled that they were out of peppermint. Huh? Its Black Friday at 5am. Talk about bad inventory management.  She was so rude.  Starbucks is really loosing me. I would be hard pressed to go into another one anytime soon, but never this location.

My heater went out and our landlord's maintenance plan sent out this company to take a look.  The technician that showed up was very friendly and immediately found out that our thermostat was not wired correctly. He gave me a bunch of tips for heating and cooling our place efficiently.  The heater was running so I headed off to work thinking the problem had been fixed. I came home for lunch and the house was colder than when I left and the heater was still running.  I called him immediately and he said he was on a job and would call me right back.  I waited....  I called again the next morning and left him a message.  THREE days later he called my cell and told me he was at my front door. I had no notice that he was coming so I was not home.   Too little too late.   Turns out the entire heating unit has to be replaced...

The happy hour is slammin!!   Happy hour is EVERYDAY from 4-7pm. They have half off all wine, well, and HUGE draft beers (only $3).  The appetizers are also half off. I have tried the Mediterranean Fondue and the Flat Iron Steak Crustini. I WAS SHOCKED. The fondue was good, but the star is the steak crustini. It was so good and only $4.50.   I like that the bar is completely separate from the dining room. I have not had lunch or dinner yet.   I cannot believe this place is not busier for happy hour. I think I might become a regular.

I spent the majority of my weekend here for the NASCAR races.  Now this review is extremely biased...  I was treated to suite parking, which is as close as you can get.  I watched the races from the suites, including food and drinks.  I received passes to the Octane suite, which is a 5 star restaurant and bar at the track, by invitation only.  So, yes, I really like this place!!  The grounds were kept as clean as possible considering the amount of people in attendance. The PIR staff were very friendly and helpful.  A few of the security guards were a little blurry about where some things were, but friendly all the same.  It is amazing how many people camp at the track for the weekend.  Next time I'm going to watch the shopping cart races in the "town".  This was my virgin voyage to a NASCAR event and I must say I was pleasantly surprised and would gladly go again...

I love this wine bar! It can be difficult to find, but if you park in the covered parking at the Promenade you'll be right there AND your car stays cool...bonus! My favorite spot is at the bar, but there are very cute tables that would be perfect for a romantic evening or girls night out. They have a great happy hour and always have a good $5 glass of wine (red & white) on special. The staff is great! They are easy going and say it like it is...and I love that! This is nowhere near your typical snooty Scottsdale wine bar crowd and that's why I like it. The food is also really good. I've only had a few things, but the wine lovers mac & cheese and the Parmesan cheesecake are two of my favorites!

I really like this place. My favorites are the coconut and ginger milk teas with Boba of course. I have never eaten the food, so I can't say anything about that. While I was waiting for my drink I did notice that they sell whole avocados for $3.50 each! Next door at Lee Lee they are $0.89. At least they are making a good profit! :)

Stopped in for lunch and had a great experience.   Parking is easy, right on the corner next to Crudo. I was quickly greeted by a very friendly server who took me over to the cooler to pick out my beer of choice. Ended up having a nice hefeweizen from Temecula, CA.  My friend and I decided to split the cheese board, $14. They were out of the brie that comes with it, so they upped the size of the other cheese portions. The goat Humbolt Fog was my favorite. The board comes with dried fruit (similar to the kind you find in trail mix), spiced almonds (loved these) and a very interesting apricot compote (it actually tasted like sausage, but i think i liked it.)  The atmosphere is cool and comfortable. It looks like they have some great grab-and-go options as well.  I will definitely be back to try more things on the menu, but not when I'm looking for a meal under $12...

I have been getting my hair done at Rolf's forever! I used to go to the Scottsdale location until this location opened. My stylist Randi cannot be beat. The place is relaxing and pampering. They offer complementary refreshments (water, tea, soda, wine and small snacks). When I do spend the money to have my hair done I want to have the whole experience. I always leave here very relaxed. This is a grownup salon and not a "bargain bring your screaming kids" spot. Just the way I like it! Spoil me baby!   In response to the previous review. The stylist are not inexperienced. They actually have a serious training system that consists of many levels. They have a 1-2 year formalized, paid apprenticeship and continuous training after that.

The wood saw is always out of service... The garden department is nice, but the staff is a little strange.  This location never seems to be busy, so check out times are short.  The prices are higher than "another" home improvement store just east on Baseline.  Meh.

This place is THE place to go for fresh meats in the East Valley. (the Pork Shop is good too, but a bit far away).  The brats and sausages are made in house and they have a huge variety of flavors. I really enjoyed the Chicken, Bacon and Swiss.  Besides fresh meats they carry dog treats, alcohol, cheese curds, and many other staples needed for a delicious meal.  They guys behind the counter are so friendly and very helpful.  Check it out!   I'll be back very soon!

Not my favorite place.  The bar is super tiny. They had a complementary snacks buffet advertised out front. We went in and didn't see anything. When we asked the bartender told us they burnt the food so there wouldn't be any. OK.  The decor is all neon lights and straight out of the 80's which was actually kind of endearing.  The servers were very odd, loud and kind of annoying. I'm not sure why but this place just didn't speak to me...   They do have $1.75 Miller Lights on draft for happy hour.

I love when I'm wrong! I do have to admit I had been avoiding this place ignorantly thinking it was full of greasy bar food. WOW, I could not have been more wrong! Walking in I was amazed by the beautiful bar, chandeliers and posh clientele. We were warmly greeted and chose a table in the bar area, where i did notice a great patio I will be taking full advantage of soon. The waitress told us the daily specials and we informed her that it was our first time in so she recommend the French dip. We decided to order the wedge and French dip (with prime rib) to share.  The salad was the size of a dinner plate and was loaded with blue cheese, bacon and tomatoes. Yum! The sandwich...oh the sandwich. Ok, seriously one of THE BEST dips i have ever had. No fatty or grisly meat here. Nope. Nothing but tender, buttery med-rare beef. It was unreal. You must order it and don't let the almost $15 price tag scare you, it is easily shared by two people although you will want to keep it all to yourself.  I am so excited to go back and check out the happy hour. Blue Cheese Escargot? Are you kidding me? I will be back...maybe today!!

Great place to grab a beer!  The selection is fabulous. The staff is kind aloof but friendly.  The atmosphere is very casual, relaxed and kinda hippie.  I've been twice. The first time was on a Saturday night. The place was packed for trivia and emptied out quickly after the game.  I shared the honey chicken sandwich with a friend and it was quite good. The waffle fries were delish too.  The second time was a Sunday afternoon for the all you can eat one topping pizzas for $7 per person. I got green chilies as my topping and loved it. It the pizza gourmet? No. Is it a great pizza for the price? Yes! I powered my way through 1 1/2 pizzas and took home the leftovers.  Make sure you bring your appetite!

I ordered the California burrito, Carne Asada, potatoes, cheese and pico. I added avocado and got it enchilada style.  Once I got home and looked in the to go box I was very impressed. The portion was enormous and looked and smelled so good.  The first bite is where it all went wrong...it was like eating a salt burrito. I have never eaten anything so salty!   Too bad....

Tourists....  Would love this place. I supposed that is why it is within walking distance of the Arizona Grand Resort. As for me, a longtime local, I could easily pass on this place.  We asked to be seated on the patio in the shade. Turns out only half the table was covered and it was getting hot. We saw a bunch of umbrellas in the corner not be used and asked our server if we could have another umbrella to cover the two that were roasting in the sun. She got upset. She actually said no! My cousin decided to take matters into his own hands and get one. The server came flying over and told him that was against the rules. She is not allowed to take an umbrella from another servers section. Weird as there were not any patrons in the area. Her attitude sucked. She was very lucky that I was not deciding how much to tip.  The chips were OK and the salsa was actually good.  I had the chicken enchiladas, meh. The sauce had no flavor.  The best part was hand feeding the ducks on the patio.   The prices are outrageous for the caliber of food you receive.   Skip it. Go somewhere that serves real Mexican food and provides friendly service.   Next...

Great place for ladies who lunch...  The restaurant is small and intimate, the decor is bright and lively.  I went in for lunch and ordered the Green Chili Chicken Panini. It was fabulous. They do not skimp on the indigents and even the chicken was tender and juicy.  I had the tea-tini's here awhile back and I remember them being lovely.  The dessert case was full of devilish temptations. I had no room left after my sandwich :(  Go and relax with a simply good lunch.

I had some friends in town this weekend. They were staying in North Scottsdale and I am in Gilbert. I remembered hearing that Saddle Ranch had a good hangover breakfast. It was a good middle spot. We show up and the place is empty. We could not find any staff so we seated ourselves on the patio. When the waitress showed up the first thing she said to us was that next time we are here we must tell someone we are sitting outside or we won't get served. Well, we would have told someone if there was someone to tell...  We ordered our drinks and they took forever. Our waitress (Ms. Personality) came back to take our food order. We all had some sort of egg dish. 3 people in the group ordered EB's and asked for runny yolks. When the food finally came out, their eggs we like hockey pucks. Ms. Personality said that is how they come...whatever.  I had the Huveos Rancheros. My eggs were done perfectly so no complaints there. The food was still completely forgettable. Portions are huge but who cares when the food sucks.  The manager came by and we told him about the eggs and he said "thanks for letting me know". That's it nothing beyond that.  The girls that work here look like someone put their clothes through a paper shredder. A little ridiculous for 9:00am.  Bypass this place and go to The Breakfast Club across the street!

I love the happy hour here!  This is a cute wine bar in Chandler. It is on the smaller side, but cozy. We sat at the bar and ordered our drinks. They have great drink deals during happy hour that starts at 2pm!  The food options are $2.00 of all Tapas and 1/2 off the bruschetta menu. I love their bruschetta. There are like 6 different flavors to choose from. You get to pick three different kinds and you get two of each. One order is huge and its only $4.50. I do suggest that you stay away from the salmon bruschetta, not very good. My favs are the brie with apples and almonds, and the artichoke hearts with goat cheese and red pepper pesto. Yummo!  I have had dinner here once awhile ago and it was good, but I have not been recently. I stick to their happy hour, it is a ton of food!  Enjoy!

I have been looking for a replacement salon for awhile and found this location with the help of my fellow Yelpers!  I had my color appointment with Alana. I have naturally dark hair but have it colored blond. When I normally get my roots touched up the color is never quite right. Alana knows her stuff and made my color look great, no brassy orange shades in sight. She also dried and styled my hair for no extra charge. I will be coming back on a regular basis to keep the fact that I am not a real blond a secret :) Thanks again!

I love this place!! The deja blue martini is FANTASTIC!! The happy hour cannot be beat. It is 50% off EVERYTHING from 4pm-5pm 40% from 5pm-6pm and 30% from 6pm-7pm.  The bartender/owner is great. I always sit at the bar, I have not experienced bad service like mentioned in other reviews. The salmon nigri is the best in town. It is so fresh.

Went for happy hour which is from 4-6pm. You get 1/2 off everything with a "smiley" face next to it. I ordered the Berry White martini. It is a blueberry martini, very similar to the Deja Blue at Pearl, pretty good. It had some disgusting bumpy berry in the bottom of the glass...eeww.  We ordered the Salmon nigri (1/2 off). The flavor was OK but it was really soft, aka mushy. Then we ordered the Eating Nemo roll. My dining partner and I took a bite and almost lost it. Something was wrong. We sent it back.  The crowd was a weird mix of ridiculous cougars and families. Weird scene...   We asked for our check and left to find some place better.   Go to one of the other many sushi bars in the area.

I really wanted to try this place for lunch yesterday.  After looking it up on Yelp from my blackberry. I was sent to the wrong intersection because the map provided on Yelp was incorrect.  I tried to call the restaurant at 12pm and it is a recorded answering system where you have to press a number to speak to someone. I pressed the number corresponding to the hostess stand. I was then told to leave a message for the hostess!!  So I called again and pressed the number for a manager. A woman answered and I told her that I could not find the restaurant and wanted to know where they were located. She had no answer and put me on hold! A guy then picked up and at this point I was very frustrated and I asked "where are you?". This guy said "what do you mean where am I?". I didn't care where this dude was I just wanted to find this restaurant. I gave up on this joke of a manager and hung up. I proceeded to go to Zammi's Pub for lunch and it was great.  I will never attempt to eat at Red White and Brew again.  Your are a restaurant, at the peak of lunch ANSWER YOUR PHONE!

Really like this store... They have a great variety of health products and healthy food options. The staples I buy here are coconut water, all my veggies (they are cheaper than Fry's), wine (great prices), frozen fruits and veggies, meat (although I wish they had a bigger selection, especially more seafood), and I really like the bulk department.  They have double ad Wednesday's where two weeks of items are on sale at the same time. You can score some great deals, but be prepared to fight the slow moving crowd.  Do not go on a Wednesday if you are in a hurry.

This is my favorite place in Downtown Chandler for lunch. The atmosphere is clean and simple. I enjoy sitting by the huge front window watching the world go by. They have a tasting menu available for lunch for around $11.50. It includes: Spring rolls Papaya Salad (my obsession) Choice of an entree (I like the Phad Thai and Yellow Curry) Dessert. They also have a full menu to order from. It is a great deal. The staff is always very friendly and accommidating.   Check it out!

I really like this place...  Taking the advice of Yelp we stopped in on our way through downtown.  We were immediately greeted as we walked in. I told the staff it was our first time in and asked which sandwich was the best.  Following the recommendation I ordered the Crackerjack, cracked pepper turkey and melted pepper jack cheese with lettuce, tomato, onion and Russian dressing. We also ordered the Godfather, cappicola, salami, pepperoni and melted mozzarella on garlic toasted bread.  Let's take a moment and show the bread some much deserved love. It tastes fresh with a chewy center and crisp exterior covered in sesame seeds. You could put a shoe on this bread and it would taste great.  I really enjoyed the Crackerjack. The Godfather was good for a few bites, but too rich for me.   I can't wait to come back...  Great choice for lunch downtown for a very fair price.   Unless you are completely starving, share a sandwich!

Good chowder!  We ordered the seafood chowder and shared a fish & chips. The chowder was screaming hot and filled with all kinds of things from the sea. I liked that it was not overly creamy. I would get a bowl instead of a cup next time. The fish and chips were also good. The batter was a little thick, but the fish was perfectly cooked. Their fries are good and crispy. I think they season them with sea salt. It was strange that we were the only people in the whole place from 11:00am -11:40am. I will be back for some of the nightly specials they offer.

As good as it gets!!  I found this little gem by purchasing a Groupon for some of their farm fresh products. I have come back numerous times now and I refuse to buy dairy or eggs anywhere else.  The eggs are fabulous. The yolk is a beautiful bright orange with a flavor that those mass produced grocery store eggs could not even come close to matching.  The farmers cheese is made fresh and comes in great flavors. The garlic & pepper and chipotle are my favorites.  The salsa and hummus are also quite tasty.  I buy whey for my dogs it is so good for them, it is only $1.00 and they love it!   There is a little area behind the store where you can pet the animals.  Support this farm and provide your family with farm fresh food and the education about where food actually should come from...

I can't say enough about this store and the beautiful farm it resides on...  I come here at least twice a month for all of my dairy needs; milk, butter, yogurt, farmer's cheese, ice cream, eggs and savory items that change often. The eggs are so delicious.  The Mootique has so many adorable farm themed gifts. It is a wonderful place to take children. I always get a kick out of the cute unique things they have here.

It's so clean!   I finally made it to Mekong Supermarket. I am a loyal Lee Lee fan, but I really liked this place. We received a sample of curry as we walked in. It was good! I ended up buying some.  It is so much cleaner then Lee Lee and the smell is not quite as strong.  The staff is very easy to find and more then happy to help with any questions you may have. The produce department is arranged beautifully. There is a $0.99 bin where you can get some pretty awesome deals. The meat and seafood department was very well kept and had a wonderful variety to choose from. They had live crayfish. I haven't seen that in a while...   My only grievance is that there is not any where near the selection that Lee Lee has. The sake choices are very minimal. :(   All in all I will be back.

I am not a resident here...(still have a few years to go) but this place is awesome! I was lucky enough to visit and have lunch with some of the residents.  The facility is absolutely beautiful and the staff are some of the friendliest people I have ever met. All of the residents I met told me how much they loved living there and everyone seemed so happy! They allow redident to have pets (under 30 lbs) wich I thought was really cool. They even have Happy Hour in the on-site bar! The food was great and the activities they offer residents are amazing. The day I was there they were setting up for Oktoberfest and beer tasting. Nice! If you have a loved one that needs a friendly, safe and fun place to live I would recommend you check this place out!

This was my first Pho experience...  When we went in we were promptly greeted and seated. We told our server that it was our first time (*blush*). She was really cool and recommended some traditional dishes. I chose the rare steak with flank Pho and my friend had the chicken Pho. It Arrived very quickly and it was steaming hot with a beautiful side plate of goodies to add. The server even mixed up our sauce for us. The servings are huge and a good value for the price. I took half of mine home.  I will be back! Go Pho!

We just randomly decided to have lunch here. To be honest I was not expecting anything spectacular, it is in a hotel in Tempe. We walked in and were the only people there around 12:30pm. I thought "Uh-Oh" bad sign. We sat on the lush patio and the service was prompt. The employees were extremely friendly and offered their opinions on what was best to order. We started with the baked brie. It was good and served with a bunch of fruit. For our main course we had the roast beef sandwich. It was FANTASTIC. Everything was fresh and delicious. The frys it comes with are completely addictive covered in Parmesan and parsley. It was a great getaway from the noise and crowds of Mill Ave. I will be back soon for lunch and would love to try the dinner.

The food here is good! We came in for lunch and decided to order two things to share.  All of their sanwuches are available on bread or Boxty (a huge potato pancake). We ordered the Irish Club on Boxty. It was HUGE! It was filled with corrned beef, roast beef, ham, bacon, tomatoes, and some screaming hot jalapenos. It was soooo good! one order could definatly feed two hungry people. We shared half and took the rest home. The other dish we ordered was the Cloudy Day (as it was one outside). We ordered it on bread for the purpose of dipping. It was filled with roasted beef on grilled sourdough with mashed potato, grilled tomatoes, cheddar, and Swiss cheese and served with Smithwicks Au Ju for dipping. The Au Ju was really tasty. The beef was good with no fat and not stringy at all. I was pleastly suprised by the food here. They serve breakfast on the weekend and I will be back to try that. My only complaints are that they do not have any outdoor seating and the service was a bit slow. They were haviong some serious issues with the draft beers and that may have slowed things down.

I have been coming here over the years for various injuries and maintenance. Dr. Mioni is great and very easy to work with. Dr. Rago is one of the most kind people I have ever met. Every office visit is very relaxing and professional. I would highly recommend anyone to AZ Chiropractic. If you have pain they will fix it!

This place is amazing!  We decided on the 7 course meal without the wine paring.  We started with vodka martinis and I asked if they had blue cheese stuffed olives and the waitress said she would make some, fresh!  The olives alone were amazing. The best blue cheese I have had in a long time.  The courses were all fabulous. I think the wild boar bacon was one of my favorites. I also loved the red cabbage jelly and curry soup. The prawn dish was a little disappointing. The prawns were overcooked and chewy, but that is my only complaint.  For dessert we requested something savory as we are not really into sweets.  Wow, we made the right decision. They brought us a cheese plate with the best cheese I have ever had on it. There was a Humbolt Fog goat cheese and the star of the dish, Epoisse Du Borgogne. I have never tasted anything like it. The waitress wrote down the cheese names and told me where I could purchase it.  I love it here. It is a wonderful experience. We spent 4 hours (we told them there was no rush) a lovely laid back dinner and drinks.   Go, savor and fall in love!

The food here is really good!  We sat outside on the patio. I liked the set up and the server was very friendly. We ordered our cocktails and took our time ordering. The waitress was very accommodating and not at all pushy.  We decided to order two sandwiches and split them. The first was the Athena (hot pastrami) Rye bread with marinated slaw, melted Swiss cheese & French mustard. The other was the Madrid (prosciutto & Turkey) Multi grain bread, sweet mixed greens, basil pesto aioli, tomato & homemade mozzarella. We ordered fries with one and slaw with the other.  The Athena was really good, it was kind of spicy and I really liked that. The fries were homemade and had a sprinkling of cheese on them.  The Madrid was really good as well. The slaw however, had a lot to be desired. It was soupy and nothing special.  This is a great place to have a relaxing lunch and just enjoy the great weather. (Hurry before it gets too hot!)

I finally made it to this spot. We sat at the bar. I must complement the purse hooks. I love them, they have a clasp and are easy to get to! (I know guys probably don't understand but it is a big deal to the ladies) We ordered the cottage pie pasty and the rosemary chicken, and split them. The cottage pie was my favorite. The red wine gravy was really good, totally comfort food. The rosemary chicken was good also, but be sure you really like roasted red peppers. I loved the $3 Car Bombs and cheap mixed drinks. The beer list is huge. Sitting at the bar you get to see them make everything. The desserts looked fantastic but I was stuffed. The staff was great and very helpful since it was my first time. I will definitely be back.

Great customer service!  This is where I usually buy my undergarments. I bought a bra and after a few times wearing it one of the straps broke.  I took it back to the store. I didn't have the receipt, so I was assuming they would not be able to take it back. The gal that helped me said it would be no problem at all and gave me store credit. She was so nice and never even questioned the situation.  They provide complimentary fittings and the dressing rooms are beautiful.   PS. Ladies, try the new Incredible Bra. It really is incredible!

Yummy!  I just had lunch here with two dining companions. They each ordered a Big Willy. I ordered the pierogi's (only available on Wed, Sat & Sun) with sauerkraut. It took a little time to get the food, but we just walked around the mall until it was ready. They had football on TV (too bad this is a Steelers joint). They were out of the natural casing hot dogs, which was a bummer, but the owner was really cool about it.  The pierogi's were outstanding. They came with 6 on the plate and covered with sauteed onions and my requested kraut. The hot dogs were huge and looked really good.  I will absolutely be back!!

This is a charming weekly farmer's market in Downtown Chandler. It is every Thursday from 3pm-7pm. There is beautiful, fresh, local, organic produce and eggs. There are also homemade Tamales, salsas, honey, olive oils, vinegars, jams and breads. They have live music and lots of crafts to buy. I bring my dog and mosey around. Bring cash, most places do not take plastic. After shopping you can head over to one of the local restaurants for a happy hour drink or snack. A nice way to spend a sunny afternoon.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!  We had a coupon from restaruant.com.  We went at about 1:30pm and the place was empty.  We were immediately greeted and seated. They brought over water with cucumber in it. I love that.  We ordered the Bot Chien (pan-fried rice cake). It was wonderful. It is served with a yummy soy dipping sauce and it really hit the spot.  We ordered the Chicken Curry and the Tamarind Shrimp.  The Chicken Curry is fabulous! It is a bight yellow broth with sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, onions and chicken. I think I might become addicted. I did have to add a little chili sauce...I like things spicy.  The Tamarind Shrimp looked beautiful and was served with the heads on. This dish is kind of sweet, so I dipped them in the chili sauce. The only complaint I have is that the shrimp are not cleaned (aka full of poop) and they are very hard to peel. I think I would try something new next time.  The service was spot on the entire time!  The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated. The bathroom was spotless and actually smelled good.  They have Happy Hour form 3-7pm and again from 9pm-close, Monday - Friday. With half price booze and starters. I will definitely be back to try that!  I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship...

I went for happy hour today (3-7pm). We ordered Lychee martinis that were $3.00 each. They were made with a good vodka and Lychee liquor with two Lychee fruits on a skewer. They were strong and great!  We ordered the beef and vegetarian spring rolls ($2.00 each). The portions were HUGE! The beef is the way to go, the veg was a little bland compared to the beef. I really like this place. It is a great spot to stop before shopping at Mekong.  Rock on Boca 7!

So disappointed!  My guy and I love Thai (rhymes, cool).  We ordered the traditional Phad Thai with shrimp and the Ruby Red Curry with chicken.  We picked it up and brought it home. The first thing I noticed was that there was no shrimp in the Phad Thai. We called and they said that we were not charged for shrimp...ok but I ordered shrimp and that is what I wanted.  The worst part should have been the easiest. The white rice that accompanied the curry was beyond mushy. It didn't even look like rice. It completely ruined the entire dish for me. The curry flavor was OK but I could not get past the super mushy rice.   Looks like the hunt for good Thai take out continues...

Very professional company.  When it was time to move I began shopping for movers. I found some great rates but sketchy customer service.  I contacted Just in Time and their prices were a bit higher, but I could notice the professionalism right away.  The guys that showed up were great. They moved efficiently and barely took a drink break.  We had a ton of product boxes to move and they helped organize it.  I would definitely recommend these guys.  Ask for the Yelp discount. Thanks!

Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon and the place was  a ghost town. We were just there for drink sand ordered vodka sodas with lime. The bartender was nice but went MIA often. The club soda tasted very strange, almost sweet. Our drinks were served in red plastic cups while the couple next to us got glass...not sure what that was all about.  The particular day I was there it was FREEZING inside while it was in the 90's outside. The barely clothed bartender told us she is NOT ALLOWED to wear a jacket over her uniform.  This repulsed me as I see who I assume was the manager (a big, buff, tattooed guy) strutting around the restaurant.  Places that put sexuality before employee comfort disgust me.

I was pleasantly surprised by this market. I was expecting something along the lines of a Food City.  I walked in and was blown away! The prepared foods area is amazing. They have many varieties of freshly made Aguas Frescas, shrimp and fish ceviche, salsa, fresh tortillas, and so much more!  I took home some of the shrimp cocktail they were sampling for $1.00 per container! The bakery is awe inspiring. They have tons of baked goods at exceptional prices.  The produce was beautiful and inexpensive. The meat and seafood sections were very clean and had a great variety.  This is my Mexican version of Lee Lee. (Ranch Market smells much better).  Go here...Eat Shop Enjoy!

Tasty and good for you!  The girl behind the counter was very helpful and let us taste any flavors we wanted. I decided on the pomegranate made by Pom. I topped it with dark chocolate chips. It was divine.  My friend got the cocoa with almonds.  The only thing I would do differently is get the smallest size next time. The medium was just a little too much.  The yogurt here is very tangy and they have tons of information on their product available for you to read.  I like this place.

I have been going to this place since it was Riva's. The been & cheese burrito enchilada style cannot be beat. The chicken burrito is good too. It is a little place with a drive thru that is always fast. Be sure to get the red hot sauce, it is fantastic! They are open 24 hours. The breakfast burritos are good and everything is HUGE! Bring your appetite...

This place is great! I just sold them an extra car I had been trying to sell privately for 2 weeks.  The process is so SIMPLE. It took 30 minutes for them to appraise the car and make an offer that is good for 7 days. They offered $1000.00 more than any other dealer we took the car to.  Everyone is super friendly and there are not greasy salesmen to be found.  We returned 5 days later to take them up on their offer. We dropped off the paperwork and the car and left for about 30 minutes. By the time we got back everything was done! We signed a few documents and they gave us the check. (You don't have to buy one of their cars either). I have never had a better experience at a dealership.   HIGHLY recommended.  Note: I did not BUY a car from them I only sold them mine, but I'm sure they would make that just as easy!

I was so disappointed!  Petit Fromage is now located inside Delicious Dishes. There is only a small case of cheese. I asked a staff member which of the blue cheeses she preferred and she wrinkled her nose and said "eww I don't eat blue cheese". HUH?? Needless to say I was ready to walk out. I asked which of the cheeses were made locally besides the one brand of goat cheese I recognized and she began looking around to find the place of origin.  These people don't know anything about the cheese and the selection is awful!

What a deal!  The staff is so friendly and the service is super quick.  Their Express Pitas are an amazing value! They are huge (the chicken beast and gyro are the best) and come with fries or a really tasty Greek salad for $5. That's right 5 bucks! Trust me you WILL be full and still feel good about what you ate. The chicken shawarma is a bit dry, I like the breast better.  The hummus is very good. We have come in and just bought pitas to go, they are so soft and chewy.  Happy Hour is all day and they have a hot wing eating contest. I'm not sure why the bar isn't busier, but hey, more room for me!  They always have off the menu specials that sound wonderful.   This place is nothing like the other Big Fat's and I'm completely OK with that. It has a quaint, local feel.   OPA!!

Not good.  We sat at the bar. There were maybe two other patrons in the restaurant. It took about 4-5 minutes for the bartender to even notice we were sitting there.  Ordered the happy hour margarita pizza. Not much flavor and honestly with all of the other area restaurants specializing in pizza I would NOT order it here.  The vibe is boring and old. Definitely won't be rushing back...

Bev-Who?  This place rocks!  The prices are awesome and they normally have coupons in the Sunday paper.  Last time we were there they had a rum tasting. The staff is very friendly, although sometimes hard to find.  I think it took us 2 rum tastings and 20 minutes to pick out a Tequila for a party...the selection is huge!   Prost!

Great little place.  I ordered the grilled pork and Chris D. got the pork belly. They were both delish. I think I liked the belly best.  They lady behind the counter was very helpful in explaining things (our first time with Filipino food). She also gave us some watermelon to go with our lunch. As we were leaving I asked about the special pork they had that day. She gave us a taste and it was melt in your mouth good.  We actually had leftovers, I made pork fried rice with the next day.  Thank you for the outstanding customer service.

This place is truly a hidden gem in Chandler!  Inside the building they have tons of educational information and a really cool display of live indigenous animals. There are snakes, scorpions, lizards and more.  Outside is really cool. They have miles of hiking trails and plenty of wildlife to watch. The have a large lake where you can fish (with the proper license of course). Don't have a fishing pole? No worries you can borrow one from the center.  The staff is so knowledgeable and friendly.   Go check this place out! You won't be disappointed!

Not impressed at all. This place was empty on a Friday evening and there is a reason. The decor is cool, but everything else is lacking. I ordered the "Dumps" dumplings, that were deep fried and store bought) and I felt sick the rest of the night.  Next...

Happy Hour every day!  I stopped in before going shopping in the market. It's never a good idea to go grocery shopping or sober for that matter...  Tip - DO NOT order the Mojito. It's awful. Sick to the beer and wine.  I ordered the chicken satay, expecting some mediocre semi-dry chicken. Boy was I wrong. This is THE BEST chicken satay I've ever had. It was juicy and obviously marinated in a curry and served with a cucumber salad and a peanut sauce. You get 4 big skewers for $5. We actually ended up getting another order.  I have not had a full meal here, but the satay will bring me back!

Great Yogurt spot!  The store is always sparkling clean and the staff is friendly. They are always ready with plenty of tasting cups! :)  The fresh fruit is cold and fresh.  They have a loyalty card and you get a stamp for each yogurt you buy (Tuesdays are double stamp day)! Your 11th one is free.  They send out discount texts and Facebook posts too.    The fact that I want more flavor choices is the only thing preventing 5 stars.   Aloha!

I found GREAT oysters in Gilbert!!!!!  Seriously I did.  I am still on cloud nine about my recent discovery. I received a coupon in the mail for Zammi's and it said they had oysters on the half shell. I love oysters and cannot find good ones in AZ. We decided to give it a shot.  This place is so cute and cozy inside. It is a stark contrast to the building and surrounding neighborhood. (a good thing).  We were warmly greeted by Marie and she explained the menu and said the oysters were fresh and good. We ordered a dozen raw oysters and they arrived split onto two plates (good attention to detail). They were ice cold and sooooo good! the cocktail sauce is homemade and will totally clear out any sinus issues you may have. I did not find one piece of grit in the entire dozen!  We also ordered the Zammi's broiled shrimp. They are stuffed with Philly cheese and wasabi and wrapped in bacon and topped with spicy BBQ sauce and served on top of a cucumber slice. I was skeptical at first but the flavors in these little morsels are amazing.  You have to try this place. They have happy hour for 3-6 i think and its $1.00 off all drinks. Their pizza looked good and I want to come back and try the po-boys.  Yeah for Gilbert!!!!

Tasty, fast lunch option. The staff at this location are always extremely friendly even if the line is out the door. I do suggest you get here before 11:30am or after 1:00pm to avoid the crowds. I always get the turkey and provolone on wheat Mike's way (without tomatoes).  They slice their meats fresh and they are generous with the toppings, but sometime add too much oil...so keep that in mind.  I think Jersey Mike's has become my favorite fast sub sandwich chain. They may be a bit more pricey but they beat the snot out of Subway and Jimmy Johns when it comes to service and taste.  Happy Lunching!

Super cute, local spot in the Scottsdale Airpark. I met a friend here who works close by and wouldn't stop talking about this place. It's kind of hard to find I drove right past it the first time. It has a very homey feel, it's super clean and the smells will make your tummy talk from the moment you walk in. They have quite a variety of food to choose from. I heard their fish and chips were awesome and I heard right. They were lightly battered and crispy without being greasy. The prices are very reasonable and the owners are very friendly and passionate about their business. The only thing I would alter about this place is some outdoor seating, they are located in a beautiful courtyard. I did hear they are looking into it.  Please go check it out and support this cute hidden local spot!

This is the newest location for Valley Women for Women. The lobby is beautiful and they have an on-site lab. Going to my yearly exam is never my favorite thing to do, but we do what we have to right?  I have been seeing Dr. Belisle for years. She is absolutely fantastic. She always remembers me and never rushes through the exam.   The main reason I would never go anywhere else....   Dr. Belisle saved my mothers life.  I could never thank her enough. My mom was having some problems and other doctors just dismissed them as nothing. Dr. Belisle took it a step further and found my moms cancer. Without this diagnosis I know my mother's disease would have become life threatening. My mom has been cancer free for 5 years and it is all due to the diligence and medical skills of Dr. Denise Belisle.  I will forever be in her debts!

This place is so disgustingly dirty.  The staff was incredibly rude and the food was insanely over priced.  There is no excuse for how nasty the staff was. I will NEVER return.   Not much else to say.

This place is great. My guy and I went in on a weeknight around 9:00pm and we had the entire place to ourselves. The staff was very attentive and treated us like kings. The food was very good and inexpensive. They have great prices on drinks and $0.99 sushi. We had the Sake Sushi, Caterpillar Roll and Alaska Roll. Everything was good and presented beautifully. The server brought us complimentary miso soup and edamame. The sushi chef gave us some squid salad on the house.  The atmosphere is great, I really like the decor.  We will be regulars...

Beautiful course! Lot's of water... Now I'm more a bucket of beer instead of a bucket of balls kind of gal, golf is not my best sport by any means. We had our annual golf tournament here and everything went perfectly. The staff was wonderful and really worked with us to ensure our event was a success.  This is a lovely location for any event!

$5 for a shampoo, cut and style??? Yep.  The prices for services here are amazing.  My only complaint is that it took almost one hour to get a simple trim. The student has to have everything approved and sometimes the instructors are not around.  The atmosphere is not spa like at all, but when I'm in need of a simple service this is the best bang for my buck.

I'm in LOVE!  I came here after purchasing a Groupon...  We sat on the patio enjoying the great weather.  Our server was great and we quickly found out he was the Owner/Chef.  They were offering two liquors that evening and one was a Vodka filtered 5 times through white rose petals. There are no mixers so it was served over ice. It was THE best vodka I have ever had!  We ordered the Artichoke and Salami pizza and the Portuguese style mussels to share.  The owner recommended the pizza since it was our first visit. It was WONDERFUL! I couldn't get enough.  I normally do not like tomatoes with my shellfish but I was easily convinced that the Portuguese style were the best, so I gave in and boy am I glad i did!!! I was actually eating the tomatoes out of the broth (if you know me that is amazing!).  We had parked our car right in front of the patio we were sitting on...  While the car parked in front of us was leaving they crashed into our car and began causing a scene...(long story short)  The owner stayed with us until the police arrived and made sure everything was taken care of properly. He was so amazing and sincerely concerned about our safety.  We owe him big time!   Thanks again and I will be back very soon!

This is one of the best accidental finds I've made in a very long time.  We were headed to Cornish Pasty and walked by this cute little place and decided to stop in for a beer before going to dinner.  There were only a few guys at the bar. The server was very friendly and accommodating.  Then, I find out that Mr. G is a Denver Broncos fan. I'm in LOVE!  I finally found a Bronco's bar in AZ!  The food is good. I had the Philly Cheese steak. The meat is super tender, lots of cheese and fresh crusty bread. Quite tasty!  The pizza is good too. My boyfriend won't stop talking about the wings.  Needless to say we never made it next door...   You really need to stop in and check out this family run, super cute place. Grab some grub and a beer, just don't take my seat!

I had two tires split...yikes! I headed to Discount right as they opened and stood in line with a few other people. I had called earlier to make an appointment, which did not make any difference in the order I was helped. It was just first come first served.   The staff was very friendly and had two new tires on my car in a flash. I was in and out within 20 minutes!!

I don't really get the draw... The food is OK but, the line at lunch time is atrocious!! There are even times where there is literally no where to sit.  Today I had the grilled cheese (had been craving one). It was full of arugula and fresh tomato but the cheese was not very noticeable. If I order a grilled cheese I want cheese to be the star. I also ordered a cup of mushroom barley soup...that came with no mushrooms? I asked the server and she even seemed perplexed so she went to check with the kitchen. She came back and said I had the right soup...it was a veggie soup with barley. Good but NOT something that should be named after an ingredient that was nonexistence.  Meh.

Pineapple Chili is my favorite flavor...  Well, it's actually the only one I've tried because I like it so much. It is so fresh with chunks of pineapple and flakes of chilies roasted in house. Its cool and refreshing with a zing of spice.  Check it out if you are downtown Chandler.  Perfect treat on a hot day!

I go out of my way to shop at this Fry's.  I have always been a fan of Fry's grocery stores. There are two locations that are much closer to my home, but I prefer to shop here.  This store was recently renovated and has a more upscale atmosphere compared to the other stores in the area. It is always clean and the staff is very friendly.  This store doesn't ever really fell packed, and I like that.  Happy shopping!

Check this out...I JUST HAD A RUBEN FOR BREAKFAST!!!!!  I saw the article about this place in the Tempe newspaper. We were already heading to the Healing Field at Tempe Town Lake9/11/10 and wanted to stop for breakfast. We had the dogs with us so choices were limited. My boyfriend went into Stan's and they let us sit on the patio with the pups.  They serve their entire menu all day. I'm not a huge eggs and bacon kind of person so I love having something a little different in the morning.  I ordered the Ruben and allowed Kelly the waitress (who was fabulous) to choose the side.  The food took a little while to arrive.  When it did...Holy Cow!!!  My sandwich was huge and she brought all three sides so we could taste them all. That is great customer service! My favorite was the slaw, then potato salad.  The food was fabulous and the staff was more than accommodating. The owner stopped by our table and chatted awhile.   I will no doubt be back. Thank you so much Stan's for the wonderful start to my day!

Super disappointed... I thought this was going to be a large farmer's market, definitely not the case.  There were about 20 booths, most selling craft type goods, not produce or food. It is located in the parking lot of a strip mall.  I wish this market was better because I live so close, but I still ended up at the Old Town Farmers Market to buy my fresh veggies... Maybe it will get bigger as the season progresses...let's hope!

Dissapointment...  That was the feeling I left with.  I have been wanting to go here for awhile. We finally made it in the other no\ight for a cocktail. the decor is dark and romantic. They have movies in Spanish plaing on a big screen in the middle of the dining room. The bathroom set up is strange. They are very clean and had really good smelling candles in them. The sinks are in the hall outside the bathroom. It's kinda cool and I'm sure many conversations happen there. Were the dissapointment happed was at the bar. It took a minute for someone to acknowlede us.  I ordered a vodka soda. That was not what I got. I ended up with the flatest vodka tonic I have ever had, it was nasty. My guy got a really flat beer. It took awhile for the bartender to comeback and check on us. He replaced my drink for a vodka soda, but again it had no bubbles at all.  To add insult to injury there were some drunk typical Tempe turds trying to start a fight with my boyfriend for absolutly no reason.  Maybe I'm finally too old for Mill...

This place is really great. I have only come here after spending some time at the dog park down the street. Why? Well by then my pup is tired and Sofrita allows dogs on the patio (not just outside the fence).  Be prepared to be on Spanish time when you dine here. The service is slow and no one is ever in a hurry. This can get annoying if you aren't expecting it. They have great sangria's, served in huge glasses with lots of fruit. The chips and salsa is really good! The chips are made fresh and so is the mild salsa. If you want it hotter you're going to have to add some hot sauce.  The tacos are quite doog and a steal at $2 a piece (less during HH I think). My favorites are the pork and potato...stay away from the chicken, dry and boring. Definitely a great place to relax, take it slow and enjoy an afternoon on the patio.

YUM!  I had breakfast here last weekend. The patio is a great place to enjoy the fresh air. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. I started with the organic bloody mary. It was not my favorite. The skewer had cheese on it that tasted like refrigerator, yuck.  The meal was much better. I ordered the veggie omelet and switched my side to the sweet potato tots based on previous reviews. The tots were delish. They were crispy and not greasy. The omelet was perfectly cooked, I asked for no oil and they made it perfectly.  I will most certainly be back!

Oh no....I have a new addiction in Downtown Chandler.  This store is absolutely beautiful. It is Christian themed, but it will appeal to anyone. I bought an amazing bracelet and some great gifts. The prices are very fair. They have jewelry, clothing for all ages, home decor and so much more. I spent an hour looking at everything.  They just opened on 12/3/10.  Check it out!

Tanzy is quickly becoming my favorite place... The atmosphere is beautiful and classy without being stuffy.  The signature drinks are handmade and oh so good. I love the cucumber lime martini for a refreshing summer cocktail.  The food has impressed me every time. The first night I dined here they had a scallop appetizer on special and it was out of this world good! The scallops were cooked perfectly (which is not easily done) and had a beautiful salt crust on top. This item is not on the standard menu, but they do have a scallop entree that I hear is just as amazing. Another must order item is the hand pulled motz (mozzarella). You can choose to have it made in front of you or in the kitchen. Absolutely opt for the show at your table. They form the motz right there and you can choose the salts and oils to accompany it. It is damn good and fun to watch. The beef carpaccio  is ok. Standard but good.  Come here for lunch, happy hour, dinner or a sip before or after a movie at iPic.   I can't wait to try their brunch (bottomless mimosas included!)

THE best Lox & Bagel for only $7.50! This cute little joint does salmon right. They cure their own salmon and serve it with a good amount of cream cheese, a toasted bagel, slivered red onion, a carrot and daikon mixture and capers (they need to add a few more capers to each order, i only had 4 on each half and I really like those little buggers).  They have happy hour all day so you can accompany your breakfast with a $5 mimosa. There is no table service, so walk in and order at the register, then your food is delivered to your table and if you're lucky the chef himself will come out and chat about his food. The service here is never warm and fuzzy, but they get the job done and I always leave happy.

The subs here are GOOD!  This was my first time dining at Plant Sub. When you walk in the menu is a little overwhelming. There are so many choices! I recommend checking out the menu before going.  I decided on the Green Turkey (turkey, bacon, guac, salsa, cream cheese, onions, sprouts and tomatoes). I asked to have it on wheat bread and the staff told me all of their bread is whole wheat...nice!  They handed me the Queen of Hearts playing card (fitting I know) and that's how they found me when delivering my sandwich to the table.  All subs here are served hot unless you ask for it cold. I normally don't like hot subs but these are ridiculous. The bread is what really makes this place stand out. The fillings are delish too, but really...it's all about the warm fresh bread. My goddaughter (very picky eater) inhaled her sandwich and said she never wanted to go to Subway again, that this is her favorite sandwich.  Seating gets a little tight during the lunch hour. A few tips...  Tuesday = $2.50 any Turkey sandwich  Thursday = $3.00 any Veggie sandwich  They also have a stamp card to earn a free sub.   Go get some lunch!

I cannot believe I have forgotten to review BLD! I am definitely a regular here. I'll start with Breakfast... My boyfriend and I eat here at least once a week for breakfast. He always orders the Green Chili Tostada and the few bites I've had were delicious!! I have ordered many things...the open faced sandwich is delightful, the waffle has bacon in the middle, the short rib eggs bene and the breakfast burrito. I normally go back to the waffle because it is so good! I don't normally eats sweets but the bacon with syrup is prefect and for $5 (if you order the waffle as a side) is a great deal! Lunch is another time of day you can find me at BLD. I love taking clients there and the food is always spot on. You must get the Prosciutto & Fried Goat Cheese salad. SOOOO GOOD! I can't really order anything else... Happy Hour is one of the best around. Great prices with unique food options (no chicken wings and potato skins here). Get the Ahi (See pic). Trust me! Had dinner here the other night and our server suggested the Braised Short Rib Pasta. It was unbelievable in a prefect Pesto sauce (see pic). The patio is beautiful and allows dogs. They actually have a dog dinner availble for your pooch.  GO HERE ANYTIME. You won't regret it and say "hi", I'll probably be there.

I had an amazing facial here!  The space is clean, inviting and relaxing. Park in the lot south of the building, it is less crowded.  After an hour of pampering my skin was glowing!  They offer many of different services including laser treatments. I will be back for some more aggressive treatments to fix up my flaws (not that I have any)!  Anyway, the staff is very professional.  Before or after your treatment go next door for some great Thai food!

This place is casual and good. The best seat in the house is at the bar where you can watch all of the food being prepared. It has a neighborhood feel and has a lot of regulars. The Drunken Chicken and Shrimp is my absolute fave (be specific about how spicy you want it). The Shrimp won ton soup is great also. Everything is made in house even the crab puffs, which are yummy.

I'm about to say something BIG!  I have found the best pizza ever! Yep, that's right...  *Mamma Spinato's "Signature" Fresh Spinach Pizza*  (See Pic)  I literally dream about this damn thing. It is heavy on the garlic so plan ahead. I can't even describe the flavor, but it is out of this world. I have only had the personal size, but I'm sure the bigger sizes are just as good if not better.  I have come in here for lunch between meetings and sitting in the bar is a great spot to people watch. This location also has a great private room for meetings, its actually quiet and they are hooking up the appropriate media. I WILL be booking meetings here just so I can have this pizza.  Go try this pizza...TRUST ME!

So Good! Thanks to Yelp I found this hidden gem right by my house. It is located in a sketchy strip mall in Chandler. We went in on a Sunday for dinner and we were the only non-asian people in the whole place (Great sign!!). We were quickly greeted and our drink order was taken. There were ladies making fresh dumplings right at the counter. We HAD to order some! We started with the Hot and Sour soup. I was one of the best I have ever had! It was filled with tons of veggies, tofu and egg. It had a great kick and tons of flavor. We also ordered those fresh dumplings, we chose the pork,shrimp and chive variety. They were amazing!! Our server mixed up a special sauce for dipping that was really tasty. After reading previous reviews we also got an order of the beef pies. The arrived screaming hot (let them cool a bit). One bite into the chewy dough and the rush of broth and tender meat enters your pie hole (pun intended) you are going to be very happy. The meat was so tender and flavorful. We really wanted to order some noodles, they make them fresh in house, but we were so full they are going to have to wait until a return trip which I see happening in the very near future. Go here, support these great people and enjoy amazing food!!

Great breakfast spot! Get here early on the weekends because it fills up fast. The employees are very friendly and the food is really good. I ordered the Nova Lox Platter consisting of Smoked nova salmon, tomato, onion, cucumber, capers, cream cheese & a toasted bagel. It was divine! The portion is huge and the cost is very fair ($10.95). I also tasted the Country Benny with Poached eggs, sausage, biscuit & white country gravy. Amazingly light considering the ingredients. The noise level is pretty high, but it is a great place to start your day. The patio looks great, but it was too hot when I was there...

I had a really refreshing experience here...  Refreshing? Yes.  I stopped in today and asked if they stretched boots, the nice man said "yes" so I went out to my car to get the shoes.  After taking a look he so honestly informed me that the design and suede material of the boots would make them very difficult to stretch and he told me the exact reasons why..zipper, material, etc.  It was so nice for him to take the time to talk to me about my best option and not just taking the boots and stretching them with possibly bad results.  I will return here each time I am in need of shoe repair just because of the man's kindness and honesty.

Love this salon!!! I have been bleaching my hair for years...(shhh, don't tell). I was used to the burning and itching of the bleach, I had no idea there was any other way...until I met Stephanie. She introduced me to the concept of organic hair care and I promised to give it a try. I was nervous about switching salons; I have had some horrible experiences... I gave it a shot and could not believe what happened! They put the color on my hair and I felt...NOTHING! No itching, no burning...Nothing! It felt like a deep conditioning treatment. There wasn't even the typical hair color odor. I was amazed! When I was done my hair had never looked better. I received so many compliments on the color. The price was even less than I had been paying at a traditional salon. The salon is beautiful and so relaxing.  You must try Verde. I PROMISE you will not be disappointed.  Tell them Anna M. sent you!

Love this new spot in downtown Chandler!  The atmosphere is great and I love the high quality decor. The staff is so friendly and really on top of things.  On a side note...I think they only hire very good looking men...and I am so OK with that!  I've been here for lunch and the owner gave us a taste of their famous Lobster Bisque. It was delicious!!! Big chucks of lobster in a rich creamy broth.  It was so good I ended up ordering a cup of it with a house salad ($7 on the lunch menu). What you get is not a cup, but a BOWL of bisque. It was a very yummy and filling lunch.  I have also been to C&W for happy hour. it is for 3-6pm and they have good specials. There are lots of tv's for watching your faveorite sport. I will most certainly be a regular!  BTW they are now serving their full menu.

It's Burger Monday!  That means $7.00 burgers all day at Coach & Willies. The burgers are cooked to order and include cheese, lots of cheese!  This was one of the better burgers I have had in a long time. I got the pasta salad as my side and it was unexpectedly delicious!!   Great way to start the week!

It just keeps getting better! Last night I had the Bacon Crusted Mac n' Cheese.  HOLY CRAP!! It is amazing! One of the owners told me they actually make their own pasta...hello!  The pasta was perfectly cooked and topped with a jalapeno bacon and green chili crust.  I just reheated my leftovers and it was just as amazing.   This place is going to make me fat! :)

Worst service ever! We sat at a table on a Saturday afternoon and had two servers walk past us multiple times before we actually had to say something to get any acknowledgement. We ordered drinks, 2 waters, 2 iced teas and two mixed drinks.  After a while one water and 2 teas showed up. The ladies dining the tea had a hard time telling it was even tea and one of them had a curious floral taste to it. They were just horrible, watery and barely tea. When we told the waitress she said "oh yeah i've heard that complaint before, we just have bad tea here". WHAT?!? The mixed drinks were bad too.  We left without ordering anything else and went across the center to TQLA for much better drinks and service.

59 minute delivery! I thought this place was supposed to be freaky fast... I ordered a sandwich online at 1:01pm and it did not arrive until 2:00pm. Called 40 minutes in and the girl said they are always understaffed and overwhelmed. I don't even really like JJ's but I needed delivery on a busy day at work. NEVER AGAIN. Oh and the cucumbers were missing on my sandwich too.  Fail.

I may be a little biased...I really don't care for this type of restaurant.  I went in for breakfast expecting something completely different. I ordered the Anaheim Panini and my guy ordered the Chicken Apple Sausage Panini. The food took a little time to come out and the restaurant was FREEZING! Once the food arrived we asked for forks and got a very strange look form the server...about 5 minutes later we had our forks. The Anaheim was actually pretty good but the Chicken Apple sausage was straight from the freezer section of your grocery store, yuck! It was so sweet and did not pair well with the rest of the ingredients at all.  I'm not sure if we will ever return, there are just too many better places for breakfast downtown...

I used to shop at this store when they were in Chandler and I was so bummed when they moved to Scottsdale. Then fate stepped in...I moved to Scottsdale too! Some things have changed for the better in the new location. The staff is always so sweet and they remember me each time I go in. They have everything from affordable costume jewelery to unique pieces I've never seen before. They also carry a small but very cute collection of clothes, hats, scarves, etc. They also have a great selection of purses.  I most recently bought a $30 watch that looks like its works $100's. I get so many complements and its great quality.  This is a great place to find the perfect gift...and they have lots of BLING!

All day Happy Hour on Sunday! I just moved within walking distance of North and I could not be happier.  I have been a couple times now and love it! Their house wine is great and during HH even their reserve bottles of wine are half off! The chef's board is very good and filled with very thin sliced Genoa salami and a spicy version. It also comes with two cheeses, a golden raisin compote, spiced nuts, bread and the best damn green olives I can remember eating. Seriously, these olives are great, order a side of them. Trust me. They have a daily special pizza ($8 during Happy Hour). The pizza is thin and crispy without any char, which I like. The crust is big and fluffy with a sprinkle of course salt. It actually reminds me of a delicious soft pretzel...crazy huh? On to the mains...I ordered the house-made spinach tortellini. WOW! It is not a huge portion but plenty to feel satisfied without ending up in a food coma. The cheese filling is so light and buttery. You must check out this simple dish. I was also lucky enough to taste the scallops. I am a huge scallop fan and I am quite picky about them. These are the best I have had in a very long time. Perfectly cooked over a mushroom risotto. OMG! Go here and get some great food and a glass (or bottle) of wine, but don't take my seat.   PS. They allow dogs on the patio!

Had a wonderful experience! Went in for lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with a clean and open design. I really like the living art on the wall... We sat on the patio and our service was wonderful. They have happy hour from 11-6 everyday! I had the traditional and watermelon mojitos and they were amazing for only $5! Now on to the food...We ordered three rolls (see picture) and a Teriyaki Chicken bento box (see picture). Everything was presented beautifully. The bento box was good, I really like the octopus/squid salad that comes with it. The miso soup was really good as well. The real stars here are the special rolls. The first one we had was the Tiger. It was more of a standard roll, good but nothing too exciting. The second was the Truffle Steak. OMG, this was delicious its topped with rare beef, truffle aioli and fried onions. My absolute favorite was the Spicy Chandler. Spicy tuna, spicy crab, avocado, masago, romaine lettuce, wrapped in soy paper with spicy aioli and it was ridiculously good! It is a must order when you eat here.  I am a huge fan of this place and I cannot wait to go back!!!

Friendly, fast service. You order at the counter, but a server came to our table to take our drink orders. They have decent cheap margaritas. They also have a chip and salsa bar that is self serve. The salsas were cold and tasted fresh, some with quite a kick. The chicken they grill here is good (you can watch them do it through the glass kitchen wall), very flavorful and juicy. The rice and beans were ok too. This is not a fancy place (plastic plates and utensils), but it is clean, good, quick and inexpensive. It also seems a bit healthier then your traditional Americanized Mexican food drowning in cheese and grease.  Kid friendly, easy parking...check it out.

My guy and i decided to try this new salon that just opened a couple months ago. The man and woman working there are so friendly! We were chatting the whole time. As soon as we sat down they offered l us water. The chairs are great and the water color changes as you sit there, kinda cool. The pedicure includes a hot lotion and rock message that is awesome!  Great place, we will be back!

Great lunch spot in the Scottsdale Airport! Zulu is the perfect lunch option in the Airpark area. The restaurant is open and clean with a great view of the planes coming and going. It is quiet enough for an important business lunch or just a casual lunch with friends.  I can't seem to get myself to order any but the chicken wrap. It is wonderful with perfectly cooked spicy chicken, avocado and black bean hummus. For your side you must order the sweet potato fries. They are worth it, crunchy and seasoned just right.  The prices here are very fair and the food is really great. Enjoy!

Consistent. This place delivers a great product every single time I'm here. The eggs are always cooked perfectly, and I love that! The wait on the weekend can get long so get there early. They only take reservations for 6 or more.  They have a cute patio that allows dogs, but I normally end up sitting inside at a booth. The service is very friendly and they remember us every time we come in. They have an awesome Oink Bloody Mary, that includes a strip of your choice of bacon (they have 7 kinds). The mimosas are nice and refreshing too. I normally order the Pancake Combo, now i do not traditionally like pancakes or sweets at all, but they do them right here. I always have them add fresh blueberries, YUM! It comes with that perfectly cooked egg and the meat of your choice. I really like the sugar cured or jalapeno bacon. The Bacon is not very thick and could be a little more impressive since that is the whole theme of the restaurant, but its still good.  I have also ordered the Pigs in a Blanket. The portion is huge! It is three full sized pancakes (with blueberries for me) stuffed with a sausage link, served with your choice of potato.  I really like the people and food here... check it out.

This is my favorite store hands down. I love their clothes and they have fair prices for the quality. If you join their loyalty program you get tons of coupons and discounts.  Every time I have been here the service is impeccable. The staff is never pushy and always ask my name (and call me by my name after that) and I love how they pick out items you might like. Its like having a personal shopper at no additional cost.  A+

This spot gets it right! The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and sparkling clean. You order at the counter and then choose your seat. I was SO excited to find out they are dog friendly...it gets better...the patio is not only beautiful (see pic) but it's AIR CONDITIONED! We had breakfast with the 130 puppy and it was very comfortable even with it being 100 degrees outside. Now the food. The first time I had the special quiche. When it arrived I was concerned about the small portion, but once I tasted it I realized great food can come in small packages. You can order more than one if needed, but one was just enough for me. It was served with fresh spinach. The second time we dined, I ordered the Bagel and Lox. It is served as a sandwich, I normally like mine served deconstructed so I can build it. It comes with a delicious caper cream cheese. I ended up taking the top of the bagel off and asking for extra cream cheese to eat it open-faced. The coffee here is good and local. They really make an effort to use local products and you can even buy some great items at the register.  They deliver breakfast, lunch and dinner. I hear they are getting their liquor license in early July. That will make this place 6 stars for me!

Open for lunch! My first time here I want with a group of girls from the office. Upon walking in the place is super cozy and welcoming. The owner greeted us right away. He began telling us about the restaurant and gave us great suggestions about what to order.  We had two pizzas and a sandwich to share. The steak sandwich was ridiculously good! The pizzas were just the right size for one person and the crust was awesome. The homemade olives are so good as well! They even have unique sodas in glass bottles. I am loving this place and the price for lunch is great too!  You have to check out this hidden gem, but don't take my seat!

The girls and I decided to have a nice dinner out and I had been wanting to eat at Crudo for a long time. I had only been there for happy hour before, which was awesome. We showed up for our 8:45 reservation and decided to sit at a table in the bar area. The hostess was very kind and accommodating.  We were informed that all food was 50% off that night...score! We ordered a nice bottle of wine and decided we would each get the four course tasting menu in order to taste almost all of the dishes. Our first course came out with no problem...then things went downhill fast. 40 minutes after finishing our first course no one had come by our table. Our water, wine and plates were empty. We all tried to get the servers attention with no luck. (I understand the restaurant was busy, but at least stop by and fill our waters, heck we were even going to order another bottle of wine.) He just blatantly ignored us. I got up to notify the bartender of our issue and he swiftly told me that it was busy because of the food special and to just wait...quite abruptly I might add.  So I went to the sweet hostess and she said she would try to get someone in to help us.  In comes Maureen. She was AWESOME! After finding out how long we had waited she immediately went into the kitchen and appeared with our next course. She offered a glass of wine to each of us to make up for the wait. I thought that was very thoughtful and really helped save the evening.  The food here was wonderful, which is the reason they are getting 4 stars. My favorite courses are the Crudo and the cooked. The grilled was lacking for me. (we tried all of each category).  Thank you Maureen and the hostess (wish I had her name) for making our evening awesome after some major bumps in the road.  Lesson of the day: If you are going to Crudo to eat a meal, sit in the dining room!

Disclaimer: This is the only laser hair removal salon I have ever been to...  With that said, this place is great. They are very professional and the place is spotless. There is not much pain at all. They get things done quickly which I appreciate since I am in a very compromising position... My only complaint is that every time I have an appointment I end up waiting about 15 past my scheduled time before I am called into a room.   Looking forward to the new hair-free me!

As far as fast pizza goes, I really like Papa Murphy's. This one even has a drive thru so you can call ahead and just pull up to the window. The staff is friendly and the store is clean. You can go inside and watch them build your pie. I really like that I can pick up a pizza and cook it when I'M ready instead of waiting for delivery or having it sit and get cold.  The ingredients are good quality and they always have coupons online, making it a very affordable option when you need something quick.

A wonderful new option for lunch in Scottsdale! I stopped in on their second day open and my experience was flawless. It was a Thursday and the special was Italian Beef with Au Jus. I had to try it. I ordered the half size for ($4.25) and it was plenty. It arrived piping hot with melted mozzarella on really great Italian bread. The Jus was the best I've had outside of my ma's kitchen and the sandwich was perfection. The beef was so tender with no bits of fat. The restaurant is small and clean. The owners are the real deal. They were making sure everything was just right.   I am so excited to have this wonderful option for lunch with a great price point ($4.25 - $9.95) and amazing food. They have daily specials that are awesome.

I LOVE this park and drive from Scottsdale just so my pup can play here.  This park is huge, which is good considering I have a 130 lb ball of energy. I hardly ever see poo piles and there are buckets and water hoses everywhere. They even have a drinking fountain for the dogs and a kiddie pool to cool off after a rigorous run. 99% of the people that come here are great. You will run into the snobby one every now and then, but hey they calm down after a bit of slobber and dog hair clings to their fancy clothes. There is a separate section for small dogs, but I see alot of them in the main big dog area too.   Over all great place!

False advertising makes me angry.  Looking for a brunch spot on a Saturday morning we chose Daily Bistro mostly because on the website they advertise bottomless mimosas. I then looked on Yelp and people mentioned BOGO mimosas, which would have been OK too.  We arrived and were seated right away, the decor is chic and clean and the hostess seated us away from a huge table of screaming kids (I loved that).  I had my heart set on some fresh squeezed (also advertised on their website) OJ and a little bubbly. I told the server to sign me up for their bottomless deal and she just stared at me. They DO NOT have bottomless mimosas or even BOGO for that matter, $6 each is their "special price". I ordered one that was a good ratio of bubbly to orange juice concentrate. Quite annoying. Ugh...  So on to the food. It took quite a while to come out, but when it did...it was hot! I ordered the burrito and my dining companion had the Benny. I really like the flavors of the burrito, it even had re-fried beans in it which I actually liked. I had hashbrowns as my side and they were literally swimming in a pool of grease, I had to send them back for the much better breakfast potatoes.   So all in all the food is good. Service was OK, and the cocktail situation stinks.

Stopped in for a much needed coffee on a cold day. I was headed for the National Memorial Cemetery which is right up the road. The decor is super cute and the delightful smell of baked goods fills the room! I had a regular cappuccino. The service was friendly and the coffee was great. Well done.

The best fish tacos I have ever had!! My friend and I split and order of fish tacos (you get 2 huge ones per order) and the Seafood Salad. The tacos are incredible and very filling. We probably didn't need the extra salad, but the Seafood Salad was also great! We chose the Mahi as our fish, blackened with two different dressings on the side. I barely used any dressing the salad was so good on its own. It comes with 3 large shrimp that were cooked to perfection. The price is on point with the quality you receive and the portions are large. This is an order at the counter joint, which I typically avoid for business meetings, but the staff was AMAZING! They gave us all the details on the different options and  made great suggestions. They were busy so try to get there before 12pm.  They are opening a second location on Scottsdale & Shea in a couple weeks which is great as that is much closer to my office!

This place is way to expensive for the product and service they deliver. I dropped of two simple women's blouses and the bill was over $13! The gal behind the counter when I dropped off and pick up seems miserable! She refuses to make eye contact and is impossible to chat with.  I will be looking for friendlier service with a much more reasonable price tag.

I don't like sweets.  Well, at least not the kind I have had before. LGO has now ruined my waistline with their absolutely amazing baked goods! I live close, which makes this even worse...  This place was unreal...it really was like being a kid in a candy shop. The gelato was fabulous (peach being my favorite). Then...oh then...you turn the corner to see a room FULL of every sweet treat you can imagine! I had no idea where to start, but very easily ended up filling my plate with some of the most beautiful and TASTY items. I must say that I cannot stop thinking about the warm, soft, chewy English muffins made fresh right there. I thought I knew what an English muffin was...boy was I wrong. Why can't they all be this heavenly???  Thank you to Cole who always made sure my glass was full...much appreciated!  This event was spectacular...did anyone else notice that LGO employs some serious eye candy? A treat for my belly and my eyes...who could ask for more??  Bravo!!

Great spot very close to the sports arenas downtown. The food here is simple but well executed bar grub. The staff is always attentive. If anything does go wrong they are very quick to fix it. (we had and order of fries arrive cold and they were promptly replaced with some of the best screaming hot, crispy and perfectly seasoned fries i've had in a while.   The people watching here is great as well. It is right behind a light rail stop so that keeps the entertainment coming.   Stop in for a cold beer, All American eats and great service!

This spot has only been open for one week and they are off to a great start! We were immediately greeted outside the front door and told to walk in and meet the hostess who would assign our table number. So you go in, take your place in line and then the hosts will come over and give you a sheet of paper with you table number. We were given menus and deciding what to order. The line goes right past the bar and the bartender wasted no time offering us a drink while we waited. He then mentioned that the seats at the bar are first come first served and full-service. So we quickly got out of line and bellied up to the bar. The beers looked really great, but being a work day, I just stuck to water. My friend and I decided to split the Poblano burger and an order of the fries with Green Chile Queso. It took about 15-20 minutes for the food to arrive, they split the fries and queso, but we had to split the burger ourselves...no biggie. The queso we got was quite red in color i think it was the chile con queso as opposed to the green chile version we ordered, but it was delicious anyway. The burger was cooked the way we asked (med-rare) and it was stacked high with toppings and the bun held up to all of the juice. I went though about 4 paper towels during the meal, which to me is a good sign when eating a burger.   I am excited to go back and enjoy some adult beverages with some of the best fries I have ever had!

I have only been here for happy hour...and I LOVE IT! You can order a nice glass of wine for $5 and the appetizers...oh the food! The brussel sprouts over corn grits are absolutely perfect! I truly crave this dish on a weekly basis. I have also had the pate which is done very well and I really like the pickled onions they serve with it. The first time I sat on the patio and had great service, the second time I sat at the bar and the service had a bit to be desired. The bartender was so busy flirting with a set of very drunk girls...it took longer than it should to be acknowledged when we arrived.  I heard they just started brunch...can't wait to try it!

I cant believe I haven't reviewed the Pig yet... This is a fantastic little bar. They serve only beer and wine which is fine with me. There are plenty of games to keep you occupied and they are a great way to make new friends as well. Happy hour is all day on Sunday with a huge selection of $5 wine and $3 beer. The meat and cheese plate is good. I love the Shriner's sausage they use. That being said do not come here for a meal as the options are VERY limited.  This is a place for drinking. *Park in the back...it is much easier to get out when you finally decide to leave.

I love this place! It is comfort food at its finest! The prices are very reasonable and the food it great. I like to pick up a par-baked pasty and take it home to bake ...it only takes about 20min in the oven to finish the baking. You can get any pasty to-go this way, just give them a 5-10 min heads up and it will be ready to pick up when you arrive. The pate is also good, be sure to order it with a side of their house made mustard, YUM!

Look up charming in the dictionary and you would see a picture of Mr. Thai, the owner Oh and her husband (the chef).  My mom lives very close by and we happened to see the sign about a new Thai restaurant to the street so we decided to give it a shot.  We went in at about 8:30pm on a Saturday night and we had the restaurant to our selves, although Oh told us it was packed an hour earlier.   The restaurant is clean and has great lighting and decor. While we were reviewing the menu she brought us a basket of still sizzling rice chips that were so good! We decided to order the Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. Both arrived hot and beautifully presented.  The Pad Thai was full of flavor and the shrimp were plentiful. The Yellow Curry was just what I was craving, the chicken was tender and the veggies were cooked perfectly.  I will say that nothing here has much heat to it, so ask for added spice if that is what you like.   They are waiting on a liquor licence (either beer & wine or BYOB).  They also have lunch specials for $6.95...  Come support this adorable place run by the sweetest couple that really care about their customers!

I am so excited to have a Hula's in Scottsdale!!! The new location is beautiful with the entire front wall opening up to the street for optimal people watching. The drinks are nice and strong just like the Central location and the menu is very similar. I had the Spicy Shrimp Caesar Salad today and it was delish. The portions are VERY generous and the staff is great. Hula's is a breath of fresh air in Old Town...go there NOW!

Taco Tuesday here rocks! Yes, the tacos are small but they are DELISH! They offer, salmon, beef (my two favorites) and pork for $2 each. They come on fresh, wonderfully chewy corn tortillas and you can order as many or a few as you like. They also have specials on margaritas made with house-made sweet & sour. I almost always get heartburn from margaritas, but not these, they are quality. This deal is only offered in the bar, but it lasts all day and night.   Their happy hour is also a great deal and I love the steak salad for lunch.

Just finished up having lunch here for the first time.  We walked right up to the counter with no wait (11:30am on a Tuesday) and the staff were incredibly helpful in explaining the ordering process. I went with a custom salad and added all kinds of goodies. The lettuce was crisp and fresh, i just wish it was cut into smaller pieces.  The Italian dressing was really good and automatically comes on the side! The portion sizes are huge and a great value for just over $7.00 including unlimited toppings. The patio was perfect and the salad was delivered to our table within minutes. Next time I need to try one of their pizzas which looked great too!

I was one of the lucky people to enjoy Burger 21 on their opening day 7/21! The options are endless and they have something for everyone. Juicy burgers? yep. Chicken burgers? yep. SEAFOOD burgers? YEP! Salads, dogs and shakes also have real estate on the menu. I decided to try something different so I went with the Spicy Thai Shrimp burger, lightly-fried (not greasy) shrimp burger, lettuce, tomato, sriracha aïoli, sesame Thai slaw, pure sriracha, toasted sesame bun.  This thing was ridiculously good. Great amount of heat and big chucks of shrimp in the patty. I also ordered some fries (do not come with your burger). There is a sauce bar with about 10 options, some are very interesting. Toasted Marshmallow  and apple cider sauces for sweet potato fries. My favorite was the Thai Ketchup on the regular fries, but everything was good. The service was great and the prices are very fair. My office is close so I will be back often, much to the dismay of my diet plans...Welcome to Scottsdale Burger 21!

Love this place! The trifecta sauce at a heat level 2 is perfection. I like that the shrimp still have the head on. A pound will fill me up and its only $12! The Cajun fries are really good too. The space is very large and there are some TVs. Be prepared to get messy, its finger lickin good! Haven't tried the BBQ yet, but i plan to soon...

So good! I had lunch here and the food was great. The restaurant is beautiful and the views of the golf course are lovely! We started with a couple of sushi rolls. The Seared Salmon roll was smokey goodness (avocado, crab, masago, tamago and bonito flake)! We also had the Angry Tuna (chipotle rouille, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado and sesame) which was really great too. Everything was very fresh and beautifully presented. (I love the metal chopsticks) For our mains we ordered salads. I had the Toro Chopped Salad and added chicken. This salad is good! They mix in chayote, fava beans, queso fresco, lots of panchetta, roasted corn and tortilla strips.  This is a fantastic restaurant in north Scottsdale if you are looking for great food and beautiful views.

They Cater! The Great Australian Bakery catered a breakfast event for our organization. We had 100 people in attendance and everyone LOVE the food. They had sausage rolls, bacon & cheese quiches, Spinach & feta quiches, veggie pie, and a full assortment of their delicious baked treats. Their staff is so friendly and did a great job interacting with our guests. I would highly recommend them for your next event. I love that their food is unique and delicious. We all get tired of the same sandwiches and doughnuts. Cheers!

Cute decor! I used to come here when it was Forge. They have done a great job closing in the space and creating a fun atmosphere.  We ordered the La Burger. The bread this thing is served on is amazing and baked right in house. There is very little meat and cannot be cooked to order, comes cooked through. The chipotle aioli had a nice kick. Our sandwich was missing the promised arugula stated on the menu.  The side salad was nice but a touch too acidic.  The staff was friendly, but obviously still green since they had only been open a few days.   I would head back to try more things  off the menu... Or maybe just for that amazing bread!

Today was the official opening of Chestnut. I meet some friends for lunch. When you walk into the big open space, you order at the counter, receive a number and find a table. Our drinks (green tea) were delivered promptly.  I ordered the Green Goddess salad that had rice noodles, kale, swiss chard, cashews, toasted coconut and a spicy Asian dressing. It only took about 5-10 min to receive our food and the service was always with a smile. The salad was very good...maybe better if they would have had more greens and less noodles, but still light and delicious. My friends ordered the Chestnut Chop salad which looked good and the Lobster Roll, which looked AMAZING. This is not the mayo-loaded-gut-bomb you have come to expect from lobster rolls. I didn't even see any mayo. I can't tell you about the taste because my friend refused to give up one bite and finished the whole thing! lol  The patio is great. There is an adorable flower shop inside as well.   Welcome to the neighborhood Chestnut, you will be seeing a lot of me!
