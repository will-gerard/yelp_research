Ahh, Hillstone.  Consistently delivers quality service and food.   The biggest disappointment is having to wait for a table on a busy weekend night, but it is always worth it!      A few recommendations:  - Call ahead for reservations for dinner  - Order a glass of Mi Sueno (yum!)  - Try their California roll.  I know it sounds crazy but it is by far the BEST California roll you will ever have.  I typically hate Cali rolls but this one is legit.  Who knew a place like Hillstone would have great sushi rolls?  They make theirs with real crab and the best part is that they don't skimp on the crab to rice ratio.  Okay I'm drooling now...  - Thai steak salad is delicious and very filling.   - Although a little pricier than some of the other items, try their Hawaiian Ribeye.   Ordered mine medium rare and it was "OMG yum" worthy.  - French dip is also a must try.  Perfectly prepared every time.  Last night I ordered it and they seemed to have changed the cut of their fries (typically shoe string, which I prefer).  - Order the ice cream sundae for dessert and share it with friends.  We like to flip the bowl of ice cream, nuts and whipped cream over into the main dish and drizzle all of the hot chocolate on top.  Perfect for sharing and always a great way to end a delicious meal.

This place is a home run every time!  Always a nice spot for a date or intimate dinner with close friends and family, Tutti Santi is our go-to for authentic Italian.  The service is top notch.     Their gnocchi is, in my opinion, the best in the Valley.  Try it with their pink sauce (you need to request this as the menu lists a cream sauce with a splash of marinara).    My husband loves the Ravioli alla Nina.  It's so good. Sometimes ravioli dishes are so darn heavy, but not here!  Nina's sauces  achieve the fine balance of lightness and flavor and this dish is a prime example.  Finally, try the tiramisu.  Light, fluffy and packed with flavor, this dessert is a great way to end a wonderful meal.

Terminal 4 is the best!  Yummy food is abundant when you have downtime.  Check out the priority club in terminal 2, also.  It's okay to wear jeans and a t-shirt here (it is Phoenix after all).  Try to ignore the often grouchy TSA and check-in staff.

Had a delightful brunch here today!   Service  = Excellent  Food = Tasty!  My husband and I love the New Mexican influences found in each dish on the menu.   Today I got the Carne Adovada Benedict.  It was awesome!  Only complaint (minor) is that my hash browns were slightly undercooked.   I'd requested extra crispy, but it was definitely not the end of the world as I still loved my meal.   My husband had the Chicken Burrito which was also good but I could tell it wasn't his favorite item from Dick's.  Good to know for next time :)  Ambience = We sat in the back room behind the bar area this time.  It seemed like a nice idea at the time but there was another patron there who was literally laying down in the booth on the phone talking business for a few minutes.   It was even more awkward when she randomly got up and insisted that she and her other guest (who had not arrived, yet) were going to sit at the formal dining table for larger parties.  The staff handled the situation professionally and gracefully, though.  Next time I'll prefer to sit where we normally do (in the more lively bar area).  It's tighter in there, but it just feels right for a wonderful spot like Dick's.

If I ever need to go to the ER (and I hope I never do) please take me here.    Every time I'm here to visit a friend or family member I am continually impressed by the amazingly kind and professional staff.  It's clean, organized and filled with the most talented physicians in town.  The cafeteria is even pretty darn good considering it is literally hospital food.  Not a high priority in the list of hospital services to care about but as a guest it's nice not having to drive to some fast food joint down the street.

I will admit the last time I was here a few years ago I was VERY disappointed!  This places was on DDD and i ordered the torta with high hopes.   Turns out, they are just not for me.    However, my SIL asked us to meet them here two nights ago and I am so glad they convinced us to go!    The cameron burro is insanely delicious!  Chipotle crema, prefectly prepared tortillas, so much yum.    I ordered a fancy drink (I think this is a dry restaurant?) and it too me to the beach without the booze! Get the King piña colada, you gotta try it.  My husband ordered the king tacos (with steak) and he loved them.  SIL ordered the same as me, and her husband got another cameron dish that he really enjoyed.    We also got 4 ceviche orders to start and they were really tasty.   They are individual sized and a great way to begin your meal.    If you enjoy Tortas I'm still surr this is the place for you!  They just aren't my cup of tea apparently.  I've now learned that LRdlT can serve up delicious food no matter what you're looking for in a hole in the wall Mexican joint.  One last note:  this place is kid friendly too. Server was attentive and made it fun for him.

So good.  Sooo Sooo good!  The highlights: -wagyu was insanely delicious -oysters were amazing -drink list is extensive and appropriately priced -black cod was outstanding -husband loved the potstickers -salmon sashimi was amazeballs -as always, the butterfish was solid -service rocked!  The not-so-highlights: -ran out of uni -truffle king crab hot pot was just okay (don't get me wrong, I'd still eat it!)  Can't wait to go back!

SHORT VERSION:  MAJOR disappointment tonight.    Just paid $52 for 2 Pasta Heidi's (online menu says $22 each but they are now $24 each) from "Richardson's" when the EXACT SAME ITEM at "Rokerij" is $18.  Received horrendous service from Richardson's tonight.   FULL VERSION:  First off, it really kills me to write this.  My husband and I loved this place and met here often for dinner after work.  It's been a gem for us but I'm not sure we will go back after tonight.  My husband ordered 2 Pasta Heidi's to go tonight for our dinner tonight.  Nothing else.  No sides, no drinks, nada.   It's pretty far out of our way for a to-go order (from our house) but we were craving this delicious dish from Richardson's/Rokerij big time so we were more than willing to make the trek.  However, when my husband was about to sign for the bill, he noticed something felt off.  It was much more expensive than we normally pay.  He asked if the prices went up and the gal mentioned she wasn't sure, but that maybe it was because we had called the Richardson's phone number and not the Rokerij number. He then went to the Rokerij side and checked out their menu.   Mind you, as many people who eat here know, there is a lot of carry over between the two.  In essence you can order many of the same items from one vs the other.  Heck, they even use the same font and menu layout!  Sure enough, he was right.  There was a $6 price difference for the exact same item.  He asked about it and a male server said they had just had this conversation with management last week because it doesn't make any sense and people have mentioned it.   My husband then walked back over to the Richardson's side and asked to speak to someone about it since it must just be a mistake.  Our meal was literally $12 more at Richardson's for no real reason.    After explaining the issue with the lady he was directed to (wish we had gotten her name) all she said "I don't know anything about that" and that "it is what it is" with a very condescending tone.  She neglected to offer any assistance to explore or amend the issue and smugly shrugged at him like he was crazy.  For the record, if this were a mere couple dollar difference we wouldn't have bothered, but $12 is a pretty big difference.  At the end of the day our experience was a seasoned patron's nightmare and it breaks my heart to share this story.  If you absolutely must have the Pasta Heidi, save yourself some frustration and money by ordering it at Rokerij.  Please see my photos for proof.  Both are menu screen caps from their website.   Both documents are dated 6.30.14, which indicates this is an issue they've probably known about for a while and haven't bothered to correct.

Love this place!     I'm always tempted by the weekly special burger.  Sometimes they are so tempting I have to order two burgers:  one special and the brûlée burger.  Try to French toast fries, too.   They are just as tasty as you would imagine them to be.    My husband tried the tacos are they were pretty good too - but only go that route if you really aren't feeling a burger.     Only complaint is that it sometimes feels dirty inside.   Not really in health hazard way, but more in a "please clean your table tops after messy guests don't bother to clean after themselves" kind of way.   I don't like having to throw away other patrons' trash.

My godsister introduced me to this wonderfully talented to woman years ago and I must say she is truly an inspiration.     Let me get the obvious part out of the way:  Saskia and her entire team are among best in the business.  Saskia's career is rooted in high end salon experience.  She, and now her team of glamazons, are the only ones I trust with my blonde hair.  The entire staff at Saskia Salon are always on their A game.  They just get it.  The gals and Corey are always looking their best.  They are always upbeat and full of energy - because they know they are a part of something special.  While I hate to share my secret about this wonderful salon, it would be an injustice not to give this talented team the recognition they deserve.

Food is pretty decent.  I am with all of the other reviewers on the service aspect of this place.  It is SO unorganized here.  The people aren't mean to the customers but it's insane how chaotic it is at such a small establishment.  The old lady is weird and creepy.   There is a strange hostess table in the center of the restaurant that none of the signs tell you to go to.   I see a bunch of staff talking to each other and arguing. They all look so confused its sad.   I wish the restaurant impossible guy would come here and tell these people how to run a restaurant.   Again the food was tasty but the basic functionality customers expect restaurants to have is not there.   I hope they get help because it would be nice to see this place survive.

I had a really wonderful experience with BBG for my kitchen remodel.   They were very attentive and willing to answer any questions I had.    I'd requested bids from a few other places and I felt like I was being pushed into the same cookie cutter design choices for nearly twice the cost.  Jason understood my ideas and helped me find ways to acheive the look I wanted that fit within my budget.  This kind of personalized professionalism is rare these days and I am so happy I found Built By Grace.     When they were in my home they were respectful, clean and trustworthy.  They arrived on time and the project was completed on schedule.  Don't know how else to say it, but I was more than impressed through and through.  Needless to say, when I am ready to tackle my master bathroom I will definitely be calling them again.

Great food and great service!    Came here last weekend on a Sunday night and didn't realize they were closing for the evening.  The owner opened the door and said to please come in with such sincerity.   We ended up deciding to stay and are so glad we did!   Got their egg rolls, Thai tea, massaman curry and fried rice.  It was all delicious!   Going back tonight :)

Great little spot on Central!    My husband and I have been meaning to try it for a while now and we finally made it in last night.  It was 8pm on a Saturday so needless to say they were busy.  But we were seated right away at the bar so we didn't have a wait.  Our bartender/server was awesome and I'm glad we made the choice to be seated at the bar.  I had the "hey bartender" and my drink ended up being a tasty concoction of gin, basil, and lemony goodness.  My husband had the grapefruit soda and that was really refreshing with the right balance of tart and sweet.  We loved our shrimp and chive dumplings so much that we ordered another round of dumplings and tried the pig face dumplings.  Also good!  We split the pork ramen and it was pretty good, as well.  A little salty but I'd prefer the broth be a little savory instead of bland.  Overall the service, food and energy were great.  Can't wait to go back for more.

It's never fun having to write reviews like this one but I felt I needed to share a few things.  Hopefully management makes a few changes because I really want this place to do well!  Before I list my feedback I do want to call out that this place just opened, and it's their first location in Phoenix so they may just need to work out some of these kinks.  - Ordering/pick up process is terrible.  just terrible.   The layout of the restaurant is confusing, unorganized and downright uncomfortable.  It's hard to explain but once you order your food you have to wait in this tight, long hallway next to the kitchen where servers run into you to grab food and bring it to some of the tables. At one point the line was so long to wait for food some of the people I was next to had to step outside because it was hot and making them claustrophobic.   Honestly I didn't blame them.  I snapped a quick photo after they had just stepped away which doesn't quite show how tight it was but it will give you an idea of the space I'm talking about.  - Quality of my food was less than epic.  I ordered a pick 2 (soup and half sammy).   The most disappointing part was my "French onion" soup.  Normally FO soup comes topped with cheesey goodness and some crunchy bread.   I literally got watery brown broth with onion strips.  Nothing else.       Either they forgot how to make it or ran out of ingredients?  I was in a huge hurry after having to wait so long for my food that I didn't have time to hunt someone down to correct it.     - Napa chicken salad sandwich was dry :(   Not even sure how a chicken salad sandwich could be dry but this one was.  Bummer.  - Chocolate chip cookie was good!  I have lots of faith in their bakery section.   Will definitely try more next time.  - Server who took my order was very pleasant!  Oh, Panera.  I want to love you so badly.  I'll be back sometime to give you another shot, and I hope to update this review for the better :)

This is a really cool spot.  My friend Nicki happened to notice this on our way to grab lunch in the area one day and suggested we pop in.  I'm sure glad we did!  It's been hard to find anything relatively healthy in this area.  It's either burgers, pizza, chinese or sandwiches crammed with fatty ingredients.   Thank goodness for Mod!   You have to try the heirloom tomato salad!  Fresh mozzarella, crunchy little wheat croutons and of course fresh heirloom tomatoes!   They come lightly drizzled in sweet balsamic  vinegar and olive oil.  Fresh, filling, delightful!  My friend gets the grilled cheese and always seems to be happy with it.    The other cool thing about this space is that it's a co-working facility.   If you freelance or need a great meeting space you should consider a membership at this place.    Note:  membership not required to eat at the cafe.

Oh my,  first off let me start by saying how much it saddens me to write this review!  I really wanted to love this place.  Maybe it was an off night when we went last weekend, but man were lots of things "off".  All of the tables outside on the south side (behind the bar) are sitting on slanted slab.  So when anyone orders any food (especially with sauces) it all leans up to the very edge of the plate it's on.  Staff in a hurry will pick these plates up haphazardly and then the sauce spills onto the table, chairs and then eventually you.  Honest mistake and not a big deal in our case, but how many times does this happen??    Now the food.  I'm sorry to say but our sushi was NOT good.  Some of the rolls had potential but they were ruined (for my taste) with cucumber wraps or weak ingredient combos.   The uni was not fresh.  Luckily the market price was only $4, so I was relieved I wasn't charged and arm and a leg for it.  Also, we had to ask for wasabi and ginger twice. Our sushi plates did not have any.  Now for the highlights:  The garlic edamame, pot stickers and miso cod were great!  Perfectly prepared - especially the cod!   The service was great, too!  Lots of nice people walking around making sure we were doing ok.  Really appreciated their positive spirit here.  Makes for a pleasant evening for sure.    Again, I'm really hoping it was an off night, but it was really hard spending over $100 for two people (no drinks) on low grade food and nerve wracking outdoor seating.

Awesome food and service!  Just ate breakfast here with my husband and we loved it.  We were surprised that it wasn't overly busy for a Saturday morning.  What we ordered:  -orange juice (fresh squeezed) -croque madame -French toast -sausage    All were top notch and delicious!  The bread and vanilla citrus custard quality really shine in the French toast.  The croque Madame balanced the tasty flavors of the gruyere cheese, egg and ham.  Yum yum yum!  The service was great too.  This isn't a formal sit down and a server takes your order set up, but believe me they absolutely care that you have a great experience.  The owner came by and gently asked how our food was and what else we might need.  She was truly concerned that we enjoyed our meal and experience.    Finally - for those who visit, read the note by the tip jar.  It's cute and represents what this place is all about :)
