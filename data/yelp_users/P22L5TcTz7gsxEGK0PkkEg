I had a great experience with Shane Co!!! They had exactly what I was looking for. Their staff is great, very friendly and knowledgeable.

I don't think it is fair that I pay $20 for a car wash and the outside of my car is still dirty. It's like they just ran the car thru the machine and let it air dry. I am never going back to this place again. What a waste of time and money.

This place is great. There are a ton of different Asian inspired options. Really decent portion size and constantly delicious.

Do you know what is awesome? When you make a reservation, arrive on time an have to wait over 20 mins for your table. That is completely unacceptable and unprofessional. And if they tell me it will be just a few more minutes because "the table is being cleaned" I am going to call them out on their bullshit lie!!!

Was in the mood for Italian and figured we would give this place a try. Wow, what a great decision. The food is amazing, I ordered the Chicken Gorgonzola and it did not disappoint.

Recently had Cummings pest control out to the house. I started noticing unwanted visitors mainly large cockroaches that decided to take residence in my home. I was less than please with their visit. I called Cummings and they had a tech out right away.  Josh was absolutely great. He was extremely polite and very informative. I was concerned that the product would have negative effects on my dog. Josh educated me that the products used were safe and very effective.   I would highly recommend using this company for any pest control.

Menu is ok, service is subpar. Waitress Amanda was not pleasant and seemed annoyed to serve my party of four. I have gone to this place a few times before but after tonight's experience I will now take my business elsewhere.

Very impressed. The food was great especially the pretzel fondue. The place is a bit loud when full

This is the best steak I have ever had. Simply perfection. The food and service is totally worth the cost. My reservation was last night and I received a call the day after thanking me for my patronage and checking to see if I enjoyed my meal. That's impressive.

This place is very disappointing, had to wait over an hour for a mediocre breakfast sandwich that was cold

These guys are just simply great. Totally worthy of 5 starts. I identified a water leak in one of my supply lines in my kitchen ceiling this past Sunday. I gave them a call right away and they were able to accommodate my schedule and were out to my house Monday afternoon to make the repair. After an hour or so the problem area was repaired better than expect and I no longer have a water leak in kitchen ceiling. Thank you for the great work and exceeding my expectations.
