Very short review, Village Inn let down today. It was Wednesday, which means it was free pie day. Usually when you're done with the meal, or when they bring out your food, they'd either ask you, "are you getting a free slice of pie today?" This is probably the first time it has happened. A free pie wasn't even mentioned. I didn't just order a drink to get a free slice of pie, I ordered a full breakfast item with a coffee.

So my friends and I always come here. For some reason today, was the worse experience I've had here. The server and was extremely rude. We ordered bulgogi,  and I thought under the assumption,  if we say I'm ordering for two, and we purposely sat at a table with a BBQ stove. The assumption would be that we would be doing BBQ. So they just brought us cooked bulgogi.

I'm a veteran and I still had my uniform on because I just got off work and decided to get groceries on the way home from work with a friend. Bad experience, I most likely I will not shop at this fry's ever again. I was shopping with my friend picking up ingredients for dinner and one of the ingredients happens to be red wine. My friend is not 21, I even tried to explain that the wine is for cooking. I don't know anyone who buys a $5 bottle of wine for drinking. So I payed for the groceries I was able to get. I came back at a later time after i dropped of the groceries at my house which was a short 1 min drive. I returned without my friend and I was still unable to buy the wine for cooking. So I was kicked out for trying to buy an ingredient for cooking and about 8 customers with full shopping carts in line walked out after I did because they were very offended by the way they treated me.

Well first off this happened a few months ago. I decided to get some mexican for lunch and Garcia's was in the mall where I work. We placed our order and the food came out a little late. So we asked to get it to go, the waiter literally said "are you f**king kidding me?" I was very surprised and told him "yes I'm f**cking serious". How are you going to use that language towards a customer. I was late getting back to work because they took their sweet time packing it up. It wasn't just the one server, the entire staff are a bunch of dicks. I'm never going there again.

It was Valentine's Day,. my girl friend and I were having a double date with our friends. We usually get the tepen, but all the the seats reserved. So we decided to do dine in. I ordered the unagi dish. For some reason it took them awhile for me to get it. When I finally got the dish, it was ice cold. I can think of two scenarios on why it was ice cold. 1. It  was made and forgotten about a left on the counter. 2. Somebody else ordered it and didn't want it, so did they decided to give it to me instead of making me a fresh one. Either way I had to eat cold food. I probably could have told them it was cold and they probably could have fixed it. But my judgement is on how they got it done the first time, not how they can make up for it. A good excuse on why it was cold would have been that it's supposed to be served cold, but I've ordered this dish in the past it was always served hot or at least warm.

I came here with a group of 8, I had a good time and the food was great.  BUT, they forgot my yakitori order.  So this review went from a 5 star to a 1 star.  I know I'm being harsh, but, at this point I stopped caring. I still gave the server a 15% tip since he didn't include it in the bill bc he forgot about it. But I did mention it like three times.

We decided to go to Luna's Pizza on Halloween with my girlfriend. We decided to get the 22.99 deal, a Large Pizza with 20 wings. We made our order and decided to get 3 toppings.  When we paid we the total was over $30. The special displayed on the window did not specify anything about it only being one topping. The person taking our order did not have the courtesy or telling us the deal only applies a one topping pizza. I haven't even tasted their food, but customers service is what matters most. I'm just saying,  if we're expecting to get the special for $22.99, they should tell us while we're adding toppings that the special only applies to one topping.

I'm not saying the food is bad, I just never received it. Who ever is manning online orders didn't see the order for two hours. So I'm not giving them this low score for the food, I'm giving them the low score because they didn't pay attention. I was starving waiting for two hours for an order that was never started. I think that is total bull crap. They asked me if I wanted to the order still and it would take 60 minutes for the order, They were basically telling me that I have to wait three hours for my food.  They also said they'd make it up to me if I ordered again. How do I know someone will see it this time. I'm probably not going to order from their again. I wound up getting Jimmy Johns, that took 10 minutes from when i submitted my order.

I am writing this review as I wait here for the server to take our order. We've arrived at 7:45 pm. The waitress has arrived at 7:56 pm. She has taken our drink order at 7:56pm.  We ordered Two beers,  a Pepsi and waters .  They've arrived at 8:00 pm. She has taken our order at 8:02. It is 8:07 pm, she brought out the cornbread and biscuits. So far so good.  8:20pm. Food has arrived. They are getting a 4 for good service. They lost 1 star for a late start.

Alright guys, so I was in the mood to get some Thai ice tea. when I ordered, I specifically said I wanted a smoothie. She gave me a regular one with ice. Don't even ask about the whipped cream, she didn't even fill the lid up, it was like a little bitty spritz of whip cream. Never going to the Bosa on Southern in Tempe again. Also you have to have a minimum of $5 to purchase with a card, or you can pay a 50 cent charge to use your card. The one on country club doesn't require a minimum purchase of $5. You may asked why didn't I asked them to fix it? You only get one chance to get it right.

I decided to have lunch before a movie. around May of 2012. I was going to give this place a low score because the Ikura and quail egg sushi I ordered looked terrible. I wasn't even going to eat it until the server saw that I did not even touch it. He brought out a fresh dish and that changed my mind. The oysters were great, good size and good seasoning.

So I was at the airport and was in the mood for some coffee before the flight. So I decided to stop by Peet's coffee shop. I asked for a white chocolate mocha. I wanted it with almond milk because I'm lactose intolerant. The first coffee they gave me was a chocolate mocha. I can tell they used regular skim milk, it was in a gallon milk jug with a blue lid. I told them I got a white chocolate mocha, they then proceeded to make me a white chocolate mocha. They used skim milk again, I can easily tell the difference between whole milk,  2%, skim mill, soy and almond milk.  as soon as I took a sip I can tell it was skim milk.  I didn't bother going back, so that is why I'm writing this review.

I don't know what exact happened to the service here, but I've been going to Tea Snow for 3 years and my recent visit really upset me. My girlfriend ordered a special, the coconut cream with grass jelly.  And they brought coconut water with grass jelly, when she confronted the girls working, the girls were very condescending and rude, telling my girl friend they need to order it a specific way, even though she specifically asked for the special  and pointed at the picture,  which looks like coconut cream and not coconut water.  They correct the drink,  but we have a suspicion that they may have just added the cocon cream to the drink, instead of making a new drink.  We can tell the girls were new because the staff is usually polite. They whispered to each other and laughed after they gave my girlfriend the drink. We have a feeling they did something to the drink. Soon after my girlfriend got sick, she started getting a sore throat and vomited.  This has never happened to us in the three years we've been coming to tea snow. I am very disappointed question if I should ever come back.

I usually don't do reviews unless places piss me off, but Ike's is an exception. They have the best sandwiches I have ever had. I live within walking distance of Ike's, which is a huge plus for me. I plan on going there regularly. I also really enjoy the music, from what I've heard, everything is from the 90's.

So we were at a convention this past weekend and we wanted to get lunch. We've heard a lot about Pizza Studio and we decided to give it a shot. We took our orders, it was farley simple. We gave them our names when we went to made the orders. We were sitting at our table, we noticed my friend's pizza coming out, the runner yelled out Kristina,  his recipe said Kristian. The runner then gives my pizza to some random guy who said it was his. The random guy wrapped it up in the paper and ran out the door. Not to be racist or anything, but the runner was Mexican and so was the guy who took my friends pizza, the food runner had a pretty thick accent, I'm thinking he may have been in one it, just saying. Anyways, my food came out and it was pretty good. When my friend went up to confront them, they said we're going to make you another one, it's like they knew they gave it away and instead of informing him, it looks like they were going to make him one and not tell him they "accidentally " gave it away to the wrong guy, they weren't even apologetic. The food was great, but it seemed like they didn't really care that they gave my friends pizza away and it seemed like they wanted to cover it up by making him one and hoping he didn't notice.

This place just opened up by my place and I decides to give it a try. So the inside decor was very clean and clearly had a theme. As I opened up the menu, I was a little surprised on the prices, a little high, but further reading it, the portions were quite large. I went with a more of a cost effective choice, I got the half dozen oyster,  and three seafood Tacos. I'm thinking  I should have gotten two tacos, they were much bigger than I thought. Service was ok.
