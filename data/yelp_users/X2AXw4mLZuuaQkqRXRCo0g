Such great service!  Everyone in there is so nice.  My husband bought my engagement ring at Ganem and they are always so helpful whenever I bring it in to get cleaned or buffed.  Great staff & never any pressure to purchase.  The only jewelers we will use from now on.

I love this place.  The sandwiches are unique and fresh and always made right in front of you.  The service has always been good and the prices are reasonable (same as any other sandwich shop).  I have tried many of their sandwiches and enjoyed them, my favorite is the cheesesteak, but beware- the peppers are spicy!

Horrible customer service.  I drove out to this place multiple times after being told on the phone that the "owner" would be in and the owner was never in!  I was told that he is the only person who can give a cost quote so the first time I went by they turned me away and advised me to come back tomorrow at 9 am.  Went in at 9 and was told that the owner won't be in til noon that day.  Next day I called and was told to come in at 10, went in at 10 and was told no one knew when he would be in.  This place dosen't care about its customers, there are plenty of good upholstery places in the valley, don't waste your time or money.

Not great service, not great rooms.  Crowded, loud...wouldn't recommend.

Matthew L on the patio is the worst server ever!  We went on Saturday and got really bad food (cold, stale) and received horrible service (had to track down waiter to order, no refills, never came back to check on status of meal).  I typically like the YH, for HH at least, but felt compelled to warn people about the horrible experience we had sitting out on the patio last Saturday.  I contact YH- hopefully they will take some action to rectify the situation.

I was a little nervous to try this place based on some of  the reviews, but I had also heard that this BounceU is under new management so I thought it would be worth giving it a try, especially since the price is so reasonable.  I don't have any complaints, the staff were friendly and attentive and the place was clean.  Also, as stated above, you can't beat the price!  I think the new management has helped a lot...either that or I just went on a good day.  In my opinion, it's definitely worth a visit if you need a place for a party or to entertain the kids for the day.

Fresh food, clean place, good prices, highly recommend.  I always get the gyro and love that the meat isn't greasy!

I love Firehouse Subs!  The briskit and cheddar is the best.  I only wish they served fries and not just chips.

We had a fantastic experience.  We went mid week and almost had the place to ourselves.  The man I had for massage was FANTASTIC, he really made me feel relaxed and comfortable.  It was our anniversary so they also brought us champagne to drink while we were waiting.  The steam room and sauna are some of the best I have experienced and there is a non-stop supply of drinks and snacks that are complimentary inside the spa.  Definitely plan to stay for atleast a few hours to take full advantage of the place.

Food is always fresh & delicious, we stop in at least once a week for their gyro plate. Love the dressing on the green salad, highly recommend.

I went here for the first time last weekend for lunch and was pleasantly surprised at the selection of sandwiches and drinks available.  We also got a meat & cheese tray to sample some of the varieties they carry in store.  I was also so happy to see that they carry many local wines, such as my favorite, Stronghold!  But be advised, this is definitely a spot for the adventurous eater.  There are a lot of unique ingredients so if you are looking for just a normal sandwich, this is not the place to get it.

Burgers are good but the service is SO SLOW and the lines are always so long.  Food is inconsistent also.  Every visit they are out of something from their menu.  Last visit they were out of avocado.  :(  And that's one of the main reasons I choose there to get a burger.  To me, at a minimum, a restaurant should have all of their menu items in stock at all times.  I won't go back, there are plenty of other burger places that also provide good customer service.

Great local bar/ restaurant. They recently expanded the menu to include craft food & beer...good food for a sports bar! Staff & owner are always really friendly & provide good service.

I'm always a little nervous about trying a new massage therapist, but I found Kenta on Yelp and I'm so glad I gave him a shot!  I've been getting massages for 10+ years and always find it difficult to find someone who is knowledgeable about different therapeutic massage techniques and consistent in their delivery, but Kenta is fantastic.  His deep tissue massages are extremely effective for my neck and back pain without being painful (as they have been with other therapists).    I love that you can book online and his prices are very reasonable.  Highly recommend!!!

I first went here because I bought the Groupon for the IPL photofacial, but I have continued to go for all my MedSpa needs because their service & pricing are fantastic!  I love Naetresse- she is the best esthetician I have seen and I have been to a LOT of Med Spas.  I drive 45 minutes from Ahwatukee to receive services here...it's worth it!

Love the carne asada tacos.  The place is clean, staff is friendly and they have one of those nifty coke machines where you have 1000's of mixing choices.  We've been there several times already and plan to return.
