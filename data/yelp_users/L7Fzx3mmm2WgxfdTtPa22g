Wish I was able to give no stars. A group of 5 of us went to get sushi here on Friday. I called ahead of time to ask about happy hour and what time it was over. The women on the phone told me it was all night. This is why we decided to go here over Kona Grill, which was a huge mistake. We got there and ordered. The server we had was new which was no problem, I'm in the service industry and understand that being new is hard, but the service was very slow and I could tell she was frazzled. When it came to the check it showed that none of the stuff we ordered was at the happy hour price. I asked the manager about it and she told me I got incorrect information about the happy hour times and there was nothing she could do about it. The sushi was mediocre and for the price we had to pay, it was not worth it. I will never be back nor will I recommend this place to any of my clients in the area.

My boyfriend and I visited Macayo's for dinner and we both where impressed by our waiter. (I wish I remembered his name) He was on top of everything despite it being a very busy friday night rush. He brought us waters right away and was very attentive throughout our meal. The food was delicious, I had the chimichanga and my boyfriend had a shrimp burrito. The shrimp burrito is not on the menu but our waiter said he would make it happen. We where very satisfied with our experience and will for sure be back!

I LOVE AZ88! This place is amazing and what makes it even more amazing is my favorite server REBECCA! She always ends up being our server every time we go in and I'm always so happy! She is awesome! Super nice and funny, also she is on top of everything and thinks of things the table needs before even asking! My boyfriend and I had our first date there and just went again yesterday for our two year anniversary and Rebecca brought us a piece of cheese cake with two candles on it!! So sweet! I always recommend AZ88 to all  my clients (Im a Hairstylist in scottsdale) looking for an awesome place to eat and get a killer martini with blue cheese stuffed olives!!  I always make sure to tell them to sit in Rebecca's section because she's awesome!!!

Horrible service! My car came out just as dirty as it was when I dropped it off! Inside console was not wiped off and still dusty! Also my paint was peeled off on the outside due to the pressure wash! They didn't even wipe off the writing on my window that they wrote with white crayon!  I will NEVER go back!

My boyfriend and I are new to the area and just driving around and found Hula's -we are so happy we did! We had couple beers at the bar before being sat. Try the koko brown seasonal on tap, soooo delicious! One of the best beers I've had. Food was amazing! I got the short ribs and he got the jerk pork plate. We where both super happy and definitely going to be coming back!

I was in desperate  need of an eyebrow wax and my usual girl at madison avenue was not available. I decided to take a risk and come to European wax center. bad choice. The girls at the front desk where nice but it was clear that they are trained to sell hard on their packages. They ask me multiple times if i wanted to buy a package. The worst part was that when I went into the waxing room I told the lady that i didn't want them very thin and to just clean up the line of my brow. She showed me them after putting some powder on to fill them in a bit. They looked fine until I washed the makeup off my face and realized that my eyebrows are SUPER thin and almost non existent at the end except for like one hair!  :[ sad day! wish I would have been patient and waited for my regular girl at madison ave. I wont make that mistake again!

YES! I finally found the one! :) my eyebrows where horrendous and I was scared to get them done anywhere because I had a horrible experience at European wax center previously. I decided to try out Anastasia because a few of the girls I work with at my salon in scottsdale recommended it. I ended up just waking in and getting booked with Samuel. He is amazing!  My brows look better then they ever have before! I found my guy for sure! Go check him out!! :)
