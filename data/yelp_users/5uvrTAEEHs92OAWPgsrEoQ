Dr. Steven Hall and his beautiful staff took such excellent care of my sweet kitty. They were very gentle, loving and compassionate with her frail little sick body. And they were ever so helpful with instructions and telling me what to do to restore her health from her dehydration and infection. Thank you so much for helping me take care of my sick kitty. You will be be my permanent veterinarian from now on.

DO NOT WASH YOUR CAR HERE. Got the supreme wash. Poor vaccume job. Circular and cross hatch Scratches on my entire hood of my car. Didn't wash inside of windows. Grease left on sides of my car. Auto wash manager was a real jerk didn't want to correct or take responsibility for the damage.  On a positive note: the conveinance store was clean and pleasant. Staff was friendly.  Mario: was very kind and took it upon himself and buffed the scratches out of my hood and fixed areas that weren't clean. Thank you. He should be the auto wash manager, he possesses actual customer service skills.   Cassey: convenience store manager was polite and pleasant and apologized. He also would have been a better manager then that jerk auto wash manager.  Oh and whatever your name is Mr. AUTO wash manager...I can read lips. I know what you said when you were looking at my hood and disrespecting me as a woman and a customer.  You should be ashamed of yourself and your corporate office will be notified.

Anna is terrific! She cut my hair perfectly. Even in this humidity or high heat my hair is styling effortlessly. It's amazing the difference a GOOD haircut makes!!

I just enjoyed the most flavorful and scrumptious lunch. Considering the quality of food and service I am very surprised this place isn't packed! The staff was very pleasant and quick to serve, restaurant was impeccably clean, the elephant pillows are adorable. You can see the kitchen staff in the back prepping food and cleanliness and sanitation is superb which makes me confident I won't be experiencing an upset tummy later.   The thai iced tea is the best that I have had in over 4 years. The plates are beautiful and the food tasted so fresh. Perfect blend of spices and flavors! I highly recommend dining here. Food is underpriced considering the quality, you are getting more then what you pay for.

Jessica has been doing my lashes for awhile now and I highly recommend her. My lashes last a long time,  never damage or pull out my natural lashes, are never glued to each other. They feel natural and look glamorous. The spa is always clean. Music is a delight to listen to. Beautiful.
