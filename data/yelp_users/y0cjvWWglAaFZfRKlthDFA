I've been going to Eye Priority since 2008. I love this office, very personal, professional and fun. I have been seen by both of their doctors and feel comfortable with each of them. I highly recommend Eye Priority.

CLOSED..... Tried this place on a whim. Drive-thru is what caught my eye! Not very busy... but this is a gem in hiding! I tried the 4 mini tacos for under $4.50 and they were soooo yummy!!! They are a new business but I'm sure once it catches on it's gonna be busy all the time!

Amazing food. Chicken salad sandwich was very good. They have a cheese pizza/flatbed that was amazing, the pepperoni one was a little more spicy,  but not too much.  Very good!! Mandatory valet. Enter in the front & exit out back.

Oh Mango's --- how I love you and staff, especially David. Even when missed a few years in a row of visiting, David remembered us, our son, and always asks about the missing one in our family if we come with out someone. Staff is awesome- always ready to help. Yes you order then they bring you drinks, chips and salsa, but they are so on top of things, sometimes they are waiting on you to pick a table and follow you to your table. Outside seating is nice, although not during "rush hour' - ok it doesn't get that busy on Main, but I don't like smelling traffic when it's heavier than normal. But a few spring evenings we have not wanted to leave the nice breeze and occasion music that someone has stopped to make a few tips. FOOD -- I'm one that if I find something I like at a restaurant that I get the same thing everytime. BUT not at Mango's - every dish I've tried I have loved. I get all kinds of things. Their chicken tacos have a bit to them, but I'm  a slight wimp. The shrimp burrito is amazing - again warmer than normal. SHredded beef is awesome. They use white cheese in their quesidillas. Their chips are AMAZING and i love their salsa. They have the frescas, but when we go at night they don't have them. Sat mornings is the best chance at the watermelon- which is TO die for! LOVE everything I have had! See you soon David!

I had seen an ad for this place in the East Valley Tribune's Best of East Valley publication last March. Since I live near downtown Mesa, it was on my ....list of "we'll eat there one of these days!"  Last night was THE NIGHT. We parked in back, being familiar with the old Tribune building I knew there would be parking back there. So, we entered from the back. Came down a long hallway but could smell the pastry.  We saw the kitchen, very open, workers working hard and the cashier had quite a long line of mostly teenagers and few of us middle aged people in line. A little bit of everything.  We made it through the line, someone in front of us ask us if this was our first time and we said Yes. She said to order the Ace of Spades, as it was a meatball sandwich. I thought I wanted pizza and hubby wanted the meatball sandwich, so I went for the chicken Parmesan.  We did wait quite awhile, seemed like too long as we were pretty hungry, but as busy as the place was, we really didn't mind people watching as it was down town Mesa'a 2nd Friday and they were having a character contest. Kinda fun and creepy to have zombies (alive ones) peering in the windows, but it did entertain us for awhile.  Once our food came, I was surprised how big the sandwiches were and the bread, looked like homemade bread. It was so warm to touch but then I dared and the food was just perfect temperature to eat. I was worried that it would be sloppy because the chicken parm was cut up in small pieces, but that just made it easier to eat. It stayed together VERY well and just a few small pieces dropped, but they didn't sit there for long. Hubby was really enjoying his very full of meatballs sandwich.  It's the bread...that was to die for....it's got me craving it already again this morning. It will be on our new - eat list - especially being open on Sunday!!!!  I am looking forward to eating there again and trying the pizza, but I can't imagine it being better than that chicken parm!!!!! Decor was fun, seating was full, but it was fun to see one huge table for about 16 people to sit at -- it was always full of teens, but that's ok! It's right next door to a GREAT antique and scrapbooking store...bonus for me.   DOn't wait-- go there NOW!

We love Logan's. We eat there 2-3 times a month. Their Mon-Wed special, 2 meals for $14.99 is a GREAT deal. If you just drink water with your meal you can eat there for under $20 for two people and eat steak and salmon. YUM! Love their service and their rolls are awesome.

This was the worst service we have ever had at O.G. I had never been to this location before but was with a friend that does go to this location often. The server did not write down the order. He got the soup wrong, then the entrees wrong as well. Slow lunch service even though we ordered off the lunch menu that is supposed to be quicker.

Tried this place on a whim because the place next door was closed for summer vacation.  We got cheeseburgers and onion rings and shakes. Very good burgers -cooked perfect, onion rings we're the BEST!!!!  They have Thrifty Ice cream of which I'm not a huge fan of, but shakes were ok. Small place, but they do have a patio which, during the right time if the year would be nice. Would definitely go again to try other things on menu & have more beer battered onion rings!!!!

I HAD been going to this place for 2 years, then it changed ownership and I am NOT a happy camper.  Prior it was wonderful and a trustworthy place.  The ONE time they did my oil change they failed put an air filter back in...WHAT? How's that happen. NOT cool. They also said I needed the same repair that my records showed from the last time- however, I had it done by someone else, so they DIDN'T even look! Of course, they found other things wrong too.  I went to the Performance Auto out at Superstition Springs and it was the "old" owners. They said that they are getting A LOT of people back from the other store. Lots of complaints.  EEK!  So, I will go all the way out to Superstitions Springs - also - Go to their website and print out coupons for $14.99 oil change.

Decided to try this place out on a night we couldn't figure out what to eat. Great idea!! Kinda slow for a Friday night, but we were greeted by the chef himself asking us if we'd been there before and explaining their menu, etc. They change their menu with the seasons so we tried a few things that will be going away so we can try more things later. All fresh, locally grown if I remember right. Very good food. I had the Shrimp pesto fettuccine and hubby had a burger. We were both very pleased. impressed. Crepes are one of their specialty items... yummo!!! Had to try them!! The Chef & another guy own the restaurant together. Their place is created out of the idea... what kind of place would we want to go to.  Will be going back.
