Has gone down hill since I've been going... The last straw was the change of the nachos... They now suck and they used to be my favorite in the valley!! Smaller, less toppings, worse tasting! Hopefully the change back!

This place must have really turned around!  I see Dr. Wright and he is absolutely amazing!! I read the reviews that they may charge $$$$ for services, but you have to AGREE to do them and sign an estimate before they proceed! Medicine is expensive, get over it! Everything can't be diagnosed on physical exam alone.  What Ii have noticed is that it's cheaper to do the Wellness plan here than any other vet I have called!  Oh, and my dog loves Dr. Wright!!!

This place is awesome!  FRESH produce at CHEAP prices.  The produce may not look the best, but it sure tastes like the best!

I would give zero. This is by far the worst Mexican place ever. They increased prices and the service is so deplorable... I hope this place goes under soon!

Well, this place is now under new ownership.  I can't comment on the past owners, but the new owner, Dr. Wright, is amazing.  He interacts with my baby girl (Bella) in a way that makes her feel comfortable, even while giving her vaccines.  He is VERY thorough both in the work up and the explanation afterwards of what to expect/watch out for, etc.  The office staff is very friendly, and greeted me as soon as I walked in the door.  I have followed Dr. Wright around the valley for a reason, he is very competent and able to undertake some pretty advanced medical cases.  You can't go wrong with this guy!

The only reason I go here is because it's cheap... You can't hear or tune to hear the audio on the TV's because you need to have an FM transmitter... REALLY... who carries around FM Transmitters??  Equipment looks outdated as well.  No towel service.

How could you ever go bad with Oregano's?  The only complaint I have is that ALL the food has some sort of spice in it...!

The food here is so freaking good.  Totally a hipster place, but once you eat a Pasty, you will come back no matter what!  Just recently expanded too!

Used to be good... Now they don't acknowledge you and help people that come in after you... Definitely don't want to come back or keep their service with this customer "service".

Haven't ever had a good experience here... This location is terrible! The service is pretty terrible... always! The location is "on a wait" even though there are available tables.  We were told we could be seated right away, then had to wait... And wait... And we were the only ones waiting! The food is good, but I would personally never deal with this place again! Truly miserable!  The only reason I gave it two stars was because they realized they screwed up and gave us free drinks and appetizers... And we finally just sat at the bar (after 30-45 minutes)... The bartender was really really good!

I love this place.  They are very friendly, don't try to up-sell, do a great job, and have very reasonable prices!!!!  They also just got all new chairs for pedicures!!  I really like this place a lot!

Not a fan of this place.  They are overpriced and repairs take forever.  Will be searching for a new Dealership.

Not a big fan... was out of most alcoholic beverages attempted to be ordered.  Food was decent, but service was mediocre.

My boyfriend surprised me with a birthday dinner here.  This restaurant made my night so special and memorable.  Not only was the food amazing (SERIOUSLY AMAZING), the staff was beyond attentive, helpful, and funny!  I can't speak highly enough about this place... although I might be a little biased since I had such an amazing night here with my boyfriend.

Have been wanting to try this place and finally did... By far one of the best places I've eaten at in a while. Pierogi's, chicken schnitzel, crab cakes, tilapia.... All very amazing! The owner is so friendly and inviting... The only problem I had is that I ate too much to fit dessert!

I LOVE subway... Just like the others except it smells new, looks beautiful, and the employees are still learning and a bit slow :-)

Eh... Not enough bartenders for the grand opening. Little different layout than the previous Amsterdam... Maybe with time it will get better.. So many lights it's really bright in here as well... Drinks were good!

Awesome ambiance!  They did a good job with the small space they had.  The servers here are so friendly and they have an awesome drink list... not to mention AWESOME Wednesday all afternoon happy hour!  This place is a must try!

First of all, they aren't doing happy hour appetizers... Stupid... Why ADVERTISE a happy hour?  Secondly, the wings are so dry! They aren't that big either...  Thirdly, the Garlic Parmesan fries are cold, hard, and soggy, even the replacement order we got... The food just isn't good at all :-/  Fourth, it's sooooo sooooo loud you can't have a conversation  Their saving grace? The people are very friendly...  Good luck staying alive...!

Holy god!! Everything is so so good!! Let's just start off with service... So immediate, so friendly, so helpful!! Food came out almost instantaneously!!  We ordered salsa (very spicy), guacamole (worth every penny), and their corn queso to start (out of this world)!!  The pineapple pork taco was sweet and delicious! The green chili chicken bowl was literally cooked to perfection! Needless to say we were stuffed after all this! The "fresh one margarita" was very fresh. Oh, and if you come Monday for happy hour (3-6) you get 1/2 price apps, and discounted drinks... And all day Monday is Taco Monday... So $2 and $3 tacos!!  This is seriously AMAZING and needs to be checked out by all!
