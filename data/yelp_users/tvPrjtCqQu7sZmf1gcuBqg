We love this restaurant, and come here for every Valentine's day and our anniversary. The steaks are amazing, melt-in-your-mouth and delicious! But most of all we come here for the service; I don't think we've ever had mediocre or bad service at this location.   I just learned that they're closing this one because the stupid building owners won't renew their lease, lame! We are so so sad, but hope to see some of our favorite servers at the other location (shout out to Ken and Shay!) :)

I was in a wedding and needed to get my nails done, so the bride and everybody chose this place, probably because they were cheaper. But, depending on the service I got, I'd much rather pay a few extra dollars.   The area was kind of ghetto, and the spa itself wasn't very clean or welcoming. They were so understaffed/mismanaged that when I went in, I was greeted by a man who was already working on someone else's nails; he couldn't be bothered to get up and check the schedule or anything.   The lady who ended up doing my pedicure was nice, but then the one who ended up doing my nails wasn't very friendly, even though I tried to make small talk with her. Their magazine choices were also limited to OK and People, so if you don't care for celebrity gossip you're screwed. Overall the service and location were subpar, and the prices weren't all that great, so I will probably not be going back.

Me and my husband have lived here for about 4 years, and before that he had lived here about a year and half before we got married. 2 years ago, our lease was up on our one bedroom, and we transferred over to a two bedroom because we loved living here so much, but needed more space, and we just didn't want to go anywhere else.  We really love this place. Great location, easy access to the freeway and popular stores (yay Target!), yet it's enough out of the way so you feel some privacy and quiet. The floor plans are very spacious and have an intuitive layout, it's nice and feels more like a condo or house than an apartment. There's about 150 units or so, which is the perfect amount. Small enough where you don't feel lost, yet enough so it's not creepy.  The buildings and grounds are beautiful and kept clean (maybe a little TOO clean--every Monday morning at 7 or 8 the grounds maintenance comes with their leaf blowers, it's loud and a little annoying they do it so early. That's my one complaint after living here 4 years!)  We also really like the manager and staff who work here; they are very nice and professional, and keep a close eye on things. They know us by name and chit chat about things going on in our lives; here you're a person, not just a unit number.   I feel very safe and happy here and I think we'll stay for a while, at least until we buy or rent a house someday :)

I've heard a lot of good things about Razz's, and found a good Groupon, so we decided to try it. Glad we did! This place is quaint, eccentric, and GOOD FOOD.   My husband got the lamb chops and I got the duck breast. Everything was tasty, cooked to perfection, and amazing. The sauces are to die-for!  The experience was fun too. I noticed the chef (Razz) talked and joked with his patrons, and even personally went around to every table to make sure everything was good. This place is a little pricey, but the food and service are worth it.

What can I say, I am IN LOVE with this place! Everything smells SO good, and I love the fact that they don't do animal testing and their products are all natural. I have several of their lip colors, which are very moisturizing and last forever. My favorite product is probably their bath bombs, they all smell amazing, it's hard to choose! Everyone who works at the store is super friendly and helpful; returns are a breeze. They are a little on the expensive side, but so worth it! If you enjoy baths or beauty at all, Lush is a must-go!

Veronica from Table Tops just did my friend's wedding, who I was a bridesmaid for, and all I can say is WOW. She did a fantastic job, everything was perfect and beautiful. All night long guests were complimenting the flowers and decor; it truly turned out to be a magical event. I sure wish I knew about Table Tops for my wedding! :)

They have great prices, and are quick and do the job well. I just got our comforter cleaned, they did a great job removing all the stains and getting it to look like new, all for under $20! Plus they have a super quick turn around, if I knew that it was that easy to get our blankets dry cleaned I would have done it a lot sooner

We love Whole Foods; great food, lots of fresh, organic options. The people here are usually very friendly and helpful. The location is very convenient, right off the freeway and just minutes from our home. It's so great that organic/natural foods are becoming more the norm and not the exception

Update 7/21/14:  The owner of Camelback Moving called us personally to discuss our concerns.  He was very apologetic and even went so far as to offer us a discount of 50% off our move and even sent us baseball tickets.  Suffice it to say we were surprised to receive the call and will certainly consider using them again due to their customer service.

This was my first time getting my eyebrows professionally waxed, and I was initially very nervous about someone touching my brows! They paired me with Alyssa, and while I'm sure all the girls are great, she was beyond amazing and I'm sticking with her :)   She was super friendly and made me feel at ease, and she listened to my needs/concerns. The process was pretty painless, and the results were amazing. I'm very happy with the shape of my brows now, and definitely can tell the difference.   I now go in every 4 weeks for maintenance, and pluck strays in between. It's always great getting them done, I feel so polished and pampered :) Highly recommend Alyssa at European Wax Center in North Scottsdale.

OMG, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Brio location! Practically every single time we go there, we have exceptional service and tasty food (the bread is to die for!). If something's not right, they fix it right away.   My favorite dish is their beef medallions...I don't know what's in the sauce, but it's addicting! And their desserts are good too. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance to it, it's very rustic and relaxing.   I highly recommend trying Brio out if you're in the mood for some good Italian food and great service!

So this was my first time getting any kind of blow out, I had to know what the big deal was. They had a great Groupon offer, and I  needed profile photos taken for my site, so I scheduled online, which was a breeze.   Very cute place, loved the theme and decor, the receptionist greeted me right away and was friendly. After just a few minutes of waiting my stylist person got me and took me back to get my hair washed. There wasn't much of a scalp massage, which I was looking forward to, and she asked me if I wanted the deep conditioner mask. Thinking they were trying to upsell me, I declined. Later I realized it was included in my Groupon, and I wish I had known that.  The stylist did a good job helping me decide which style to get, and explained the products and what she was doing. Overall it went well, the blow dryer was a little hot sometimes but I told her and she turned it down. My hair is long so it took a good hour.   Afterwards my hair looked and smelled amazing! It lasted the whole day, and looked great in my photos :) And even the next day, it still had some good texture and volume. I definitely recommend this place, and will probably go again next time I want a sweet blow out or updo. At the very least, looove their products and bought some to try at home :)

This place is really a great idea if you need frequent adjustments like I did for a while. Dr. Steve is fantastic, and really takes his time getting to know you and your needs. I don't know how he does it, but he always remembers every patient's name and what's going on! The hours and location are very convenient, and the other staff are always very nice. I ended up cancelling after a few months, just because I stated physical therapy and no longer needed the frequent adjustments.

I just went to a mixer/networking event with a friend, who's a member, and I must say I was pretty impressed. The location was great, the food they brought in was good, and most importantly, everyone there was incredibly nice and friendly. I normally have a hard time breaking the ice with lots of new people, but the way everything was organized made it really easy to meet with people and exchange business cards. I even met the president of the association, he was a pretty cool guy. I'm 99% sure I want to join ASBA over my local chamber of commerce, just have to find the budget for it. But of course it doesn't hurt that's it's $50 cheaper ;)

I had high hopes for this place, it was trendy and in the middle of Mill Ave...but their food was disgusting! They only had half a dozen items on their lunch menu, so I got a regular cheeseburger and fries, medium.   The fries were ok, nothing special, but the burger was so gross I couldn't even finish a 1/4 of it. The meat was like frozen cafeteria patties, and was mostly this weird white stuff (fat??) It was cooked well done and had zero flavor.   For a place that offers such few items, you'd think they'd make them amazingly. Not this place. I'll take a pass next time I'm in Tempe.

This is my fav place to go for a pedicure. The prices are fair, and most of the people there are nice. Love the decor and ambiance. They practice really good sanitation, maybe too good, I wish they didn't wear gloves the whole time, the texture is weird and then I feel like I'm the one with cudies. Be sure to call ahead and schedule an appointment, every time I go there they are packed.

I've had some Botox and Juvederm done by Charles at Glo MedSpa, and both experiences were great!   Charles is extremely nice and very professional, he takes the time to listen to your concerns and addresses them. I had a lot of questions, and never once did he make me feel stupid or foolish for asking them. It's obvious that he takes his practice seriously and genuinely cares about his clients.   What I really appreciated was that he doesn't try to push you into buying or getting more than you need. I personally wanted something more natural, I'm very pleased with the results! He has great talent/techniques and will make sure to get it right; I didn't feel rushed at all.  Booking was extremely easy, his office is clean and a convenient location, and prices are competitive. If you're looking for great skin care, look no further :)

This review is long overdue, I've been seeing Brian from Essence for a while now. He is definitely my go-to guy when my muscles need help! Unlike other massage therapists, who just massage where you tell them to, Brian actually listens and understands what's going on, and addresses the underlying problem.   He goes through great pains to make sure that I'm comfortable during the whole session, even adding some essential oils to help with my congestion! He does great work, I usually get deep tissue massage or hot stone. I've had several hot stone massages before, and Brian is by far the best--hands down! It takes a special person to really "get" massage and it's healing powers, and Brian is that person. Recommend him 100%

So we saw PVRIS last night, great show. But this venue sucks, and mostly from the people that work there. Standing in line wasn't so bad, the guy checking IDs was cool and making jokes with everyone.   But once we got in and found our spots, I wanted to look around. Headed up stairs to the balcony area, where they have seating. There were no barriers to entry, took the elevator up. No bouncers or anything. I found an open area and was looking around (this was before the show even started), and this security guy came up and very rudely told me to leave, that I wasn't allowed up there,VIP only. He was really being a jerk about it, and followed me back downstairs.   Later, during the show's intermission, I needed to sit down for a bit. Due to health issues, I get tired very easily and am in pain if I stand for too long. They have NO seating (unless you're $VIP$ upstairs, apparently). So no chairs anywhere. Zip. None. So, like a few others, I found an inconspicuous spot to sit on the floor against the wall. Not two minutes later, another jerk security guy told me I had to get up. WTF? Even the Marquee has plenty of chairs and areas to chill during a concert.   The acoustics are also somewhat lacking; for a concert/show theatre they should be better. Sound was quality was meh. Stage is small. The floor is level, which is odd; good luck seeing anything if you're short or in the back. Water is $6, ridiculous, but expected.  So to recap: venue itself, 4 stars; personnel, 1 star. Maybe they're used to dealing with dumb kids or something. Don't come here if you need to take a rest during the show, won't happen.

I love my Tae Kwon Do family! Mr. Wilcox, the chief instructor here, is great. He is friendly, funny, patient, and an amazing martial artist! We like Ms. Weisser too ;) The classes are structured, fun, engaging, and challenging. Other students are respectful and make great friends.  To give this review context, I need to rewind 15 years: I got into martial arts when I was in high school in Washington State and trained for a couple of years, getting to brown belt. For misc reasons I dropped off and went about my life. Fast forward to the present...   Now married and a working professional, I wanted to get back into Tae Kwon Do (I hate traditional exercise, and missed the activity as well as practicing self-defense). I remembered how much I enjoyed ATA and so found the nearest location: Lee's ATA North Scottsdale.   I was greeted with warmth and felt welcomed right away, and they were happy to let me come in at my last rank, so there was no need to start at white again. It's been about a year and half since I've arrived, and am about to test for 2nd degree Black Belt. Thanks to the dedication of our instructors, I have achieved my goals and continue to enjoy this martial art!
