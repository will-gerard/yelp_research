I adore the owners of this restaurant, Kim and Greg, and L'Amore is home to some of my favorite Italian food in the valley.   This is a lovely little place. Both the decor and ambiance are classy and invitingly warm. I also have to say I am impressed at the level of service every time I come here. What a gracious, attentive wait staff!  I particularly love patio dining (when weather permits) with all of the beautiful trees that line the outside of the restaurant. There's a very sweet, romantic vibe here that I really love. This is a perfect spot for date night.  The food is excellent as well- love the bruschetta and pizza. Also I'm a notorious calamari hater but somehow, I can enthusastically grub on the calamari they make at L'Amore? It's just that good I guess!

Loving Hut has a new fan!  I've read comments from fellow Yelpers regarding slow service but can happily say we didn't experience this during our visit. We were seated quickly, ordered our food quickly, and had it brought out very expeditiously. Granted we went on a slow Sunday afternoon.   My friend and I ordered some great appetizers to start- she had the summer rolls and I had the spring rolls. Both were uber tasty. The tofu in the summer rolls was excellent and I honestly can say that these spring rolls were the best I've ever had. Really scrumptious!  For our entrees, my friend had the "steak" and potatoes (she seemed to really enjoy it) and I had the BBQ Noodles.   I thoroughly enjoyed the golden rolls that came atop the rice noodles and the noodles themselves, but wasn't a fan of the vegetable protein "meat" slices. Unfortunately, Fresh Mint in Scottsdale does a similar dish and their faux beef is head and shoulders above Loving Hut. It's seriously unparallelled. Perhaps had I not had anything to unfavorably compare it to, I would have loved it though?  I also thought it was weird to include lettuce in a hot noodle dish. They were a totally unnecessary addition.  I ate a few bites and didn't ask for a box which I think offended the woman who waited on us. Sorry ma'am- it just wasn't good, no offense intended. I loved everything else I promise! ;-)  Anyway, for dessert we ordered the raspberry cake and it was so friggin delish...yum, yummity, yummers! It was sweet, super moist and just incredible. Being the sugar fanatic I am, I cannot wait to go back to try their other desserts!  Overall, despite not liking my entrée, I was impressed with the majority of the food and their wildly extensive menu and will definitely be back!

I've been going to this location since March 2014 and can safely say it's definitely the largest and best equipped gym I've ever been a member of.  It's huge. Extensive cardio section complete with TV's on pretty much every single machine. This has become a MUST HAVE for me! I'm hugely disappointed that the three other clubs I've been to in the Valley (Paradise Valley, Shea Blvd, and McCormick Ranch) do not have TV's attached to the cardio machines. I simply don't have the wherewithall or the attention span to do 40 minutes on the stairmaster while looking at a friggin wall. I need something to distract me from the torture and my own personal TV helps accomplish that.  Great amount of weight machines at this location but I wish the free weights weren't relegated to the one sad wall in the back of the gym by the mirror.  Haven't used the pool or sauna but they seem to stay clean and well maintained.  The final attribute which I think deserves kudos is the amount of group fitness classes they offer. As a cycle junkie, I love that they have spin class in the evenings...Monday and Wednesday at 6:45pm with a terrific instructor, Whitney. I work in N. Scottsdale and can say that most of the other clubs do not have evening spin classes- I've looked! They're impossible to find.  I also have to comment on the hours as this is the biggest thorn in my side- I'm not sure what MENSA genius decided that staying open til Midnight during the week but closing at 10 on Friday and 8PM on Saturday was a good business plan. What an idiotic strategy. Most consumer driven businesses need to gear their hours toward when people have the most leisure time to paronize said business- this would be ON THE WEEKEND when less people have to work!  It's really too bad there's such inconsistency with classes and equipment with LA Fitness as a whole though. I'm moving closer to N. Scottsdale in a few months and will be cancelling my membership because none of the other clubs in that area have the features, size, equipment, and classes that I currently enjoy at the Greenway locaton.  All in all, this location seems to be the best they have to offer aside from the foolish hours of operation!

Best pizza I've had IN ARIZONA. PERIOD. HANDS DOWN.  As a girl born & raised in the Midwest, I'm accustomed to good pizza....good Chicago-style pizza that is: Hearty sauce and thick crust. So imagine my dismay upon relocating to AZ & being inundated with piddly thin crust pizza everywhere (like having pizza toppings on a Saltine cracker IMO) with weak sauce.  Luckily that's not the case with Spinatos! The Sicilian style pizza is exquisite. The crust is thick, the sauce is robust & sweet, and the cheese is pure perfection. They add spices on top and it really enhances the flavor!  Anytime I venture out & try a different pizza place I wind up disappointed & compare it (unfavorably) to Spinatos. Well, I'm DONE trying new/different pizza joints. Screw variety, Spinatos is the spice of life!

Brought two pairs of pants here to have the hems let out and less than 60 days later, the bottoms of BOTH pair are coming undone. Very shoddy, poor quality work. The old woman who runs this place clearly needs to just retire already.

Definitely my fave bar to come watch NBA games at! This place is packed with TV sets facing every seating option they have available and the food is great. The atmosphere is chill and the service is always very good.  The grown up grilled cheese is a delicious, crispy treat and the pizza is some of the best I've had in the valley. Especially noteworthy considering it's thin crust and I'm not usually a fan of thin pizza. Luckily, this version is a soft crust- not a hard, cracker-esque like abomination like so many of the other spots in town.  They also make killer drinks. Love both the moscow and cranberry mules!

Oh em gee. Baker Wee has some of the best cookies I've ever tasted! Why can't this place open up in Scottsdale? Well, on second thought, never mind- that would be to my waistline's detriment!  Anyway, I happened to be in this part of town for a volunteer event at ASU West and stopped in this bakery on a whim. I ordered a few large sugar cookies, a few small thumb print cookies with vanilla frosting, and lemon, carrot cake, and pink champagne cake balls.  Everything was scrumptious!!   The cookies were perfection. Really sweet & delicious. Loved the frosting on the thumb print cookies.  The lemon cake ball was moist & so intensely flavored! Yummm! I loved the pink champagne flavor as well. The carrot cake one was good too. The cake inside the cake ball by itself was amazing-but I think a cream cheese frosting would taste better than the vanilla they used.  All in all though, everything was fantastic. And reasonably priced IMO!  Highly recommend the sweet treats of Baker Wee!

My only recommendations as far as Grapevine goes are the following. READ THESE VERY CAREFULLY!  1.) Eat before you come. DO NOT EAT HERE! The food is absolutely terrible. I ordered potato skins sans bacon and fried shrimp. The potato skins were absolutely slathered with a glob of processed tasting cheese and dripping with oil. The shrimp was wretched as well. When I bit into it, grease shot into my mouth and it's literally all I could taste. It. Is. BAD! The rest of my friends were disappointed with their food as well- one ordered gnocci pasta and it looked abysmal. Also, this was some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Once we sat ourselves, it took our waitress more than 30 minutes to notice we existed and to maybe come take our freaking food & drink orders. Getting her attention for refills the rest of the night was a huge hassle as well. 2.) Come for the karaoke only. Their catalog is insanely big and the crowd on a Friday night is extremely enthusiastic and fun. Some talented singers in the bunch too! 3.) Bring Clorox wipes or Purelle to "anoint" the mic before you use it. This is VERY important! Approximately TWO days after my karaoke adventure here (in which me & my girl group sang three songs) I came down with a vicious illness- coughing, body aches, sore throat and then laryngitis. I have no doubt where I got it from- the skanky microphones at this dive joint! All but ONE of my four girlfriends also got sick with a similar virus two days later. Unfortunately mine was the most severe. Don't take the chance- sanitize that germ-laden mic before you sing!

I eat here a few times a month because it's convenient to my home and office. If I'm with co-workers we will dine in, but usually I order online & just pick it up. They generally have your food ready in 15 minutes or less which is awesome.   If you do dine in, they have a cool soda machine with dozens of flavored soda and juice options. I love the Hi-C fruit punch because mentally I'm 5 years old.  Oh and if you're a fan of tofu- definitely try theirs! It's excellent. If I'm in "diet mode" I'll just order tofu with quinoa (that's their new grain option and it is really good IMO), and some veggies and it makes for a delicious, healthy, protein-packed lunch.   When I'm not in "diet mode" (which seems to be most of the time lately- eek!), I'll order the honey seared shrimp, add tofu, with quinoa and veggies. It's really good for "fast casual"!  Pad Thai with tofu is also yummy!  I think my only issue with Pei Wei is, they are way too heavy with the sauce 80% of the time. Often I will ask for my sauce on the side to avoid this.  Also, don't leave without taking copious amounts of the fortune cookies they leave out. I fill up the bag with handfuls of them every time and no one bats an eye!

Dined al fresco here on Valentine's Day for brunch. The limited menu, watered down, overly iced white sangria,  and forgetful waitress (or chef- not sure which) are the only reasons I'm giving this establishment four stars instead of five.   It was otherwise very good.  I ordered the superfood salad with kale, pomegranate seeds, sweet potato, pistachio nuts, quinoa, and dried cranberries. I asked for sauteed salmon on the salad but out it came with no salmon unfortunately.   I was too hungry to send it back, so I ate it as is. It was excellent! So good in fact that I'm going to try and replicate this magic at home in my own kitchen!  I won't forget the salmon though. ;-)  The waitress did give me a free "birthday" dessert (despite the fact that it wasn't my birthday) to make up for the forgotten salmon, so that was nice. It was some sort of brownie entree. Not my fave, but it tasted pretty good.  I just wish they offered a few more non-meat centric items on the brunch menu for those of us who don't eat land animals.  Would definitely try for another meal here though- perhaps dinner. The hotel and grounds are absolutely lovely and the live music was a nice touch. Classy joint!

Pita Jungle is home to some of the tastiest hummus that has ever passed through my lips! The original version is delicious but the cilantro jalapeño? Out of this world!! It's especially good with the homemade pita chips they serve.   Talk about tantalizing the taste buds!  I'm also a big fan of their falafel and that amazing four cheese quesadilla which they make with lavosh bread. Really, really yummy!  My absolute fave though is the Mahi Mahi. It's always cooked & seasoned to perfection and pairing it with the cilantro jalapeño hummus & pita chips is a combo that can't be beat!

Wow, what a difference two weeks make! I visited LGO yesterday after being kindly contacted about my previous review and the unsatisfactory service I received and felt compelled to update my review.  Our server was fantastic this time around. No sign of Crabby McCrankypants...maybe they sent her to that island where the misfit toys go?  Anyway, our server was uber attentive and downright cheerful- very welcoming. I appreciated this a lot and it really changed my outlook on this place.  In addition to my usual (reliably delicious) pizza, I ordered the smoked salmon salad and it was awesome. It had dried cranberries, cous cous, corn, and sunflower seeds. I should have asked for cheese though because I'm one of "those people"  who doesn't love a salad unless it has cheese. I'm pretty juvenile that way.   For dessert, I had the A to Z cookie and oh em geee was it scrumptious! It had peanuts, pretzel pieces, and a plethora of other tasty add ins that made it MY NEW FAVE!  Very very pleased with LGO and looking forward to my next visit.

Definitely one of my new favorite places. What a stunning restaurant. In a gorgeous location by the water. With an awesome atmosphere AND great music. This is a sophisticated, classy joint and the service did not disappoint either.  The sweet potato cannelloni is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted. I cannot WAIT to go back!

I adore Harley's. My absolute favorite pasta dish in the valley is their gnocchi with pesto sauce. I could eat this stuff every day of the week. It's decadent, full of flavor, and cooked to absolute perfection. While I thoroughly enjoy their standard tomato sauce and vodka sauce, they don't compare to the pesto sauce. I would PAY for the recipe for that pesto sauce. It really is stellar.  The bread they serve is also wonderful and addictive.  The few times I've dined inside rather than picking up my order, the service did leave a bit to be desired. It either seemed like they were understaffed or simply inattentive. Never anything overly annoying though. And the delicious food more than compensated for any minor deficiences in service!

I'm a regular at the location on Greenway in N. PHX but this location is closer to my new job so I decided to try it & to see if it was comparable.  It was most definitely NOT.  While the Greenway location is huge and sprawling with new equipment / TV's on every cardio machine, this place was the polar opposite. No TV's. Equipment was old/outdated, everything is VERY close together/claustrophobic, the layout has no rhyme or reason, and it smells HORRIFIC.  I walked in, looked around, barely let the stench sink in before I was hightailing it out of there. Yikes.

If you're into healthy, vegetarian & vegan food, this is most definitely your spot! The ingredients are always fresh, seasoned well, and cooked to perfection.  It could use a facelift & some better decor- especially if we're going by N. Scottsdale standards- but I can't find any fault with the food.  Faves: Summer rolls (the peanut sauce is TO DIE FOR), soy lemongrass beef, pad thai, and the imperial rolls are absolutely delish! Can't recommend this place enough!

Truly one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale- and that's saying A LOT as we are blessed with an abundance of exquisite food here.  Came here for the first time on a first date and absolutely loved every moment -company included! ;-)  Firstly, the décor, ambiance, candles, and dim lighting here is really beautiful and romantic.   I had a superb white Sangria and we ordered the tableside guac and housemade chips to split. It was a generous helping and both were astoundingly delicious. I will say that while the guacamole is stellar here, it does not (IMO) unseat the undisputed Guac champion- Barrio Queen (which is right around the block).   The chips were better here though.  Main course- I ordered the Florida Grouper with Paella reduction, banana crab croquette, brussels sprouts, crispy quinoa & pickled gueros. This fish was SO BOMB. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Who knew Grouper was so good? The brussel sprouts (which is not my fave vegetable by any means), crispy quinoa, AND the crab cake were also uber yum-tastic!  My date had the Alaskan Cod which came with Purple & romanesco cauliflower, toasted farro, leek & garlic mote & smoked pasilla sabyon- he raved about how tasty it was.  For dessert we ordered the fried bananas which came with dulce de leche ice cream (or gelato?) and this outstanding peanut butter moussey-stuff on the side. So freakin' yummy OMG.  It's pricey, but 100% worth the cost. Will definitely return!

Mozell has been my hairdresser for several years now & I love her like a sister.  Unlike a lot of hair stylists, she's very gentle on your hair. I am infamously "tender headed" but with Mozell, it's never been an issue. I almost forget she's even touching my hair when I'm there.  Additionally, she uses high quality products, and is a master colorist.   Her pricing is reasonable & fair as well which cannot be overlooked here in the land of "exorbitantly high priced Black hairstylists".   I also have to remark that she is extremely personable, charming, and fun to talk to- which definitely helps pass the time.   All these things combined make Mozell a local treasure! I can't imagine trusting my hair with anyone else.

I really wanted to like this place but other than the bruschetta, the food was terrible.  I ordered the pasta with Alfredo sauce and grilled shrimp. The shrimp was edible enough but the Alfredo sauce was SALTY AS HELL. It tasted as if an entire dump truck full of Morton's had been emptied into it. It was almost painful to my taste buds!  For dessert we ordered the mango bread pudding and it was just abysmal. The flavor was just off. Even our waiter (after he noticed we weren't eating it with any enthusiasm & had a ton left over) admitted that most people don't like it! He said the flavor was "hit or miss with customers- mostly miss".  Ugh. Not sure I'd give 5th and Wine a second shot.

Love Mijana- home to some fabulous belly dancers and the best paella I've ever had!  Came here with girlfriends on a Saturday night and enjoyed what can only be described as a "bevy" of terrific dancers. We arrived at 7:30 and when we left well after 10pm, there were still new girls coming out to entertain! I love this about Mijana and I love that the women were of various ages and body types. Score for diversity!  On to the food- I ordered the hummus which was absolutely delish, and the paella which was to die for! It came with saffron rice, tomatoes, cucumbers, mussels, and shrimp. It was so so good! My only wish is that this place was closer to where I live! Will definitely be back!

Not much good to say about RnR other than the fact that it's like a brunch nightclub- Pumping music, beautiful youthful crowd, trendy, industrial-esque surroundings.  We called to make a reservation for an 18 person party a month in advance and called three days before the reservation to change the number from 18 to 25. They told us it wouldn't be a problem at all!  Well, WHEN WE GOT THERE THEY COULDN'T FIND THE RESERVATION.  They "apologized" but we had to pretty much wing it which left a bad taste on all of our mouths.  So...we got a table upstairs that seated 6, pushed another table that seated 4 next to it and had to have the rest of our guests sit away from everyone else at tables of two. It was a hot.mess. and we were not.happy.  The $18 bottomless mimosas were watered down.  They had a menu full of frozen margaritas but weren't serving any of them the morning we were there.  The food was below average. I ordered an omelette with potatoes, cheese, and avocado. It was super dry (overcooked) and ultra bland.  This was my first visit to RnR and it will absolutely be my last.

I love this location of Wildflower. It's always so clean, is pleasantly decorated, and the service is always very friendly.  The shortbread cookies are to die for and I absolutely LOVE the chopped salad with salmon. It has red pepper, sunflower seeds, dried corn & cranberries, couscous, and FETA CHEESE, which is the correct cheese for a salad!!*   *Not that HORRENDOUS abomination known as "goat cheese" that so many establishments try to foist upon my delicate palate.*  They also have a perfectly tasty pasta menu after 3pm every day.   I only wish they allowed for online ordering so I didn't have to wait for my food during their busy lunch rush. Why is this not an option yet??? We are in the 21st century! Please make this happen sometime soon, mmmk Wildflower?

This is a gorgeous little place with uber cute decor. Unfortunately though, out of the 3 items I purchased, only one tasted good. The plain shortbread cookie gets a big thumbs up from me. Nice flavor & very light texture. However the cranberry orange shortbread cookie was A CULINARY ABOMINATION along with the pink champagne cupcake.   They were very, very sweet and really had an unpleasant taste I can't fully describe. With regard to the cupcake, both the batter AND the frosting were offensively bad. This is a rare & spectacular failure. In my experience, it's usually either the batter OR the frosting that's icky. In this case it was BOTH! Ick and yikes!  I am someone who has almost NEVER met a dessert/baked good I couldn't finish. I am a sugar aficionado to my core. I can choke down even the most mediocre of cupcakes. Because sugar = life. So the fact that I took a bite of each of these items and then promptly tossed them in the trash surprised even me. Also it's mega overpriced. $4 for this repugnant cupcake? This place needs to pick a struggle- crappy taste AND expensive? In what universe does that fly?!

Because this place is so close to my home and my office, and is reasonably priced, I'll give it another try in the future. But for my first visit, I wasn't bowled over. The decor and atmosphere of this place is great. No complaints there. Our server was friendly and attentive, so no complaints there either. But I ordered the Pad Thai for lunch and while it tasted good, I was seriously disappointed to receive a HUGE serving of rice noodles but only THREE medium sized shrimp in the entire dish! Honestly, a serving of noodles that size should have had double that amount of shrimp.   Hopefully they'll do better on my next visit or there won't be a third!

I wanted to love this place because it was a) 3 minutes from my house, b) cute, and c) the servers were always nice. However, it simply wasn't meant to be. The food here is just not good.   The pizza I ordered on the first occassion was oddly juicy, soggy, and cardboard-like (pesto, cheese, onion, tomato).  The pasta I ordered on the second visit had NO TASTE AT ALL. It was like that stuff in a can from Chef Boyardee. Bland and crappy. Luckily I ordered it via take-out and was able to season it myself at home with organo, garlic salt, and onion powder to make it edible.   You'd think I'd give up after two terrible experiences, but I'm no quitter! I took my brother there for a lunch date and suffered a 3rd disappointment- The calzone I ordered was the same soggy, cardboard tasting mess as the pizza I had there the 1st time. Except the tomato sauce tasted of cigarette ash! UGHHH!

Butters is HANDS DOWN one of my new favorite breakfast/brunch spots in town and my only disappointment is that I didn't discover this place sooner!  I came here with five coworkers for brunch and ordered the "build your own omelette" deal and it was terrific. The omelette was enormous (honestly looked like at least 8 eggs!) and it came with breakfast potatoes and two large pancakes. They really do give you A LOT of food for $10 bucks which is becoming increasingly uncommon in Scottsdale.   I love that they don't "a la carte" you to death the way so many other brunching establishments do!  Anyway, I loved absolutely everything- the omelette was extremely tasty (could've used a bit more cheese though), the potatoes were lightly cooked (not burned to a crisp like so many places!) and really, really good. Also the pancakes were fluffy and flavorful.  Most of my coworkers ordered salad or sandwiches with fries and honestly I was salivating over their plates as well as mine. Everything looked SO delicious- especially the French fries. I must try those on my next visit!

A "restaurant" (not a nightclub) charging $20 for entry during Super Bowl weekend...and no, that $20 wasn't going toward the price of your meal or drinks. They expected us to pay them just for the pleasure of entering and then pay AGAIN to eat.  Businesses who do this have the worst kind of ethics and I'll never patronize again just based on priciple.

First thing's first- if you're a single woman under 40 and looking to mingle with attractive fellas below baby boomer age, this is not the place for you!!!!! My girlfriends and I were very, very disappointed at the lack of 30ish guys both times we went.  Secondly- this is an adults only nightclub that bleeps the curse words out of the songs they play. Additionally, most of the music is lamestream R&B from the 90's.  Thirdly- the only wine they serve seems to be "Sutter Home" and the champagne they serve is subpar. We asked if we could bring our own champage on NYE (even offered to pay a corkage fee) and were told no.  For Superbowl Saturday they had TWO bartenders for what looked like a crowd of 200+ people. It took almost 30 minutes standing at the bar to get a drink. Atrociously understaffed. Awful service.  I really don't think much more needs to be said. Would not recommend.

Truly the best vegan desserts in town. Without question! The cookies are yummy, the peanut butter chocolate bars are epic, and the tsoynami are reminiscent of a Dairy Queen Blizzard- except made with soy or coconut milk ice cream and way more delicious. On my last visit I had the banana cream pie flavor with vegan vanilla wafers and it was SO COLOSSALLY DELISH! I adore this place. To the owner(s): Please branch out & open up a spot in Scottsdale!

I really, really love Green. It is one of my favorite vegan/vegetarian places in the valley. I truly wish they would open a 3rd restaurant in Paradise Valley or N. Scottsdale because never have I been disappointed with ANYTHING I've eaten here.  The animal fries are smothered in cheese, onions, thousand island sauce and are sinfully delicious and worth every calorie.  The crab puffs are to die for an taste just like actual crab meat.  The eggless rolls are insanely good.  Thai peanut bowl is yumtastic.  The imitation "Big Mac" (called a big WAC) is my absolute favorite veggie burger OF ALL TIME.  However, I will say that while I enjoy the thyme fries ok, there should be an option for just PLAIN French fries and it'd be nice if they offered sweet potato fries as well.  Still love this place and I never neglect to head over to Nami for a delish sweet vegan treat after dining here!

Hands down, the best guacamole in town. The absolute BEST! The pomegranate seeds are a freaking genius touch! I love that they make it for you tableside so you can ask them to add more or less of the ingredients you prefer.   Also, the best red sangria I have ever tasted and I am a sangria aficionado!   Can I also say the seasoned French fries are on another level delicious? Ahhh so yummy! I absolutely love Barrio Queen. My only complaint is that the last time I visited I felt like they skimped on the fish in my fish tacos. Definitely won't keep me from coming back though!

Very impressed with this place! Not only is it a great space in a great location, but the service was very good & the food was tasty!  We tried the following: homemade wine cooler (blueberry & hibiscus), fried green tomatoes, fingerling potatoes, and pizza with onions and mushrooms. All were absolutely delicious. While it doesn't beat Spinatos (best pizza in AZ) it's definitely excellent quality pizza. We weren't feeling adventurous this time around, but next time I'm totally going to give the sweet potato pizza a shot!

I wanted to love this place but frankly, my first experience there was a big ole "meh".   I have to say, we went on Memorial Day and Old Town was pretty much a Ghost Town. Thus, Chop Shop was NOT BUSY. And definitely not busy enough to have me wait 20+ minutes for a damn salad that had no cooked ingredients to justify the wait.   I ordered the Danish salad. The menu says it's chock full of goodies like arugula, greens, almonds, pears, apples, dried currants and dates...when it arrived it had a ton of greens, almonds, and dates but only two slivers of pear and three skinny slivers of apple. Basically I was expecting some robust fruit chunks and Chop Shop wasn't down with the program.  So in conclusion: boring salad and terribly slow service...not enthused about the possibility of coming back here but perhaps it's worth a second try some other day.

The shrimp was honestly some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend the corn creme brûlée as well- it was exquisite. There's also a super delicious potato dish with onion & gruyere (I think) that is positively to die for. Excellent wine selection and fabulous service as well! I only wish it were less dark / better lit in the restaurant!

First and foremost, this is a very, very cool looking place. Love the architecture. So unique!   I came here with a large group at 3pm on a Sunday. Unfortunately the service was abysmal.   We had a young, blond, male waiter who was constantly forgetting to bring things our group had either ordered or asked for. Several in our party ordered the special "all you can eat" taco deal which serves approximately two tacos at once and then requires you to order another two each time you're ready for a "refill". Our waiter repeatedly forgot to bring several of the people in our party their taco refills. I ordered a kale salad (which was delicious) so I didn't have this problem personally, but it was annoying to witness nonetheless.   I loved my salad. Would have loved not to have to ask for water twice, a drink refill twice, and a "to go" box twice when I was ready to leave! I may give this place another shot but only in a party of two or less. I won't go with a big group again.

If you enjoy being served wine out of a DIRTY A$$ wine glass, come to The Attic.   There is noooo waaaay the waitress didn't notice how absolutely filthy my glass was when she served me. How dreadful & disgusting!  I won't lie- the pizza was delish but with one caveat: eat it all at the restaurant and don't take it home. The crust is weak and thin and even trying to reheat it the next day in the oven results in a limp pile of pizza-mush. Thumbs down.

I'm a big fan of Smart Gym. High tech equipment, an abundance of free weights, dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells, TRX, and a great variety of weight machines. And most importantly (to me at least), the cardio machines all have TV's with dozens and dozens of channels (unlike Most gyms who either don't have TV's on the machines OR they do but only have 10 channels and 8 of them suck). If I'm on the stair master or arc trainer for 40 minutes, I need a TV to take my mind of the agony I'm putting myself though. This is not negotiable.  I've only taken two cycling classes here but I truly enjoyed them. Both instructors were great & played awesome music. The cycling room is pitch dark (which helps keep the room cool temperatures wise) and lit with black lights. They keep it very comfy with blasting AC and low ceiling fans. I wish LA Fitness would take a lesson from Smart Gym with regard to this!  Overall I love this place! I frequent three gyms and this is by far my favorite!

Mediocre pizza. Drinks watered way down. Service also mediocre. And to add insult to injury, there are no misters in the outdoor seating area. In the hottest desert climate in the entire United States. I have never ever been to a restaurant here that doesn't have misters. Is that even legal?!?!  Needless to say, my first trip to Pizza People Pub also served as my last.   *Parking situation is also a travesty*

I will first say that the food we had was fairly good. The order consisted of shredded pork, shredded chicken, mac n cheese, fries, and onion rings.   However, I must submit a one star review due to the company's unprofessionalism and tardiness in delivering our catering order. We work for a large bank and had planned a lunch function for our group. I asked that our order be delivered at 11:45pm today. In anticipation of this lunch, many people had foregone breakfast and by noon were getting restless. Hoping this 15 minute delay wouldn't stretch out much longer, I called Arizona BBQ Shack and spoke with Valentina (the woman who originally took our order 5 days prior) to check on the status of the delivery. Well, it was soon apparent that she had completely forgotten about our catering order. She assured me they would arrive with it in 15 minutes.   I wasn't convinced this would happen and of course my instincts were correct.   Our delivery didn't arrive until almost 12:45pm- AN ENTIRE HOUR LATE. We were given a small discount and free delivery, but this was of little consolation. Many of our people had meetings scheduled around this lunch and our intention to eat together as a team and engage in team building exercises was completely ruined due to this company's extreme lateness. Unfortunately they are unreliable and we would not recommend this establishment for catering if timeliness is a concern.

I'm writing this review in the hopes that anyone considering spending their hard earned dollars here thinks twice.  I brought my Chrysler Sebring into Gio's because a mile high parking lot speedbump assaulted my front bumper. I also needed a new rear bumper due to a hit & run from an Audi driving NASCAR wannabe Scottsdale douche.  My first impression of Gio's was that it was definitely "low budget" due to the shack-like atmosphere & the complete lack of air conditioning in August. Instead of "judging the book by it's cover", I allowed the positive Yelp reviews to persuade me into believing I could get quality work here. #BigMistake  They quoted me $550 for new front and rear bumpers. They also quoted me a two day turn around time. Brought the car in on Thursday, can come back to get it on Saturday. As I'm paying for this out of my own pocket & not with the help of any insurance, I was not intending to rent a car to add to this expense. I'm thinking- I can kick around the house for two days...sure it's an inconvenience but I'll live.  I give a $140 cash deposit for parts and to my dismay- they don't have a shuttle or anyone really to drive you home. So I spent $10 to get a cab back home.  Saturday morning comes & I get a call from the woman at Gio's. I'm expecting her to say "Your car's all ready for pickup!" but instead she says "There was a problem with your paint job and we have to start ALL OVER. We need an additional two days to complete the job."  WHAT!?  When I pushed her for an explanation, she tells me the "chemicals" caused the paint to bubble. and "it happens sometimes with CHEMICALS".   I had made a gaggle of weekend plans by this time and had to break down & rent a car. There's $150 in addition to the $550 in repairs to Gio's. I was LIVID.  So Monday rolls around and I call Gio's at around 10am to check the status of my car, which they've now had for four days. I get a vague answer from the woman who works there "it's in the paint room & no one can go in there. Let me have someone check & call you back."  Cut to three hours later and still no word from Gio's. I hop in the rental car and drive the shop to demand answers. "Oh no one called you back?" the woman asks cluelessly. My car was not even on site. I found out that Gio's didn't do the work at the location they do business out of. They took my car to some other location to fix it. What the #$^& kind of ghetto operation are they running down there?  Anyway, she makes a call & tells me the car will be ready by the time they close which is 6pm. What a coincidence. My rental car is due back at 6pm. It's 1:30pm so I have no choice at this point but to go home & wait.  Well wouldn't you know it, 5:30 comes and NO CALL FROM GIO'S.  Time to drive down there & raise h#$%&.  My car is STILL not there. The woman makes another phone call & claims the person who is DRIVING MY CAR BACK TO THEIR SHOP is stuck in traffic.  My rental car has to be back in 20 minutes. I demand one of the workers follow me to Enterprise to drop the car off (since they lack a real "shuttle service" for these instances) and bring me back to Gio's.  Fast forward to after 6:30 (they're supposed to close at 6) some hillbilly comes driving up in my Sebring. I'm told to "be careful" because after two days, "the paint STILL might not be all the way dry". It takes every ounce of my being not to start knocking things over, shout profanities, & trash the place upon hearing this.  Appearances are deceiving- my car LOOKS perfect at first. I pay the rest of the repair cost, the woman from Gio's gives me a coupon for a free detailing service "for the inconvenience", she asks me NOT to write a bad review on Yelp (she knew Yelp was how I was referred to Gio's and that the positive reviews swayed me), and I'm on my way.  Less than a week later, my brand new front bumper is FALLING OFF. It doesn't appear to be fully bolted on AT ALL. To say I was furious would be the world's biggest understatement. I could hear the undercarriage of the bumper scraping speedbumps because of how low it was hanging.   2 days later I'm back. I showed them the failing bumper & demanded they fix the car correctly and call me when it was done. I was pretty abrupt but tried not to say much as I knew I'd lose my cool.   Three hours later my car is ready. I get the keys from the woman (Sorry, I never got her name) and she tells me "when you hit something, it caused the bumper to come loose". Um, excuse me? I didn't hit ANYTHING. The bumper is loose because Gio's sucks & does shoddy work. She proceeds to tell me there's a bump under there that wasn't there after they fixed it. Um, probably because it was hanging off & hitting bumpy roads & speedbumps as I drove for 2 days? Bottom line- Had it been installed properly the 1st time, we wouldn't be having this discussion.   So basically Gio's tried to blame ME for their failure- which was one of many at this point. Two words- NEVER.AGAIN.

Cornish Pasty...Mmmm so many carbs so little time! Oh how I love anything hot and wrapped in dough!  I enjoy most of the vegetarian pasties (eggplant parm and the greek with spinach, mozzarella, feta, tomatoes, etc.), but my absolute fave is the Cheese and Onion pasty. It is filled with potatoes, onion, rutabaga and cheese and it is just deliciously simple. In my humble opinion, ketchup needs to be your dipping sauce of choice when you're eating this baby. I've tried it with marinara but it just doesn't have enough "bite".  For dessert you cannot go wrong with the banofee pie pasty. Graham cracker crust, homemade caramel, fresh whipped cream and sliced bananas make this treat a MUST TRY. It is sooo gooood. And the Apple Caramel Pasty is a very, very close second. That thing is fantastic!  While I have patronized the Tempe location, I prefer Scottsdale. It's cleaner and there are far less hipsters in flannel shirts with huge beards strutting around.

Wildly expensive but also wildly fun, Topgolf is kind of addictive! I've come here twice in the last month- once with a group of co-workers for a team building activity and once on a date.  The food on both of my visits was unfortunately not great though.   The first time I came I ordered the shrimp cocktail and it was honestly disgusting. The shrimp itself was fine but seasoned with (I think) paprika which wasn't a good combination IMO. I choked it down but not enthusiastically. It was served on wonton crisp-like chips with uncooked onion, jalapeno pepper and funky tasting cocktail sauce. I did not enjoy it AT ALL. I dumped all the toppings off and ate the chips by themselves and only because I was starving.  The second time I ordered a quesadilla and it was also noooo bueno. The cheese wasn't fully melted and tasted kind of like a kraft single melted between two tortillas. The peppers on the quesadilla were cold and uncooked.  The guacamole served with the quesadilla was bland and mediocre.  The only thing I enjoyed was the cookie & marshmallow fluff dessert my date and I ordered. It was yummy.  The price for an hour of golf varies depending on what time you come. In the morning it's $25, from 12-5 is $35, and after 5 it's $45 per hour. I came after 5pm both times I visited Topgolf. For a group of five coworkers, $45 is a bargain. BUT for an intimate date with two people, it's a pretty steep price to pay. I think on future visits I will eat before I come and only get drinks & dessert here and I'll likely come in the afternoon rather than the evening.  One thing I have to give them credit for is that they make a major effort to keep you cool in the summer heat. They have numerous huge fans (with misters attached)  blasting every which-way and you definitely will NOT get hot here. Love that!

Love this restaurant! The salmon, onion, chive omelette is a fluffy, delicious delight. The pancakes are also perfect- sweet yet light. I was charmed by the ambiance & decor as well. I adore breakfast/ brunch and this is most definitely at the top of my list for brunch hotspots in Phoenix/Scottsdale. The menu here is insanely diverse & there's truly something for everyone here!

I'm usually not big on thin crust pizza but Geno's is so tasty! And the prices can't be beat!   I odered a slice with only cheese and somehow it was like biting into a triangle of heaven. I saw God. "Pizza God".   They are right in line behind my beloved Spinatos, as far as the tastiness factor goes.  The night I visited, my girlfriend and I were being total hogs and we both ordered pizza as well as french fries. I do not recall which fries she ordered (hers came with pepperoni and I don't eat meat), but she raved about them incessantly.  I ordered the greek fries to go with my pizza and OH EM GEE- they were SO BOMB! I cannot even describe the greasy, cheesy scrumptiouness in exact terms, but trust me, if you wanna break your diet (and I mean REALLY BREAK IT), come to Geno's for pizza & fries!!

This place is the size of a closet and unlike the huge, sprawling location on Greenway, has no TV's on any of the cardio machines and a fairly lackluster assortment of weights/ weight machines.   I really despise the lack of consistency among LA Fitness gyms in the Valley. I'm not sure why they'd build a new location in an upscale area of N. Scottsdale and not have the most sophisticated / updated equipment in it. Also, this location offers NO spin classes!!!!

Listen, I want to support this business but I cannot in good conscience give Lo-Lo's a good review due to the perpetually awful service received on 5+ visits to this location.  It truly does not seem to matter when you come...the wait for a table has never EVER been less than 40 minutes on any occasion that I've come here. Often, it's been an hour or more. This has been consistent during brunch, lunch, and dinner...on weekends and weekdays.  The only reason I continually subject myself to this is because when my family visits from Ohio, this is the only place they want to eat! And they want it almost every damn day! Argghhh!  Perhaps that is because of the storied fried chicken. As a pescatarian, I wouldn't know. The only meat I eat is fish. My family raves about this chicken though and claim it's worth the wait and poor service we receive in order for them to get it.  I'm skeptical to say the least.  Speaking of fish- I am less than impressed with the fried fish at Lo-Lo's. I've tried it twice and it's virtually flavorless. What I believe is happening is, they season the fish AFTER they fry it instead of before? I don't know, just a theory. I can't otherwise explain why it's so bland.  The fries however? Delicious!! I absolutely love them. I'm also a big fan of their omelettes. The waffles, while yummy, are always soggy and this ruins them for me. I like a nice crisp waffle. Not a flaccid, limp one. But every time I come here, that's what I'm served. Even when I specifically ask for it to be crispy/not soft. Very frustrating.  I also have to comment on the wait staff. Many of my servers have been perfectly nice people but ALL of them have screwed up my or my party's order on EVERY VISIT. They either forget certain things you've specified about your order, bring the wrong sides, or forget multiple times to bring napkins, drink re-fills, etc..   I really question whether Lo-Lo's hires people who are experienced at waiting tables or simply welcomes any old Joe off the street a job serving their customers. To be a good server, one has to have to have a good memory, be fast, and take proper orders. In theory, it seems simple, but in practice it's really not.   I truly hope Lo-Lo's will improve and warrant an updated review from me in the very near future, but I won't hold my breath.

I would deem Sorso Wine Room average and not particularly memorable.   The Riesling I ordered was mediocre and the waitress wasn't very helpful in suggesting comparable sweet wines. The happy hour menu was also very limited.  When I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich and chips, I was expecting house made, actual potato chips. Not kettle brand chips still in the bag. Struck me as tacky for a place trying to bill itself as "upscale". I definitely should have clarified before ordering! The sandwich itself wasn't very appetizing or flavorful either. Honestly it's not any better than something you could get at Subway for half the price. Between this and the horrendous parking situation at Scottsdale Quarter, I can't say I'd be gung ho about the possibility of returning to Sorso.

What a lovely little place this is! Uber friendly service too. Not only was our waitress very kind and accomodating but several of the other staff members as well as the owner greeted us throughout our meal to ensure all was well. I'm super impressed! Love the decor and the music they play. Not too hipster, but just hip enough.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were the absolute highlight of my brunch visit. So scrumptious!   I will be trying the cannoli ones next!

Absolutely LOVE Buck & Rider!  The restaurant itself is trendy and beautifully decorated with great ambiance. They play FAB music too.The perfect spot for a date night!  The house made bread with sea salt is truly the best bread I have ever tasted. EVER. I would bathe in this bread's yeast, it's so good. Totally worth every carbohydrate it contains!  My date had sushi and seafood gumbo and raved about the taste of both. He was a very happy man!  I tried the "Today's white fish" entree, which happened to be sea bass with broccolini. The fish had a nice, crispy, yet flaky outside and was tender and deliciously seasoned. The broccolini was ahhhhmazing too.  You better believe we'll be back!!

First off I'd like to say I would definitely give this place a second shot.   I came here last Friday night with a date and we both just ordered salad and wine. He reported his salad was "so-so" (he ordered a chicken salad that sort of looked like canned cat food IMO). I ordered a salad with salmon and avocado and can only say the same. It was average.   The menu here really isn't very interesting, unique, or adventurous unfortunately. Nothing really stood out as a "must try". I'd come back to try pizza or maybe pasta and the taste of one of those may or may not warrant a higher rating.

If you were a patron of the last version of Michael's on 7th Ave and hoped their reinvention would be better, you are doomed to be disappointed.  First and foremost, the music is still abysmal. Specifically with regard to their upstairs room which seems to be intended more for dancing since the downstairs has no actual dance floor.   When I come to a "club" environment, I expect to hear CURRENT music- Drake, Beyonce, Rihanna, DJ Khaled, etc.. Well, not on Michael's watch will recent music be played! The DJ apparently took a time machine back to 1998 and refuses to step into the present. Pretty much all they played the two times I've been here is Jaheim, Next, and other late 90's "smooth R&B" that is better suited for falling asleep to than dancing to. I honestly can't believe they insist on continuing to operate this way. The old location was the exact same way. It's sad really.  The music they play downstairs is even older- we're talking Evelyn Champagne King, Lakeside, THE WHISPERS! I felt like it was 1984 again and I was hanging in my grandma's basement.  Also, the demographic is all over the place, but mostly skews toward people well over 45. We are talking beyond "grown & sexy". Way beyond! I saw numerous elderly people there last week and this place is crawling with men in their 50's trying to play "cat daddy" to women in their 30's.   It's gross.  Also, their bars (both upstairs and downstairs) are still woefully understaffed and you have to wait forever and a day at the bar for a drink. Just like the old location. Two bartenders at each bar for 150+ guests? Pitiful. And clearly they don't care!  Lastly, to be charging women a $10 cover on a Saturday night is pretty steep when most of your clientele is CREEPY OLD MEN. Michael's should be allowing women in here free of charge. Or maybe they should pay US to patronize this joke of an establishment.   I honestly wouldn't balk at the cover if on my EVERY VISIT I didn't end up waiting far too long for a drink at the bar, not being able to dance to their boring, outdated music, and being leered at by men older than my dad all night.  I've been twice and I'm not enough of a glutton for punishment to make it a third. I'll hang at Casablanca Lounge or Bar Smith or literally ANYWHERE else that knows it's 2016, plays music from the 21st century, and attracts people born after 1960.

I absolutely despise the fact that Panera has replaced my beloved Paradise Bakery. The menu is so much worse. The food is so much worse. Everything about this place is SO MUCH WORSE.  Paradise had a great grilled cheese sandwich. Good quality, healthy bread and multiple cheeses. Panera has an aggressively disgusting version with a huge glop of American cheese (barely melted all the way) between two pieces of limp, non-crispy/soggy WHITE bread. It is horrendous and offensive on every level imaginable. My two year old nephew could slap together a more appetizing sandwich!  Today I tried the tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was pretty much ALL tomato & greens with literally NO mozzarella! Ugh! Terrible. The vegetarian tomato soup that came with it? Also terrible- flavorless and more of a thick pudding-like consistency than soup!  Luckily the cookies seem to taste the same, but they don't have all the options they used to. I haven't seen a delicious molasses cookie or a fab lemon zester cookie since Paradise Bakery cleared out of this place. What a shame. Definite downgrade. End of an era.  This place is trash. #TwoThumbsDown

Really wanted to love this place as it's super cute & trendy and very near to my home. Unfortunately, everything was fairly mediocre.   Ordered the Crown Apple Sangria to start and it was overly iced and completely bland. Almost didn't even taste like sangria...more like a cheap Boone's Farm wine? I thought maybe my palate was "off", but my date ordered the same and agreed.  Because we didn't have a "reservation" (at 5pm on a Saturday!) we were seated at a tiny table up front and denied one of the (empty) comfier looking booths. Due to that, we decided to only have appetizers and dine elsewhere which, if the taste of the appetizers is any indication, was a smart move.  My date ordered the soft pretzels appetizer which came with two dipping options: a poblano queso and a creole mustard. The mustard was awful and the queso was only "so-so" (see what I did there?).  I ordered the Lemongrass Caesar salad with shrimp. The portion size is tiny so do not bother ordering this as an entrée. The shrimp were nicely sized (it came with approx four) but the dressing was sparse and lacked flavor.   I paid $18 for a tasteless, itsy-bitsy salad with four shrimp.   Disappointed in Drexyl to say the least. I doubt I'd give this place another shot.

Surprisingly poor food quality & disappointing options at this place.  The name "Southern Rail" suggests the food has Southern flair which I would take to mean, plentiful seafood options. As a pescatarian, I was disappointed by the lack of seafood on the menu. Pork was flowing like water though.    So whatevs, I ordered the BBQ shrimp. Can't go wrong with that right? Ha! That's what I thought. Shame on me for assuming it'd be shrimp with BBQ sauce. Instead I got a bowl full of shrimp (head & eyes still intact) swimming in a sea of weird orange gravy that looked & tasted NOTHING like BBQ sauce. It was disgusting.  On the side I ordered mashed sweet potatoes and sadly, they too were abysmal. The "sweet" had been drowned in salty butter & odd spices that killed the essence of what a sweet potato should taste like.  I had four bites of "dinner", chalked it up as a loss & set my sights on dessert- red velvet cake.   Yikes. It was ALSO wretched. While the texture of the cake was moist & bouncy, the sickeningly excessive sweetness off the cream cheese frosting ruined the entire dish. I, a frosting junkie, did something I've never ever done before: scraped the frosting off & ate only the cake. Shameful but Southern Rail drove me to it. I won't be back.

This awesome coffee truck was stationed outside of my workplace today and it was exactly what I needed on this uber hot Friday!  I got an iced dirty chai with almond milk and this baby is hitting the spot! So tasty! This is premium, delicious chai folks.   Love that they offer almond milk (Um Starbucks, take note) too!   Very friendly, fast workers and a great experience. Don't be a stranger to our neck of the woods PourJo!
