I was looking forward to Shane's tonight. This location is training a new chef, however, and the chicken is overcooked and tough...that's the only reason for my less than great review this time.  Hopefully the next visit will be better!

Never eating here again. First, there was plastic left in my salad. The manager gave us a credit for a free salad on our next visit. Then, today I get chicken and rice soup with a spoonful of slimy texture about a half of the way through which made me wonder if someone had spit in the food. And toward the end of the bowl, I found a fly in my soup that blended with the rice. I only noticed it because of the wings... disgusting. After taking the bowl back to the front, the manager was sent out and he asked whether there was something he could help me with. I sent back my salad because my appetite is now gone. Apparently he had not even been told what happened. Once we told him what happened and asked for a refund, he gladly took care of it. So, points for customer service. None for the food.

This neighborhood cafe lives up to it's reputation. I think we've found our new weekend breakfast spot! The coffee is good, the food is great,  and the cozy feel and personal touch make you want to be a regular. We will be working our way through the menu, for sure. So far, the crepes are light and delicious, the Mexican iced coffee is refreshing, and my husband was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of the prosciutto in the California Benedict. Definitely worth waiting for a table if necessary...even an outside table!
