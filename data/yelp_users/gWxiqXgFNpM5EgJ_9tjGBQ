I've been living in the Mesa area for 10+ years now and had never heard of this place until last week when some of my friends who are Mesa lifers brought it up and couldn't beleive that I had never been. Several friends joined the conversation and all said that this was a famous local spot in Mesa and that they had the BEST sandwiches. So naturally, i had to check this place out....and it definitely lived up to all the hype!  I brought my wife as well who loves sandwiches and she couldn't stop talking about how great her sandwich was. I'll definitely be returning!

Stopped by 5 minutes before their closing time to order take out and they told me they were closed. Funny because their open sign was still on and there were people still eating inside. I used to run a restaurant so I know it sucks when people come in right before close but you always serve until closing time. You can start to close things down but can't refuse service just cause your want to go home early. Guess I'll take my service and money elsewhere. Tried their pad thai once before and wasn't happy with it but was going to give them a second chance and try something different. Never going back now.

It's just another Filibertos. Cheap food, cheap price. It's great for a late night snack or when you're really hungry.

Amazing!  Best steak I've ever had!  They bring your steak out served on a really hot lava rock and you cook it to your liking right there. They place sea salt on the rock before bringing it out and have an arrangement of dipping sauces if you'd like. Crazy how something so simple would taste so incredible!  The rock stays hot for a long time so you can make sure the steak is cooked just how you like it.
