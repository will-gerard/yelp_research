I have only eaten here a few times, but it's left an impression that was recently reinforced at the Matsuri Festival.   A friend and former co-worker introduced me to this place, saying it reminded her of her mother's restaurant food... her mother from Japan. After munching on the most ethinically eclectic breadbasket (read other reviews, it's so true!), I had the udon with tempura shrimp and OMG I was stuffed about halfway through the steaming bowl of slurpy good noodles, flavorful broth, and giant, meaty shrimp covered in a tempura that, amazingly, had not disintegrated in the liquid. True comfort food, but I will warn - you may become drowsy after eating this. It's like Ambien was the secret ingredient. :)   At Matsuri, the line was long (as they were at almost every food booth) and I will say the $7 may have been a tad much for the styrobowl of ramen with bbq pork slices, but that was quickly forgotten as I tucked in. The steam rising from my precarious bowl promised flavor and did not fail to deliver. The pork was oooh so good; even my picky 5-yr-old was slurping up the noodles and munching on the smoky-tasting meat. The broth was filling and so good, perfect for what turned out to be kind of a blustery day.   Yeah, there's a wait sometimes. It's a small place, and helloooo... if it sucked, there would be NO wait. Man it up and chat with a stranger. You'll be standing like 2 inches from them heheheehh.

I hate giving a chain more than three stars. This one is always super-clean, super-fast and super-accurate. I can't believe how fast the line moves, during the weekday lunch rush. I always feel like I've spent a tad too much for such run-of-the-mill Chinese food, but since I'm pretty sure that the secret ingredient in the Beijing Beef is crack, I spend it anyway.   Yum.

***Update*** So after visiting this place again today, to grab some lunch to go, I have to bump up my 4 stars to 5. The little strip mall where Pat's sits is under renovation, but they're taking it in stride. And I still got my 2 slices with topping and drink for under $4. I don't care that they forgot my pepperoni at first and I had to wait a whole 45 seconds or so. The pizza is just really good, the staff is friendly, and it is such a deal. And I never get tired of reading the randomly odd stuff on the walls... like how Sean McLaughlin stopped there for a slice after getting married... or a Xerox certification of Elvis' check for the purchase of three Caddys... or the poster for the maiden voyage of the Titanic. Just odd stuff, but I did learn today that they have a catering menu too.   A huge thank you to my friend Tina, for fronting me cash after I realized I didn't have any. They still don't run plastic under $5. Oh yeah, and after Tina went on and on about how she doesn't often find pizza she likes, I got an IM from her later... "yummy pep pizza". Yes, it is. :)   _________________________________________________  My hubby introduced me to this hole-in-the-wall joint. For under $4, you get a lunch special with two YUMMY slices, one topping each, and a drink. I like peno's... they came freshly chopped, sans seeds and membranes. My nose was melting, but I was happy to not get the usual pickled rings. No one I've brought here has said anything other than wow. Bring cash if only getting one special; they have $5 debit/charge minimum.

I've NEVER been happy to pay more than $4 for a 'grande'-sized latte... until I tried this place. It's on my way to the office, and I decided to give it a try. As already noted by other Yelpers, this place roasts its own beans, on site. I got a vanilla latte and wow... this is not Starbucks. This was a cuppa POW, right in the kisser. Loved it! You should check it out. =)

I'm such a girl about flowers, and this place lives up to its name. They advertise "$9.99 dozen roses", but I have yet to get those for anyone. Once inside, I get sidetracked by the tons of flowers, plants, stuffed animals, candles, etc etc etc and usually end up buying a more premium type of flower. Basically, I am a sucker for their marketing.   The arrangements are always beautiful, and the flowers last between a week and 10 days, depending. The staff is very nice, and some of the women I have talked with have many years of experience. Their work never disappoints.   I've bought lots of bouquets and arrangements here, from $15 to $60 and loved each one enough to secretly want to keep it. Highly recommend!

Yes, it's a Starbucks... what's there to Yelp about, you may wonder?   The staff. They're friendly and welcoming; they're prompt; and they're accurate. I frequent many locations, and have come to really appreciate these qualities. Great job, kudos to the team at this one!

Total guilty pleasure. My blood pressure probably jacks up faster than my ankles swell whenever I eat here, but it's just so stinkin good. My kids like the chicken nuggets too, and I like that I can get a cup of actual fresh fruit (not a baggie of apples) with their meals.   Last visit was this past Friday, and while the food tasted as chickeny and salty as ever (waffle fries, droooool), two things could have been different - the staff was very attentive with me, but what was up with sitting around and talking while other people were obviously waiting to place an order? Let's call it an 'area for improvement', because that is not my normal experience here. I'd hate for others to think it's not good and not return.    But for the love of Sasquatch, please, please, please clean and deodorize the kids' play area. One of my kids, the one who asked me to NOT roll the window down after I heard a distinct fart from the back seat, stopped playing and said, "Mommy, it smells yucky in there." Honestly. :P

Ok, four stars may be a bit high for first visit, but this place has great service, really tasty, greasy burgers and cheap Blue Moon... and with each one we drink, we are accruing points for more cheap stuff... woo hoo!   Try the Bacon Blue Burger w/fries ($9) ... yum! My guy liked the French Dip. Tater skins were super cheesy with lots of bacon, and much better tasting than expected.   Great service (our server was hot too lol)... never waited long for anything and never had to ask for refills.   Check out their karaoke contest - two performances left, Wed July 28th and Aug 4th, when the grand prize winner will receive $1000. Vote for my friend Julie! lol

This review is based on only a few of Karl's items.   Mainly... the 'Alligator'... for the pecan nut in you. Buy it. Eat it. Savor it. Curse Karl for selling it. Repeat.   So good.

My friend and I were leaving Ernie's, and my friend said something about always wanting to try the Dogg. So in we went. No cover, and a handy tub o' bottled beer right outside the door. We snagged a couple Coronas & lime ($7.50) and walked into the steaming interior. It is hot in here, folks, but not like ick hot. It's hot from the crowd of people crammed into a smallish structure, pressing against the bar, barking drink orders at smokin hot bartenders in skimpy tanks and spankies. People are filling the booths, sitting on top of the booths, milling around a covered pool table and basically making the place a maze. Looking up, the exposed rafters were just covered in probably thousands of bras. It was... awesome. Great music- a little Crue, a little Ludacris, you get the idea - and a Babe's-a-vu moment when the bartending chicks dance on the bar, swinging from the rafters and accepting tips in those spankies. I'm going to have to go again, and take the hubby along. He may not appreciate some of the wannabe Coyote Ugly patrons who get up to dance, but I'm sure watching a chick hula-hoop while hanging upside down (omg, those abs are to DIE) will make it worth the trip for him. Tee hee.

I went to a bachelorette party here, a couple weekends ago. It was held there because the bride really likes the Crown Kings, a local band, and they were playing there.   So, we reserved a 'surfboard' for our party of 20... which apparently does not come with enough seats for 20, even though we told them we planned to eat. After arriving, we were told a few times that it would be hard to get seats because they were a) remodeling and b) the new chairs were being held up in customs. Uh, ok. We ended up taking turns sitting on the seats we were able to beg, borrow or steal.   The food was mediocre (chicken with some kind of jalapeno sauce that wasn't a sauce and more of a blackened crust - super salty), and we had some pretty long waits in between rounds. Kind of amazing, when considering there was a whole table full of women looking to get drunk - easy money, right?   While the band wasn't my taste, the sound system was really good (translate: go outside and close the doors if you want to hear anyone else talk) and the bathrooms were relatively clean. The place was packed with a 30's-to-60's crowd.   On the positive side, the guys behind the bar pour generously. A rum and coke is more like rum and a splash of coke coloring. If you do happen to go, the frozen mango something with vodka is really good. The dance floor is full of friendly drunks, and the bouncers are quick to kick any fighters to the curb. (Yep, this did happen.)   I doubt I will be back here. This was (I think) my 3rd visit, with the previous one being about 5 years ago, and the only one where I actually ate anything. Not impressed... with the decent location and kind of cool decor, it could be so much better.

Half-priced margaritas on Saturdays? WOO HOO!   We've taken our family here for dinner, maybe 10-12 times over the past 9 years. That doesn't really represent how much we like the food; we're just usually shuttling around other parts of town.   So here's what to like:  1. Consistently good Mexican food. From their standard combos to the chef's selections, everything we've tried on the menu has been really good. Yum!  2. Chips & salsa until the cows come home. And it's really fresh salsa with super-tasty, hot chips in a bottomless bowl. Yum!  3. Fresh tortillas, hot off the press. You can even buy a dozen for about $4... it seems pricey until you taste 'em. Yum!  4. My little chitlins actually eat the rice and beans here. Nowhere else. Weird, eh?  5. Did I mention half-priced margaritas... on SATURDAY?? We got their jumbo-sized house margaritas for $4. Even better, the bartender did not have a light hand. The worst part was deciding who got to drink, and who had to stay sober to drive... lol  6. VERY reasonably priced. Dinner for five, with alcohol, was under $70, including tip... AND we had leftovers.  7. Their whole menu is available to-go. Score!  8. Friendly, efficient staff. I've never had to wonder where our meals, drinks or bill were, and everyone is smiling and courteous. BIG plus in my book.  9. Mariachi music... ole!   Not so great:  1. Yeah. It's right by Sun City, which means a lot of golden oldies. More power to them, though, as they appear to lap up those margaritas like water. Just wish they weren't driving after... :/ 2. The parking lot ain't great. This place can fill up, making parking only possible across the road... next to the railroad tracks. Meh.   So based on my scientific analysis above, this place is a good value for a great, casual Mexican dining experience. Great spot to hit, on the way to/from the lake or Vegas, or if you're a local!

Get in your car and drive. Take Grand to 101st Ave and take a suicide left (or right, if you're coming from East LA), park your car and go in. Seriously. You'll want to press your nose against the glass when you see some of the delights in their cases.   Want a black and white? CHECK. 2-pound double-seed rye? CHECK. Florentines? CHECK. Mini Napolean? CHECK. Pizelles? CHECK. Real chocolate-submerged Devil Dog? CHECK. Good lord, I could write this review all day and not completely list everything I've had. It doesn't matter, they're all good. And they use the old bakery boxes with pink & white string from a spool, it's so cool.   The staff starts super, super early and delivers a complete buffet of bakery madness. Absolutely awesome place to load up with a variety of after-dinner desserts for company, or at least pretending you are.   They do pies and cakes galore during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter, but there will be a line. Brave it.

Yeah, nothing's changed at this place. It's still a big bowl of freakin awesomeness. Our last trip, earlier this month, ended by walking out with a full cake, pastries galore, cookies, a rye, plus free peanut brittle and baguettes.   God, I love this place.

Ugh, I can't stand it. Every time I go into this place (which is only as often as my willpower breaks down), I walk out with at least $20 worth of pastries and such.   The almond horns.... omg... if you like marzipan, please, for the love of god, try one of these. Same goes for their raspberry tart, also with marzipan. I want to die every time I nibble these.   The single-serve fresh fruit tart... they make it full-sized too, with 24-hr notice. I don't know what kind of custard is in it, but it is heavenly.   The apple slices.... it is wrong, that these are so delectable. I got my dad hooked on them. Whenever I stop by, to load up on a few goodies to bring to my parents', I have to get at least one.   And seriously... someone needs to outlaw the damn devil dogs here. I donated one, with a bunch of bakery goods for my office fundraiser auction. I think I paid $2.75 and the damn thing sold for $7, with the winner proclaming he would have bid higher if he had to.   I read another review, about the 'Soup Nazi' equivalent behind the counter. I have never encountered this. Yes, they are busy at times, but always courteous and friendly. I'll admit, I know their inventory well enough to not ask many questions though. Yet to be disappointed, on ANY selection. Breaking my normal diet is totally worth the guilty pleasure that I get from this place!!!   I heart this place, so, so friggin much.

What's not to love?   Cool small-diner atmosphere, crazy good food, ginormous portions, decent coffee (so many places underestimate the power of a good cup of joe), and you can laugh at Guy's stencil near the register.   4-egg chorizo and jalapeno scramble... if you see it on the board, GET IT.

My family went to a late-night wedding rehearsal dinner here, served buffet-style. Our rather large party was seated on the patio. The kids had a blast, feeding the ducks and fish. While the pond was a bit... 'pond-y' smelling, I guess - it IS summer... it wasn't obnoxious and did not reach our tables. It was a very relaxing and inviting atmosphere.   Chips and salsa were ok, as were the salad, and the small tastes I took of the enchiladas and tacos. The chicken & steak fajita meat were awesome. I had to break my low-carb resolve to have some of the pollo fundido, though, and was glad that I did. It was really, really good. Really good.   Service was excellent. I've read the other reviews, where service is frequently panned. Our experience may have been better, since we had dedicated servers. They were on the ball, though.   Good tourista place, and I hear they do a pretty nice breakfast. Not really sure I'd consider it romantic, but could be, for some people. I'd take the fam again, when we're up in that neck of the woods.

This review is for dinner on Sat, Aug 20th.  My bro and his ladyfriend have wanted to take me and my man-guy here for a while. Finally hooked it up.   First impression... meh. It is ok inside, nothing fancy, and nearly totally empty at 7 pm on a Saturday... close to primetime dinner hour for nw Phx. Rut-roh.   Our server... servers?... could not have been more attentive, from the minute we sat down until we left nearly two hours later. Oh yeah, and they managed this as a steady stream of people began to fill the place. And more people. We ordered beef & chicken satay (w/peanut sauce & cucumber salad with chiles)... both excellent. Oh, and the chicken & beef cabbage wraps. The chicken was astronomically tasty, yum!! Beef was soooo good too.   Entrees, in order of yumminess: chile catfish (hot), pad Thai seafood (hot), chile eggplant with chicken (med-hot), and duck something. The first three were phenomenal, spiced perfectly to order, steaming hot fresh and just bursting with flavor. The heat was never overwhelming and easily dowsed with a frosty cold one. We ate ourselves silly, drank through countless stories and laughs, and walked out of there with leftovers for under $62 per couple. The man-guy and I cannot wait to go back. Food, service are incredible. The pricing makes this place feel like a steal next to other Thai spots. Ambiance is simple but I felt as welcome as a guest in someone's home.   A new favorite... love it!!

I've not hired Bruce, but have attended a few events which were catered by his company. Each one had a different theme - casual Hawaiian bbq, cocktail hour - and in each case, the food and service were just smashing.   The professionalism of his staff - at the grill, at carving stations, at the bar, at pretty much any point of contact - was just incredible. The host (various relatives) never had to worry about timing, keeping plates full or guests satisfied. I frequently heard other guests commenting about how wonderful everything was. Not one complaint, at least within my earshot - and I am the pessimistic type to listen for those. =)   When it is time to cater our own event, I will be calling Bruce.

My hubby and I really like this location. It's a PAIN to get in and out (sooo many confused people in that parking lot!) but it is worth the hassle. Super-fresh fruits and veggies, at excellent prices. I love having like umpteen types of apples to choose from. They carry a huge range of beauty and health items, including my stand-by Jason facial care products (SUPER CHEAP this week!). The bulk coffees - I know they're not the highest quality, but seriously, I love the Vienna cinammon and 'Cookidoodle' (guess they can't call it Snickerdoodle anymore) so much that I don't care. They carry some seriously tasty South American organic coffees too. My only complaint is that their meats are soooo super fresh, without additives, that we can only buy what we intend to use that or the next day. After that, we're taking chances. Their deli service isn't always that great, but I love that we can go get a sammich, munch down for a low price, then get the shopping done. And I can't get organic limeade so cheap, anywhere else.   Love it.

*Update* Oh... my... GAWD... what happened to you, Safeway?   The wine selection is about a third of what it used to be.   The bakery doesn't carry the yummy desserts that it used to.   The staff... WTF? Does Safeway not have a secret shopper program anymore? I had to return an item, which I had purchased yesterday, but then realized it was 11 days expired. There were SIX employees, literally standing around, as a manager rang up customers and handled my return. Does she apologize? No. Does she ask one of the employees to get a replacement? No... she tells me to go get it and come back to the CS desk. So I grab the item and go back... but she's ringing up another customer and I'm staring at 6 people, who just stare back. I was truly apalled, at this display of mismanagement and apathy.   This location started off so well, too. I guess that is what happens, as the real estate flopped pretty badly in this area.   Time to select the cheese to go with my whine elsewhere.  Down from 4 stars, to 2. Sad. Just sad.  ____________________________________________________ I don't care that Safeway charges a bit more for normal stuff. I just love this location. Friendly, helpful people, always yummy stuff in the deli, fresh veggies/fruits, pretty big wine selection for a chain store, and the guy in the bakery is an absolute doll to my cookie-grubbing offspring. This place is really convenient (gas station, gift cards, flowers, Starbucks) but it could have all that and I'd pass it up, if the people weren't so darn nice. Yeah, I know they do (or did) secret shopper, but the cashiers are always really fast, talkative (I'm a total stranger talker) and smile when I have to force my kids to put back the umpteen packs of gum they've grabbed. They make me feel welcome, instead of rolling their eyes when I can't find my card or just gossiping with whoever is bagging instead of saying 'Hi'. Plus, I usually don't have to play 'dodge the f'n shopping cart' in their parking lot. A little ambience goes a long way. You live out this way... try it.

Costco, I love you. Yes, I also love organic, mom & pop places but here on the west side bank of reality, those are few and far in between.   What's there to say? This one is never out of what I want or need. LOVE LOVE LOVE the fromage tasting adventures... who doesn't love a little triple creme now and then?   And may you always carry my beloved Joint Juice. Amen.

Seriously, no one has reviewed this dealership yet?   My hubby and I decided it was time to replace one of our two minivans. (Yeah, we're so cool that we had TWO.) I knew what features were priorities for me, but I hadn't made a final decision on the make/model to buy. I had shopped online for countless hours, then we went out and shopped all day... alllllll freakin day.   After zero success with dealers along Bell Road near the 101, we took a jaunt down south before heading home.   We pulled into Avondale Toyota and were greeted by Colton Grubb (why does that sound familiar). He was very relaxed, easy-going and informative. He explained their 'no-haggle' shopping experience philosophy, then helped us with any questions as we checked out what the used lot had to offer. We ended up finding an '07 Highlander with super low miles, a clean Carfax, for about $3K less than Blue Book.   Some things to note:  1) Their used vehicles are priced well below Blue Book.  2) Each vehicle's Carfax report is in its glove compartment.  3) Really, free pizza as we wait for loan approval? Sah-weet!  4) Big-screen TVs to watch the game as the pizza is scarfed down? Can I move in here?  5) The financing options were plentiful. I got a killer interest rate.  6) Colton was very professional, personable, helpful, and relaxed. He was the opposite of just about every sales guy I had encountered that day. As a woman, I highly value salespeople who talk with me as an equal, rather than talking down to me. He did this, effortlessly.  7) Everyone within their sales office made eye contact, smiled, and greeted me and my hubby. More than one person made sure we knew there was pizza.  8) Colton knew details about every used vehicle we questioned, Toyota or not. This is not always the case, with many dealerships.  9) During my experience, I never once felt defensive or like car sales prey. That is a huge deal to me.   Overall, this dealership was one which wanted my business, but their approach is more of a partnership than seller/consumer. Maybe it was because I was working with Colton; maybe it is how their management leads the team in general. It works, though.   Whatever the case, the experience was the most positive I have ever had, while purchasing an auto. I want to buy my next vehicle from this place, especially if Colton is still part of the team. It's been two months since my purchase, and I'm still getting follow-up calls/letters to ensure I am 100% happy with my vehicle... which I am.   (Oh yeah, Colton is the grandson of Lou Grubb, for those who remember that Phoenix staple from long ago...)

You want honesty? Here it is. I would not go to this store if it weren't for some of the prices and the proximity to my home.   The cashiers *may* be friendly - you never know. I usually end up listening to my cashier complain to the person bagging, about the previous customer or how many hours they have left in their shift. I've experienced complete transactions without making eye contact or more than a few words. More than a few times, I've had to trot back into the store and stand at the customer service desk, to ask my bread to be replaced. The baggers there seem to make it their goal to squash it. It's atrocious, it is crowded (which is good for local economy, but not my sanity), and the produce quality is usually sad. I once had an experience with the Customer Service, where they refused to sell do a $250 Western Union transaction without seeing my social security card - and were unable to produce a written store or Western Union policy to back this. I went across the street to Safeway, and had my transaction done within a few minutes. And I didn't have to show my SS card. I had it with me. It's the principle. Also, their gas station card scanners (for the discount) rarely work, so everyone stands in line. The last time I did that, I didn't even get the discount I had just earned in the store, and was out of patience to get back in line to ask for it. Fun stuff, man.   The positives, and basically the reasons why this place gets any stars and why I still go every so often: Their prices are usually lower than my preferred store, Safeway. When they have really good sales, the items are in stock, like their recent 'buy 9 items, get $9 off'. Wish I could say that for every store. Their produce leaves something to be desired, but they do carry items like lemongrass stalks, or watercress, and those are usually in good shape. The deli snail service drives me insane, but they have tons of Boar's Head for a decent price. And it's only a mile away.   Two stars for those things. If it were any further, I would not even go.

This place is quite expensive, for a fondue experience that was kind of lacking. We had the Margarita cheese fondue, which was pretty good (soft pretzels, OMG), then he had shrimp and chicken, while I went with prime rib. His was soooooo boring. Mine was ok. The broth was forgettable, but the horseradish sauce was really good. My breath, not so much, but it made the meat much more interesting. Decent assortment of veggies, but I felt like I was in Munchkinland, with the portions. The dessert... well, who can go wrong with chocolate and caramel? Only chocolate and peanut butter would have topped that.   The service was... mmmm, well, I went with my standard 18%. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good. It just was.   Two stars for the experience falling way short of the usual fondue expectation, and for having to stop and get a something to munch afterwards.

Peter Piper for grown-ups.   I knew we were in for an expensive evening here, but we wanted to do something "interactive and fun" (my friend's words) for a couples' date. For a grand total of about $175 for two, there were soooo many other things we could have done which would have included better-tasting food, better service, cheaper drinks, and better comedy. We had a great time with our friends, but we would have fun with them anywhere. At least the Super Trivia game paid off enough in tickets to bring home Fun Dip for my kids.

First timer, on a Saturday night. We got in around 1 am; we were listed so no idea what the cover was. Bathroom was tiny but at least it wasn't disgusting. Skipped downstairs (not my thing), went to the rooftop.   Yeah, why haven't I been here before?? Loved it. Packed like sardines, effen awesome tunes spun, all kinds of friendly peeps in the crowd, good drinks served by smokin hotties, just a freakinfunfest. I'll be back.

The hubby suggested Pappa's for dinner last Friday, during a rare and precious weekend without any kids. He had been craving it since a recent layover in Houston - he killed time between connecting flights with oysters and beer. I happily agreed, since this is a place that never disappoints, yet I rarely think of it.   The wait was quoted at 50-60 minutes, but we quickly found a couple seats at the bar. In nearly no time, we had a couple of good beers and a dozen oysters were being shucked in front of us. Yum... so big and meaty, with a really clean taste. There's no room for wimpy horseradish here, either, just the really good, strong stuff.   We were seated pretty quickly afterwards. Kudos to the staff, for immediately moving us (corner table, drafty and too close to wait station) to the inner tables, by the oil lamps. It's a dark, kind of romantic atmosphere. The service was excellent, very friendly, timely and efficient. Overall, I always like the ambiance.   Ah, the food. Hubby usually goes for fried fried with a fried, which has a good beer batter. I went for the single crabcake on a bed of crawfish. I'd order the double cake, but I can barely finish one! It's so good though. Topped with fried sweet potato garnish, the crabcake is thick, buttery, and full of lump crab meat. The light breading (probably panko) is very complimentary, and the crawfish... oh my, I could eat a pound of crawfish by itself (which is no longer on the menu, sniff sniff) but this crawfish is shelled and lightly sauteed in a buttery sauce with a hint of lemon. I will admit, it was a littel saltier than usual, this time, but not overly salted. I also had their wedge salad, but had to send first one back when it came with the carrots I had asked them to omit. The replacement salad came with croutons (which the first did not have), which I just picked off. It was a decent wedge salad - it's hard to screw that up.   This rich dinner left no room for dessert, but if there were, I would have gone for the key lime pie. Theirs is very good. Or maybe the bread pudding... yummy!   A very nice outing with my sweetie. Every meal I've had here, including happy hour, has been great, whether it is a simple dinner or special occasion. We will definitely be back.

Since my last review of Pappa, we've been back about eight times. In fact, six of those times were to celebrate my or my hubby's birthdays, which are two weeks apart. Last visit was last Saturday, the 8th; previous was Dec 26th. This review update could fit either visit.   Again- quoted 45-50 min wait, but vultured around the bar until a couple of seats opened up and dumped our table wait. It was CRAZY busy this time, with all of the folks in town for BCS, etc.   Oysters - wow. They were HUGE, delicious and showed up quickly. Our shucker even came by, after we were finished, to ask if we were happy with our order. Boy howdy, yes we were.   Hubby got filet mignon w/Alaskan King crab compliment; I got my usual crab cake on lemon-caper sauced crawfish bed (sweet potato garnish changed up to fried onion strings with a tomato-y relish on top, yum!). We were both 100% happy with the food. When I mentioned to our bartender (he gets his own paragraph) that it was hubby's birthday, he offered the normal comped dessert (key lime pie, MMMM), but threw in a bonus gift: the rum bottle token. It was appropriate; my hubby had sampled five different rum drinks during our meal. (Pirate Punch was my favorite!)   Ben was our bartender; he was just incredible!! Before we even got seats at the bar, Ben was asking what drink he could make for us. In fact, despite the extremely busy and loud atmosphere, his excellent and attentive service made it feel like he was our personal server - and I noticed that he was giving everyone around his end of the bar the same service. He is just that great! Or maybe he was just that happy that the Colts lost... :). Another 'tender, Kim, also kept a great eye on us and other nearby patrons, whenever Ben had stepped away. Our thanks to them both, for an absolutely fabulous experience which guarantees the future of our 3-year-old birthday tradition!

After getting 45 min to 1-hour wait times at Sandbar, Margaritaville, and Yard House (we had a movie to make), we decided to hit up this place and hit jackpot - only a 15 minute wait, spent comfortably at the very cool fiber-optic-like bar (seriously, it's way cool!), sipping cocktails that weren't a huge rip-off and watching The Game on a FRIGGIN HUGE screen. I secretly coveted that screen for my living room, even if it meant getting rid of everything else.   Our server was great, friendly, and quick. Their staff was on the ball; no one was standing around or looked like they'd rather be somewhere else. I ordered the bleu cheese burger with wedge salad (yeah, I like stinky cheese, wanna fight?) and the hub ordered prime rib dip. He said it was pretty good (which from him means, it's great) and my burger was incredible, cooked perfectly to order. The dressing on the salad was a little watery, more like ranch with bleu cheese thrown in, but edible. The lettuce was really fresh.   We were in a hurry, so I asked for our bill when our meals came, and surprisingly, it came within a couple of minutes. The server was our hero; we made our movie, just at the opening credits.   Only caveat... is anyone on staff checking the bathrooms? Paper products eventually do need refills. It's clean, otherwise.   Two enthusiastic thumbs up. It doesn't have the fun and games that the Scottsdale location has, but the service is excellent and the food is good. Plus the giant frickin screen that, one day, will be MINE. MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA........

This place is next to Margaritaville at Westgate... yes, on the west side. No, not in north Scottsdale... yeah, it's a cool name, but it's still not in Scottsdale... ok? Ok. I'll be honest, I had already had a couple drinks when we went here, but I'm pretty sure I did not pay a cover. Drinks were relatively cheap, barstaff quick and friendly, and the clientele didn't irritate the crap outta me with pretentious bs. Just a big room with a few big screens, a few conversation tables, long pub-style common tables to stand and drink with friends, and busy. No dancing (bleh, especially since they were playing decent music from 80's to present, alt rock to hip hop) but it would not be the same with a dance floor. Don't think I would have liked it. We did not stay very long, but surprisingly got a conversation table even when it was already pretty full. I'll have to stay longer next time, to see if I can bump this up to 5 stars. Oh and that guy sitting at the bar when I bought my friend a drink? We were not trying to pick you up (my friend's hubby was there), and if you had been a tad more friendly, your next Pabst Blue Ribbon would have been on me for being nice to my friend on her birthday, but thanks for giving us something to laugh about. Just sayin. :)

Three of my friends and I went here to get pedis for my friend's bday. She kind of blindly picked a place (I don't regularly do mani/pedi, naughty me!) and we met there. For a smaller shop, they sure pack of lot of activity in there. Several spa pedi chairs were placed in a ring, facing outwards; probably 8 or 9 of them. This was cool, because we could all be done at the same time, but kind of disappointing because we tend enjoy encouraging each other to misbehave. Yay for text lol. We all got the same pedi special, 'Happy Feet' ($40, penguin notwithstanding) which included the usual spa pedi services plus paraffin bath and neck massage. They had a cappucino sugar scrub, which put me in heaven. One of the techs was keeping us laughing, with his constant chatter and witty remarks. "Happy Feet mean Happy Face". My tech was really good, thorough and efficient. The neck massage was eh, but I was not expecting some deep tissue therapy while waiting for my waxy feet to moisturize and my calf pores being invigorated with steaming hot towels. She did pretty good percussion, which I liked more after a few seconds. My friends also seemed pretty happy with their results; I did not really hear any complaints. I was last to sit and first done, with french tip and the infamous $5 flower on each big toe.  Like I said, efficient... but I did not feel hurried. She got a really nice tip, for making my normally bleh feet really, really happy. I hope to get her next time. Happy feet... happy face. :)

This place has one of my all-time FAVORITE Asian dishes - the Thai Spicy Noodles. Yeah, generic sounding as heck but it's really thin noodles with woked chicken & shrimp, scallions, egg, cabbage and I can't remember what else, with Thai spice. Squeeze a huge wedge of lemon over it and I'm in heaven. One order is enough to feed me, my hubby and our teen daughter, but we usually get two... it's sooo tasty when it's cold. Breakfast of champions. Their honey chicken is really good, in fact I can't think of any dish that we have not liked. Their appetizers are yummy, and they do both spring and egg rolls. That's handy for a family of mixed disciples. :)   The service is always very smiley and friendly, and there's never been a wait. Totally good Asian food for a very decent price, in a clean restaurant. What more could you want??

I don't know why, but I absolutely love walking into this theater. Looking around, I can hear "HOLLywoooood...." I really don't know what it is... the staircases, the crowds of people running around, the bright lights everywhere. But it's cool.   Never had a problem here, always got tickets fast at the box office or at self-service. Long lines at concession, but they seem to move quickly. Sure, there's popcorn and crap all over sometimes, but at a late Saturday show, what do you want?   Only negative is about these people who bring their newborn-to-preschool age children to rated R, or really late movies. It rips my heart out to hear "I'm scared, Daddy!" or listen to a parent scolding their kid for whining about being tired, and really makes me regret the $9.50 I spent plus $4.50 drink, when I get to hear a baby crying right through the dialogue. I know, I sound callous and I could go complain. I understand, yeah, maybe you couldn't get a sitter. Sometimes, neither could I. Know what I did? STAYED HOME.

I dunno about you, but we went to the library a lot when I was a kid. (Oh dear GOD, I just actually said "when I was a kid". Send me my AARP card.) I loved browsing the shelves for Harry the Dog, Curious George, Richard Scarry stuff, and later on, trying to surreptiously include a Judy Blume in between other, more 'innocent' books during checkout. There was no way my mom would have let me BUY a copy of "Are You There God... It's Me, Margaret", so the library was about the only way I'd get to read that forbidden fruit. Ah, Catholic school...   Yeaaaah so anyhew, now my family goes to the library every week. No joke, every week. I love being able to log into my account online from... wherever... and indulge my sudden whims by transferring a book, movie, CD, whatever piece of media, to my nearby branch and placed on loving hold in my name. My teen likes their anime selection; the little ones really like the little play area and huge selection of kids' books. Plus, they do kids' activities quite a bit.   My hubby has found really recent movie releases here, sometimes there is a wait. I think we got Order of the Phoenix about a week after the DVD came out. I was able to snag a copy of Arcade Fire's Neon Bible right when it came out, and was able to scoop up Augusten Burroughs galore shortly after Running with Scissors was released in theaters. (If you like neurotic dry humor, gotta check him out in nonfiction. I'm hooked.)   There are a ton of computers to use (never actually used one though), and the librarians are really nice. Kinda slow at times, but really really nice... and helpful. For the crap they have to put up with sometimes, gotta admire them.   All in all, it's a weekly trip we all really enjoy. The atmosphere is decent, and the bathrooms are super clean. We can pretty much get what we want, and I don't feel like I've been made to squeal like a pig, like I do when walking out of Barnes & Noble. Now if I could just get them to open a little coffee bar... :)   Minus one star for needing a bigger parking lot during turista season (yeah, like that spring training parking ain't gonna end up there... it's right across from the stadium) and having a door alarm that likes my hubby way, way too much.

Of course I'm a fan. There are NO OTHER THEATERS within a decent distance of this place! I'm just glad they're there.   Good things:  1. Rarely a crowd.   2. Tuesdays = $5.50 all-day movies.   3. D-Box available, if so desired (not a big fan but nice to know it's there)  4. Parking is never a problem.   Not-so-good:  1. Popcorn is meh here. BYOR (refreshments). They don't look too hard.   2. Really, that much for a super-far wesside theater? Don't you guys want to draw more business during a recession? The first-showing and matinee prices are 'ok' but c'mon...   All in all, it is an acceptable theater experience. What's really nice is that when the kid screaming behind me poops his/her pants, I don't have to think "... and I drove how far for this?" Sad, but true.

We avoided this place, for the first few months after it opened, just because it is hard to make a left out of the plaza that it sits in. Mistake! I really like the NY style pizza (by NY style, I mean crust is neither really thin nor really thick, really tasty sauce use sparingly, and lots of cheese), and just love their wings - nice and vinegary, with as much heat as I want or don't want. The service is always pretty fast, the restaurant is spanking clean, and there are big, flat panels hung around the place... and there's always a game on. They were running good pitcher specials, whenever the Suns played. I've not had their Sicilian style, sandwiches or pasta dishes, but from watching other patrons enjoy them, they must be good!   The most expensive item is NY style steak pizza or a specialty Sicilian, around $18, and a pitcher of beer is about $7-8. Wings run about $6 (10 piece) to $15 (30), and they do have an everyday special - the usual large pizza and 20 wings for under $20.   I recommend this place, for the locals. Time to dump Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's... this is a local business that is worth supporting!

I'll get the less-than-positive out of the way first. The wait. Ok, that's done. What's nice is that the wait can be spent seated on the loveseats outside, with heat lamps in the winter and an ice cold cocktail or beer in the summer. And I like the layout better than the Desert Ridge location. I always feel like I'm in a huge hallway there.   The staff is almost always very friendly (one off experience, but I think she was just having a bad day), the selection of beers and other drinks is endless, and the menu has something for just about everyone. The atmosphere is casual with a buzz in the air, and it's cool to look at the 'microbrew equipment'. It has to be for show, because I've never seen anyone near that stuff. Maybe someone knows different?? lol  The ahi tuna is mmmm mmmm good. If you're a salad lover, try the grilled hearts of romaine with gorgonzola vinaigrette. Ask for grilled chicken breast on top, if you're feeling carnivorous. Seriously, it is the best. And bring floss!

Best. Onion. Rings. Ever... EVER!!!   If I ever get put on death row, my last meal will be a hubcap full of Culver's onion rings. They are just absolutely perfect - light, crispy beer-style batter on thick, hearty slices of sweet onion served piping hot and in large doses.   Oh yeah, they have butter burgers too, which are good and greasy, blah blah blah, but the onion rings are to diiiiieee.... which is precisely why I am not allowed near this chain now. My butt is still mad at me for the last batch...

There's not much to say - just go try this place!   - The gyros sandwich is SO good - maybe a bit on the salty side, but kind of goes with the territory.  - The fries & tzakiki are like crack. Ok, they ARE crack, but they won't rot your teeth.  - The gyro salad is great. I go for this when I'm not in a 'bready' mood.   And, there's a YouFit for anyone who stuffs themselves silly and wants to work it off. Ha.   Great little local place with solid food. Don't let the tiny corner put you off - give it a try!

Wow. Just... wow.   My girlfriend and I made plans for a lunch date, deciding on downtown as our meeting place (she's in ultra-East Valley, I'm in uber-West Valley). My niece suggested this place, after I could only think of places which made my inner voice go 'meh'. Oh, I owe her.   Super-casual place, in a very small re-used house. Cool artwork (for sale) on the walls, great interior decoration, an overall nice ambiance. LOVED the musical selections. The volume seemed kind of loud at first, but I had no problem holding a conversation with my friend.   Quick, efficient, friendly and attentive service, even as the entire place filled up with a Saturday lunchtime crowd. I just wish I could remember the chap's name, to give him kudos. Hopefully, the 33% tip let him know our appreciation of his service.   I had the Great Divide 'Wild Raspberry' Ale from Denver. Yep, it's a girlie beer but wow, it was refreshing and berrylicious.   My friend Di and I decided to share the Artichoke Heaven with La Tolteca chips ($7) and Mindy's Mac and Cheese ($7). Both were served at the same time (perfect!).   The Artichoke Heaven was... heaven. Warm, buttery, cheesy, big chunks of tender artichoke scooped onto hearty tortilla chips. Yyyuuuummmm... super rich and indulgent. Well, I thought it was, until I tasted the mac and cheese...  My friend and I tried the mac and cheese at the same time. Several moments of silence followed, as one will do to show respect and admiration. The pasta was perfectly cooked (to me, this is the very important, as a limp noodle is notorious for spoiling a good time, tee hee), the cheese sauce was cheesy-good with a buttery richness and breadcrumby top crust. Oh yes, and the big chunks of fresh green chile baked into all of this. I swear, a chorus of angels somewhere broke into songs of praise. I have found my new comfort food!   What's really weird? We ate ourselves silly and still had enough for a third person. Well, a decent snack-sized portion of each lovely offering, anyway ;)   Highly recommend. I'll have to revisit the 4 stars for possible upgrade, after a second visit.

Wow. Just... WOW.   Groupon sucked me into committing, but I have wanted to try a float since watching Altered States many, many... many years ago. I wish I had tried this sooner, now.   All of the website info should be reviewed before taking 'the plunge', har har. Laying in an enclosed pod for an hour is not for everyone. For those who are willing to give it a shot, it may end up being an amazing experience.   The facilities are very private and clean (salt notwithstanding), the staff is super friendly, informative and helpful, and the experience is just insanely transforming. That is the most I have relaxed in MONTHS. The total lack of pressure on neck and spine is deliriously delicious. The sensation of buoying on top of 1200 pounds of Epsom salts in body-temp water is incredible. The option to snuff the lights and leave the pod closed gives total enclosure and complete escape from the world. For those who prefer, the staff will be happy to leave the music on for the whole hour, and the pod can be cracked open for some cool air.   I took a deeper plunge and bought a membership (no contract, month-to-month). The friend I brought for my first float loved hers too; my sis will be with me for the next one. I am so excited for her as she discovers this new experience.   Highly, HIGHLY recommend.

I feel weird about giving five stars to this tiny joint, but I can't give it 'only' four stars in good conscience. We live pretty close to this place, and have eaten here, easily, 30+ times over the past two years... possibly 40+. Not one time have we been less than happy as clams. The woman who runs the front (phone and restaurant... it's pretty impressive) always remembers us, is always nice and courteous, and super helpful.   My favorites:  - Thai Basil Beef with extra beef and medium spice. This is a dinner, a lunch and a midnight snack, easily. So, so much food, even without rice. I love that I can order as spicy (or not) as I want. When we followed paleo, this was my takeout go-to, and still is today.  - Egg drop soup. It is so yummy! No weird stuff going on, either; fresh veggies and super-tasty broth, served piping hot. This is a great value, at $2.95 for a large. This easily serves four people as an appetizer... orrrr one really, really hungry person who is craving some comfort food.  - Sweet & sour chicken. This is not your average S&S ck. The meat is completely identifiable and the breading is light enough to not weigh down the whole dish. Good sauce, too.  - No longer on the menu, but the Thai roll with peanut sauce. I really wish they would bring sexy back.  - BBQ pork fried rice, extra pork. Um. Yeah. Extra pork, because pork. Duh. This is a massive serving, too.  - Online ordering.  - The kid menu has pretty large servings, too.  - Clean.  - Great service, even if there may be a wait. (There's a wait for damn good reason, so relax.)  - It's been a while since we have done it, but this place was BYOB. Suggest calling ahead to make sure this is still allowed. We quit bringing our own because beer just takes up room that is better filled with tasty, tasty food.   My husband's list is undoubtedly even longer. We just love this place. Give it a try. DO IT!

I've been here four times, and each time, I get pretty much the same thing: bacon board; Sneaky Petes (no longer on menu, but ask for this tequila cocktail... yum!); and the wedge with chicken. All are dependable, yummy and MINE ALL MINE. Seriously, jalapeno bacon? Who read my mind and made this worthy creation, for which I'll always be grateful?   My friends always try different things, and being the mooch I am, when it comes to good food, I've determined that everything is worthy of trying.   Only area which could use *some* improvement - the service. A couple of times, during less-busy times, we have had to ask what happened to our server. Did we scare him/her away? :/   Go enjoy the smoky scents and tasty foods!

It's Sonic... it's a chain... so the food is rather predictable. Love me some jalapeno poppers - the best are here!   The crew is always super-friendly, and among the dozen or so times we've hit this location, I've yet to get a wrong order. That is a huge plus in my book, these days, sadly.   Thumbs up for a great job!
