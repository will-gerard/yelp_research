We really loved our dinner here...   the only thing would be that we felt slightly rushed to eat and all of our tapas were brought out at once to our tiny table... it would've been truly perfect if we were able to eat more slowly without the fear of everything getting cold. I would order things spaced apart next time,  AMAZING FOOD! To start with the almond type butter in the bread basket. They also agreed to some of my special requests... so. nice.  Our favorite was the stuffed mushrooms & the stuffed peppers. TO DIE FOR. The tilapia was brilliant and the salads were HUGE.   Red Sangria (which is a 4 day process) came in a large pitcher and did NOT disappoint!  We really wanted to try their house-made infused vodk, but they were out.   This place definitely lives up to the hype. GO! And affordable!

the most BEAUTIFUL hotel on the strip. DE-LUXE!!!! We had a FUN gondola ride through the Venice canals inside the hotel. Our Gondolier was Luciano... he had a beautiful voice, and a FAB italian accent... super fun! And it was only $12.50 a piece. The husband and I are DYING to go to Italy... so this will hold us over for now...

SOOOOOO disappointed! I have stayed at a number of hotels on the strip... this one BY FAR was the WORST!  Not even a coffee maker or mini bar in the room... we also booked a KING room... they gave us double beds. Very romantic, huh? The employees weren't very helpful, AND they charge $13.95 for internet.  They bathroom was grimy and the view felt like it was the butt crack of the strip.  Truly a disappointing experience. The casino was nice and the restaurants were OK... it's just the HOTEL. DO NOT stay here if you want a Vegas lavish room... go to the Venetian or the Bellagio or the Paris... even Mandalay Bay (even though they don't have a coffee maker... however, the beautiful bathrooms make up for it)  SO sad. Never again. Why was the Econo Lodge that was 44 BUX better than this???

Ambiance was stunning and romantic... we were celebrating being newlyweds... when we arrived we had a handwritten letter congratulating us from the staff. Service was divine. HOWEVER... we can't give 5 stars for our experience. We also have a feeling that Mr. Tom would not have been exactly pleased with the way some of our items came out.  The side of potato's weren't cooked enough. they were still hard in the center... the seasoning was delish... so we are sure that if fully cooked... they'd be great.  Steak was fine... We liked our Ruth's Chris experience better. The "warmed plates" and skillets, were not very warm, and our steaks were quickly chilled. The sweet potato side was cinnamon-y goodness!!  The cocktails... Raspberry Martini and the Agave Martini were to DIE for... The Bartender's better work it!!!!!! We were surprised with a comp'd dessert cause of our nuptials... and the Dessert Chef... WOOOOOHOO!!!! The vanilla bean cheesecake melted in our mouths... and it even said CONGRATS on the plate. So... the ingredients to our main meal were great... we just don't think they were executed the best possible. Maybe the Chef that night?? Who knows...

Jimmy Buffett would be ASHAMED with what is happening at this particular restaurant. I really don't see him kicking back with a margarita and listening to loud R&B music with flashing studio lights.  The ambiance was LOUD and frat boy-esque.  There were NO tables away from the blasting music... and it was quite dark inside.  The volcano nachos were weird... SERIOUSLY???? Cheese whiz on 15 buck nachos??? They were large in portion... but NOT worth hot dog stand quality cheese.  The soup i had was okay... nothing to write home about. We had to flag down a waitress about 4 times... but she WAS "swamped" so... who knows?! Margarita was alright... the atmosphere really ruined everything. NO GOOD.

I love breakfast. It is my favorite... so Mama might be a little picky when it comes to it.  Obsessed with this place. Amazing service, kind staff, & delicious food! A ton of healthy options! YES!   Not too far from the strip to check out... skip the buffets & overpriced crap and indulge in the homefries & the amazing banana nut muffins. The scrambles are ridiculous and i added the "sassy apples" to my cottage cheese.   Just GO! It won't disappoint.  Only thing I would want is a larger selection of coffee type beverages like latte's, etc...

They would get ALL stars if it was NON SMOKING. But alas.... it isn't...  I also love the fact that it feel upscale in the middle of what seems to be the downtown drug deals & annoying drunk tourists.  AMAZING SERVICE! Bianca was our incredible bartender!  Not only was she attentive but she gave us samples of things AND extra pours "to try" of other people's drinks. AMAZING.  I am sad that their website doesn't have the current cocktails, otherwise i would give you the actual names. wah. here goes...  I had the martini made with almond milk??!!! WHAT??? Oh yes... it was everything i LOVED in a glass... kinda like an alcoholic iced latte' w/ some sort of cinnamon or nutmeg around the rim. YES please.  The Gin, Orange Peel, Bitters & Absynthe cocktail was good. My hubby forgot that Absynthe tastes a bit like licorice... which he is not  fan of... he was a bit disappointed... but if you like that? go for it.  We also tried a Scotch drink, which my man LOVED!   Also some sort of lemon amazingness which was brilliant. I think "Jack" was in the title.  A truly amazing evening besides the cigarette smoke. wah.

disclaimer to start: I have been to quite a few raw/live restaurants. (wooohoo!) And DEF a ton of vegan ones. As that is my lifestyle. Not to mention the fact that as a part of my business, people pay me to create healthy recipes. Not only for people personally, but cookbooks, blogs, etc...including raw.   I have  even taught people how they can prepare delicious raw & vegan food at home in a class format.  On that note: We were excited to check this place out and taste another fun take on raw amazingness.  And sadly, from the moment the cashier opened her mouth the tone was set, it seemed. She was flippant & rude... especially when we asked to get almond "cheese" on 1 side of the "pizza".  The man and I both wanted to try and I am not a fan of nut cheeses. (or fake cheeses in general... or fake meat. For me... it freaks me out that something is not being what it truly is. I could prob say that's how I feel about fake people too! haha!)  That brings me perfectly into my biggest point...  Technically "raw" is anything under 119 degrees... SO, you could potentially  have warmed items that still maintain the delicious nutrients that all raw food offers. AND--- our fav places in LA do this.  For example... the biscuits and gravy do not come out ice cold. Same as their pizza.   The pizza was ice cold. And apparently every thing they serve is that temp. Or room temp. That really turned me off. I really don't know any time I would say... ohhh, I am totally craving a cold enchilada. I spoke with what seemed to be the owner to ask a few questions and of course... he was offended and will prob reply to this post. But alas... I am hoping it causes him to re-evaluate the temp? the service? As I know it is probably super easy to not have any worry regarding temperature.  The Buckwheat bread it came on was great! BUT--- we could've driven to whole foods and bought the same bread ourselves and assembled our cold dish at home. (especially with the price point so high)  The menu also said it came with "walnut sausage". Throwing small pieces of walnut on a cold piece of bread does not a sausage make. Another one of our fav places at home has an incredible walnut sausage... that is a delectable mix and packed with flavor... not just the walnut.  Which brings me to ANOTHER item on the menu they call "fries".... we were like... cool! Let's see the fun spin on "fries" done raw. Come to find out these are merely avocado slices. Just. Avocado. I LOVE avocado. If you say it's avocado. But don't tell me it's fries.  SO---  in a nutshell--- the flavors were actually quite good.  BUT--- I could buy at the store and assemble at home. (was hoping they built more ingredients in house, especially with the price)  Don't tell me things are NOT what they actually are. "walnut sausage pizza" is not cold store-bought bread with nuts on top. Fries are NOT avocado. And please make a disclaimer somewhere.... ANY where on the menu that says all of our food is served cold or at room temperature. (I know its a RAW place... but I know RAW... and it doesn't have to always be cold or room temp.)  then, we would know what to expect and probably really truly enjoy our experience.   Also--- a little kindness and maybe a crack of a smile goes a real long way.

If you have to and you need some japanese in your life I am sure this place will suffice.  You really can't beat their happy hour prices... but you get what you pay for.  It was hard to be a healthy pescetarian here. Lots of fried, lots of soaked in oil-y sauces, all of the specialty drinks have a ton of sugar.  The waiter even said that when he eats there, that he always double checks that the fish is fresh. So... sometimes it's not? Eeek.  Gosh, I sound like a brat. It was late and we were starving. It worked... but, we most likely will not be back.

NIGHTCLUB REVIEW ONLY:  GREAT SERVICE!!!!! NICE STAFF!!!! BUT------ If middle-age, mid-western women with no rhythm are your cup of tea, this place is for YOU! One almost broke my wrist when she tried to use my 110 lb self for leverage as she tried to climb onto one of the ledges you can stand and dance on...    lot's of literal "ho's" looking for the next John... you might not realize that is what she is to start, but as the night comes to a close, she hopes that you are drunk enough to take her home and pay top dollar.  if you are a people-watcher. you'll love it.

Good spot. Wish it was cuter & more home-y/warm inside. But the coffee and food BOTH deliver, so it's worth it. Although I would do a major overhaul on the signage outside and the interior. Make it look more inviting.  Vegan muffin was great! Moist & rich with blueberry deliciousness. Had a breakfast wrap with extra spinach and was quite satisfied. Great coffee too... YAY ALMOND MILK!   Overall YAY! But really---- she's clean, but if you want people to hang out for a bit... make it a bit more cozy.

Stay. At. This. Hotel.   Beautiful rooms, hotel bar, gym, spa services, heated pool, perfect location, intelligent staff, flat screen tv's, modern bathrooms, and affordable!!!  we would stay here again in a heartbeat!!! the best choice in edinburgh!  NOTE: we have found that you can get a cheaper rate if you book through a travel website partnered with a flight, and NOT booking through the hotel website.

Traditional Scottish fare. Awesome atmosphere. Perfect warm cozy pub on a rainy humid spring day.  I had the Meat Pie. WOOHOOO!! The gravy, the "chunky chips" (with malt vinegar drizzled on them)  The philo pastry dough placed on top of the meat. DELISH!  The pints are reasonably priced and the service is fabulous! There were more tourist than locals, but you got the delectable pub food/atmosphere experience without the stinkeye from the local peeps. Would definitely go back!

there must be crack in this yogurt. or some kind of addictive substance. i. cannot. get. enough. the taste is SO rich... and detailed. lot's of froyo places you kinda get used to the flavor being "light"... well, you feel like you are having a major indulgence with this place. and also the array of toppings is genius!  you cannot leave without at least SAMPLING the cake batter and peanut butter. Sign me up. Wish we had one of these in NYC. maybe i will open my own...

I absolutely cannot describe the amazingness that is La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop. Gourmet it is. From the top to the bottom. Service, Style, Food, the whole 9. Do not be fouled by the neighborhood... this place SHINES like a diamond in the rough.   I am SOOO bummed that we were only in Phoenix for the night, cause I would have set up shop here every night. THE SALSA BAR!!! AHHH! We tried EVERY ONE. AMAZING.   Our amazing bartender/server was David. He killed it. He even made me a Skinny Margarita. They make their own juices there for the Margs...mmmmm. Yep.   They are authentic. The fish is fresh. They put up with me wanting no oil and after ordering 1 taco... he put up with me ordering 2 more, after the place should have been closed. This was all done with a smile and kindness that is unfortunately rare these days.   Even just thinking about that taco... Grilled Mahi w/ a ton of veggies, spinach, onions,  wrapped in a homemade tortilla, guac, TONS of dipping sauces... literally melted in my mouth.  If you are EVER in the Phoenix area--- YOU MUST STOP BY. If I am even an hour with-in it's radius I will be running back.  Not. To. Be. Missed.

I am actually shocked I liked this place so much! I am never a fan of a sports bar type place and it seemed odd... like the decor didn't know exactly what it was wanting to be. Mexican-inspired? A TGIFridays? My Vegan tendancies are also quite hard to please in this type of situation. My poor husband, all the man wanted were some good Nachos.  To my incredible surprise they had a VEGAN MENU!!! I had to personally request it and there were a couple snags, (coming out first w/ sour cream... which is DAIRY) but I was extremely happy with what I ordered. They were eager to please and were extremely kind... so with a couple mess-ups I don't mind if the staff handles it in stride.  The hot salsa is a MUST TRY! Mmmm... I love it if I can still feel a little tingle in my mouth an hour later. (wow, that sounded dirty)  My husband got his Thai Nachos (which he LOVED), I got a vegan option and it was ALL GOOD. I still am not a fan of the decor, but hey----  you can't win them all.
