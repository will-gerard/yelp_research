THIS IS THE WORST MC DONALDS I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!  We live 2 miles from this mc donalds and have 4 kids that LOVE mc donalds so on busy days, after work, my boyfriend and/or I would drive thru this mc donalds often.  typically once a week. After having an issue every single time over a 3 month period, we finally started driving out of the way and going to a different location. While driving home today the kids saw this location and asked for mc donalds so, against our better judgement, we decided to give it another try.  Bad choice! The fries were cold and stale, as usual. And we were missing large fries. My boyfriend and I are both in the hospitality industry so we always try to see both sides and rarely complain. But we decided we had to say something  . So my boyfriend called and talked to the manager on duty and just explained our past experiences and how we gave them another try but that it was very dissapointing. He didn't catch the managers name the first time so I called back to ask and there were 2, Lisa and Melissa. The conversation he had with them is the absolute worst part of any experience we have ever had at the location. She was beyond extremely rude and showed no concern that we said we would not be back. She didn't offer to fix the problem nor did she car AT ALL. Again, we are in the industry but this is completely unacceptable. They deserve negative stars.

This place is the absolute best EVER! My boyfriend and I went to the one at 40th st and bell and gave it 4 stars, not because the pizza wasn't amazing but because he got a meatball sub that wasn't nearly as good as the pizza and we were really craving wings and they were out. Well, tonight my kids and I came to the 7th St and thunderbird location because it's closer to home. Wow! Just wow! As always the pizza is phenomenal but we also got the sweet chili glaze wings and they're the best wings I have ever had. The owner came by and talked with us and said hi to my 2 girls. This place is truly my favorite. This is my first ever yelp review so obviously that says something in itself!

Best nail salon ever. I have been going to Traci for a long time and she always does an amazing job. Her and her brother recently became the new owners of TIP TOE. The salon is clean and it's has an awesome atmosphere. Traci is amazing at nails. She's a true artist. I usually give Traci a couple colors I like as well as a few ideas and the nail designs she comes up with and phenomenal. I always get compliments :)
