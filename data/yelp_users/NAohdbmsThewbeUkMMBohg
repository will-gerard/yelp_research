I have been to 4 shows this season now and everyone has been better than the last! I did honestly think I would be bored with the symphony but that was not the case! They have an amazing line up of unexpected entertainment. From Jason Alexander, Human Nature, and ABBA to "a night at the Oscars," each show was unique, entertaining, and full of wonderful musicians. I have sat on the main floor and in the balcony and there isn't a bad seat in the house. Next season has posted and looks just as amazing. I am absolutely hooked!

I love our zoo! They are constantly expanding and adding to keep it updated. It looks like in the next week or so a brand new entrance will be done. I love the new Orangutan exhibit. It is very large and they come right up to the glass and watch all the people! You feel like they are watching you rather than the other way around! As a member this year they put together a great package with a refill cup for a $1 for each time you go. I love the new stingray exhibit where you can actually pet the stingrays!!! There are two new babys in the tank this week as well as a baby zebra who is still learning how to run. Fun to watch.   They have great events throughout the year and I especially love zoo lights which always gets me in the holiday spirit. The halloween activities are also fun for little ones and adults. The zoo always looks clean, well maintained, and there are always people around to tell you about the animals, answer questions, etc.

Tucked in a small hole in a strip mall, this little place actually serves really good food! It was on DDD for a reason!  Small but with charm and a really pleasant women behind the counter for lunch, we ordered and shared a meatball sub and italian sausage with sweet peppers sub. We also started with the prosciutto and melon. The appetizer was amazing, just like I got in Italy. The sandwiches were both fantastic, I am still trying to decide which was my favorite. They had plenty of cheese and sauce and were falling apart and messy and yummy just the way a saucy italian sandwich should be!  They have ice tea and a variety of soda's and italian sodas but they are in a can fyi. Tables are a little close but the food was worth at as well as the service. We did have a local dines voucher for half off the meal but the prices were really great. We really felt like we got out money's worth and would go back in a second without the coupon.  I will be back to try many more things on their menu!

I was very fortunate to be brought along as a plus one to the opening night of Giselle. It was a beautiful performance. Very professional, beautiful choreography, excellent story telling. The female leads stole the show. They both did an amazing job and are excellent dancers. I had never been to the ballet before and will now return wanting more!

Absolutely horrible service twice. The first time they told my mother to come right down and they could take her right back. I raced home from work and met her there where they said we will take you back in a few minutes. One and a half hours later they took her. It would have been fine had they said that from the beginning but you don't tell people "right back" and then have it be 1.5 hours. Second time we had an appointment and got there and after waiting 30 minutes past the appointment time someone came out and said it would be another 45 minutes. So what exactly was the point of the appointment I am wondering? No one ever apologized either time and said they were running behind or anything. In the future when we need x-rays/MRI's, we will be looking for a new place to go. Service here is just unacceptable.

I wanted to get my open water scuba certification and a friend recommended this shop. I was happy with the entire process. They explained everything I would need and all the costs. The classes were a good combination of pool, classroom, and then lake dives. Everyone was very helpful, patient, and the classes were even fun! They offer a variety of classes for all levels and also sell lots of different gear. I will continue to use them for additional training, equipment and for a trip at some point!

Went here on Mother's day. They had great specials, prime rib was good, cheese fries are the best around. Large portions, great service, love the juke box! This is the first time I ordered prime rib here. Not as good as the ribs, they have the best ribs, but the prime rib was a solid 4!

The food is absolutely five stars. However they have raised the price and taken away the salad, you now pay an extra $3 for a salad with the prime rib. Rarely do you find a place where a salad doesn't come with a steak and it makes it really expensive. The food however is always excellent. Prime rib, garlic mashed potatoes, creamy garlic dressing, croissants, and spinach dip are all amazing, some of the best ever! Service is always superb and your drinks are always full.

It took me two years but I finally tried something beyond the spinach dip and prime rib!!! The bbq ribs are wonderful. Tender, perfectly cooked and really good bbq sauce. I have never had bad service here and the food is always perfect. Charleston's impresses me everytime I go. I even stop for takeout for dinner sometimes and just get a spinach dip. It is pricey but for great food and consistently good service it is worth it.

Great way to get rid of the old and get some new books to read. They don't give you much for the ones you trade in but when you only pay $3 and $4 for books, it is an easy way to trade. Huge selection, always spend way too much time and money here!

Completely remodeled! So bright and open! Love it! The burger was great as usual. The condiment bar was clean with lots of fresh veggies and peppers and other fun things to top your burger. The new soda machines are so much better than the dirty fountain ones they used to have with the yucky drains. The fries are the best part. They have an amazing seasoning on them that I just can't seem to get enough of. The price... Under $10! for a burger/fries/and drink!!!! Just can't beat that.   I had strayed from Fudd's for a while and now I will return all the time. What a drastic improvement. I am going back for nachos soon. They really have the best nachos, despite being an appetizer, they are  whole meal they are so huge and have so much yummy goodness on them! I also love the buffalo chicken sandwich. It is a little more money than the burgers but worth it and you can pick either fried chicken or grilled.   Ok, enough ranting about how amazing this location is now with the remodel. But really, it does not look like the same place!!!!

Happy happy happy! It always sucks to get in an accident and have to deal with getting a car fixed. They were fast and easy lol! They set up an appointment exactly when I requested, I showed up and they took me right away. The car was ready in 4 days which was amazing. Other times I have had my car repaired it took a lot more time than this did. The job is well done and I have no complaints. The customer service was great, they kept me updated and took care of all the communication with my insurance. They made sure to call the rental car company to get me a ride. I would recommend them without hesitation.

I had some watches that five years ago I got batteries from here and I had warranty cards to replace the batteries if they died within five years. So of course a week before they expired two of them were dead. I actually found the warranty cards (I can't beleive I still knew where I kept them I sound like a very organized person). I went on down and within 15 minutes they had them both replaced. They quoted 20 minutes and came in under. It was no hassle, quick, and they were very friendly. So why 4 stars and not 5? Well the batteries were close to $50 bucks, but 2 of the 3 did get replaced for free, so that is like $25 each. However, I can go downstairs in Sears and get them done for $14.95 so even without the warranty (they only do a 1 year replacement) this is still a better deal.

This was the easiest furniture buying expereince ever. I had already bought he bulk of my furniture elsewhere and needed something a little more reasonably priced and so we went in the roomstore. The sales person immediatly helped us and wasn't pushy or annoying. He wrote down measurements for me, got us discounts, and arranged delivery all within less time than anywhere else I have shopped.   The customer service called several days before the delivery to confirm the address and then again the day before with the delivery time window. The delivery people showed up on time and were in and out in minutes and very nice. I was a pleasant expereince for something that is usually a hassle. This isn't the highest quality furniture but when you need something really reasonably priced, this is the place!

When you wake up on a Monday morning in a really bad mood because you are on your way to work and have a flat, anyone that can make that expereince painless and pleasant is well deserving of 5 stars!!!! This location is always fast, efficient, friendly, and reasonable. Once you buy tires from them they always do basic flat fixes for free. They also rotate and inspect for free. They get you in and out and are very friendly and a pleasure to work with.

I hadn't been here in years and it was much better than I remember. The manicotti was excellent, great salad, good bread, and great service. Good atmosphere. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the portions (although plenty) are not what you would get at most italian restaurants in this price range.

Office looks spotless, great pictures everywhere including on the ceiling when you are laying back in the chair! Everyone was soooo nice. Very attentive, always asking if I was okay, not pushy about "other" services like some offices. The dentist actually spent time talking to me and answering my questions. Genuinly nice staff. They actually make you excited to go back for your next cleaning!

The primary reason I decided to review the Bashas by my house is the pharmacy staff. While I always run in this location for stuff, I have never used the pharmacy until I just got new insurance and this was the only place in 20 miles I could go. I usually hate pharmacies. They are usually busy, have poor service, and take forever to get stuff done. This is not the case here. They were super friendly. Got my transfers done the same day! This is practically unheard of at other local pharmacies. They were amazing.   The bakery is always great here, they actually have awesome donuts (If you go after 8 pm they box them up at half price). They usually have enough registers open that the wait is reasonable. Produce is fresh, shelves well stocked, etc.   Glad to have such an awesome grocery store close to home!

This has been my primary care office for about 5 years now. They have an MD (Dr. Allen) and several physician assitants. I have over the years seen almost everyone in the office and have never had a complaint. There is almost always an appointment available quickly if you are willing to see anyone in an emergency. They always are very friendly and take more than 30 seconds with you. They listen and refer when necessary and have always interacted well with the insurance companies to get referals done.   The offices are always clean and bright. Great support staff as well.

I really love the Cheesecake Factory. I know the menu is huge but that means I never go to the same restaurant twice! My favorite is the grilled eggplant sandwich. The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is also always a perfect choice. As for dessert...the tiramisu is fabulous. The only reason they are not getting five stars from me is that at this location, I have had crappy service twice. Indifferent servers who really seem to think they have something better they could be doing. The food though, always great. This is probably my favorite chain restaurant. The ice green tea they added to the menu about a year ago is so refreshing on a hot summer day and the best part...free refills! Love the green tea.

This was really good! I have passed by here a 100 times and never been in. I was missing out! I love the cheesy decor that others have talked about in their reviews. I like it, gives it some charm and family feel for a chain. Almost feels like you are outdoors.   Lets start with the Sangria. Mmmmm. That was some good stuff! The chips come out with three differnt salsa's. I loved 2 of the 3 and there was nothing wrong with the 3rd, just not my cup of tea. I had a shredded beef burrito smothered in cheese with guacamole. It was really good. Very flavorful and I would get it again in a second. The rice and beans were very good as well but next time I want to try the potatoes with chili. I had a bite of someone elses plate and they were fantastic, I was very jealous!   Server was very friendly, fast, and kept our water filled and checked on us. Prices were reasonable and they have an email club that you get buy one get one free for your birthday. I will be back to try more menu items soon.

My sandwich was fresh and made right when I ordered it. The bread was really good, I mean I realize it was just sub bread but it was super fresh and yummy! A pleasant surprise!  People at work bring in the donuts all the time and they are always fantastic. The gentleman at the counter was friendly and helpful. I will be back!

If you want very specialized paper, this is the place. However, they look like they are about to close. The shelves are mostly bare and there are very few items. Also, nothing has a price tag on it. And when you ask someone, they tell you "it is somewhere around..." Seriously? They don't even know the price. It is kind of annoying especially when you have a budget in mind.   They also are not overly helpful or friendly. I really felt like I was inconveniencing them asking for help finding something or giving them my money to check out. Getting someone to come to the register takes a good several minutes. Guess they don't need my money. :( It is a shame because they really have some amazing things that I have not seen other places. If they would just give better customer service and put prices up it would be great.

This store has done a complete turnaround. It has taken a year but they finally have prices on almost everything!!!! Tons more stuff in the store and much better customer service. If you sign up you get a monthly coupon for 40% off one item each month so sign on up!

After being dissapointed twice I have to sadly write this review. The winter blend coffe was watered down and lacked any flavor this past winter when I went it. It was previously my favorite all time coffee and I look forward to the day it comes out. This past weekend, the cinnamon sugar bagel was so dark it was nearly impossible to chew and had almost no cinnamon or sugar. The quality control just doesn't seem to be happening at this location.

How did I not know about this great little theater! First, there is not a bad seat in the house. The seats surround the performance floor. Small snack bar with non alcoholic beverages and snacks. The producer comes out before the show to tell you about upcoming shows etc. I saw a production of Sunset Boulevard here on Friday night and it was fantastic. Very professional and what a great little venue to see it in! I was very impressed with the perfomers. Great voices, acting, and passion! They have upcoming showings of Legally Blond and Rocky Horror Picture Show. I will be back to see more shows soon. For the price I don't think you could find a better Friday night activity!

My family has been using Dr. Burke for our pets since I was to young to remember. He has a great personality, is very knowledgeable and is great with the pets! His prices are fair and you can usually get an appointment within a week or sooner for emergencies. The offices are always clean, bright and the front desk staff is very friendly. We have brought Dogs, Cats and Birds to Dr. Burke.

My entire family has been going to Dr. Burke for about 20 years. He used to have an office in the Superstition Springs area but we all followed him here when he moved. If you need a veteranarian, this is the place! The office is clean, pleasant, welcoming, and all the staff are always wonderful. Dr. Burke and the other vets in the office are all amazing with the animals. I have brought dogs and cats to him over the years but I also see people in the office with birds and reptiles. His prices are fair and there are usually appointments the same day if you are willing to take any of the providers. I wouldn't take my animals anywhere else and Dr. Burke can never retire!!!

This is for the Uhaul part of the store. I arrived on Saturday about 30 minutes early to pick up my Uhaul truck for a move. The guy said my truck wasn't there yet but I was early so I said I would wait. As soon as I sat down, I heard him call the previous person who had my soon to be truck and asked her when it would be back and reminded her that she was supposed to have turned it in already. The person apparently said she wasn't brigining it back any time soon.   Rather than me having to argue which you usually do when something doesn't go right, he fixed it. He told me I could have the larger truck for the same price plus discounted the gas/miles charges. No argument, no trying to worm his way out of it, just good customer service. He fixed it and made it worth my while for the inconvienience. I returned it to the drop box yesterday when they were closed and had an emailed invoice to me this morning bright and early.   Great customer service. They even called when they got my rental information when I booked it online and confirmed.

Someone should have told me about this happy hour! This really is the best value for happy hour that I have ever seen. You get food off their regular fantastic menu at a discounted price and they don't skimp and give you tiny portions like many places do for happy hour. I shared the "big ass burger"  and the green chili pork and they were both really good. The burger really is huge but really good and comes with fries. The green chili was good spicy and flavorful and I want to go back for more!   Drinks, they have about 5 signature drinks for happy hour that are $5 and a few wines as well. Great value. The guava mojito was amazing and I could have had several! The margarita was a dissappointment, too much sour mix. Stick with the mojitos! They are great. This really didn't feel like happy hour with the full meal we had at such a great price for such a nice restaurant. Service was good and not pushy or trying to rush you at all which is a nice change! I will be back very soon!

This seems to have become my families go to place for celebrations. Please make a reservation, this place is small and always busy. With a reservation we have never had difficulty getting right in.   This last visit, the baked stuffed shrimp was amazing. The portions are decent for a higher priced restaurant. The amaretto cheesecake...FANFREAKINGTASIC!!! They bring an actual shot of amaretto :)   Others in the party had stuffed fish, crab legs, and salmon. Everyone said their meal was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh. I like the atmosphere here. It may not be for everyone, a little small and closed in but you feel like you have left Arizona and are in a little restaurant on the east coast. It is reminiscent of my favorite place in Massachusetts.   I have always had quick, courteous service. Always several people refilling drinks, food is always quick and we never feel rushed.

Wow! I stocked up on peppers, flour to make pasta, wine, and ladyfingers for tiramisu and had an amazing lunch. We shared a meatball and a sausage sandwich and I can't decide which one I like better. And the price...So reasonable. Our bill for the 2 sandwiches and 2 drinks was just under $20. What a price! and we had more food than we could eat. The deli section looks amazing and I can't wait to get some meats for home from here soon. They have a fantastic selection of products. We had to go back and get cannoli's for later and we just had them tonight and they were some of the best I have had and the most reasonable. Another place has some very similar and charges double the price they charged. I am very impressed with this place and am just sad it took me so long to get here and try it. I already have stuff picked out to try on my next trip!

AMAZING! This was not something I was excited about doing and ended up loving it. I bought the extended 3 hour tour for my boyfriend for Christmas who loves Frank Lloyd Wright and so I thought we would go take the "behind the scenes" extended tour and it was worth every penny.The extended tour comes with tea in the dining room where we actually had a guest speaker who studied with the master himself. The stories were fabulous, the scenery and architecture truly beautiful and unique, and worth a stop even if you do one of the shorter tours.

I have been a regular at the Tempe Improv for years. Years and years. We go probably 5-6 times a year easy. I was so sad when they closed their doors. The first time we went since they reopened was a 4 star experience bordering on 5. I was very happy and so glad to have my Tempe Improv back. So off we went 3 weeks later with the whole family to see another show. Now when you plan a night out, and you have to arrange babysitters etc. You want a night out! My niece got the babysitter, we made a reservation way in advance and we arrive at the door.   But it is closed. We call wondering what we did wrong and they tell us that they are closed because of storm damage. It happens. This would be completly understandable and they would still have 4 stars. However, no one notified us. Any of us and we all get emails and text updates from them regularly. How hard would it have been to send a blanket email saying we apologize for the inconvienence but we have to cancel this weekends shows due to storm damage. Not only did we arrive to find this out, but the people on the phone were like oops. Not I am so sorry, we will have someone contact you to remedy this, nope. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Oops is not an acceptable answer.   This is not an acceptable level of service and so very dissappointing from a local treasure. Customer service is not that hard. A text, email, anything and I would not be writting this review. I would be writting a much different account. I am actually really sad. Oh well. Time to try one of the other local comedy clubs we now have. Gotta love competition, they now have my buisness.  They have contacted me this week to try to remedy this. I will be giving them another try and will write a review update when I go back.

I have been coming to Gammage for many years. They have a great season of musicals every year that are of the highest caliber. I have never been dissapointed with a show. Every Christmas there seems to be a holiday show and the past three have been great. Saw the Radio City Rockettes, White Christmas, and Donnie and Marie Osmand's Christmas show. The bathrooms however are horrible. They are in desperate need of a makeover.

This was one of the coolest things I have ever done in Vegas. I have been going to Vegas at least once a year since I was about 7 years old. So I remember many of these signs. It was so neat to see them all in one place and that this exists. The tour guide was great. She really knew her stuff and gave you a lot of information on all the signs. The tour takes about 1 hour and was really fascinating. She had great stories about the people behind the signs and I learned a lot! When you get sick o the food and smoke and slots, head down to the museum and get a little history!   They are restoring smaller signs and putting them back in the community for everyone to enjoy. I thought this was great. There are day and night tours but it was way cooler at night! There are restrooms and a small gift shop with some great books on Vegas. They have really old signs and newer signs like Treasure Island's old pirate sign. So even if you haven't been going to Vegas as long as I have, you will see some signs you might recognize.

We came on a Saturday at 10 for their all you can eat tappas brunch. Now all I can think about is going back! We had a reservation and were seated a few minutes after they opened. Our server was one of the best servers I have ever had somewhere. While we were looking at the brunch menu, she suggested she could just get us started by ordering a few items while we decided specific items we wanted. A few minutes later our came the items she selected and ever dish was better than the last. When we ordered more, she got thm out timely and even brought some on her own. When we said we were full, she told us to sit a few minutes so we could make room for more! We never felt rushed or like we ordered to much which is the case so many times when it is all you can eat.   All the food was amazing. The most memorable was the has with fried egg. The meat was so flavorful I could have eaten this alone and given the restaurant 5 stars. I also loved the shrimp and grits, french toast, and pork belly with waffle. They kept our drinks full and took away plates that were empty quickly. This will be a regular stop on every Vegas trip from now on. I can't wait to try "regular' menu items because if you can get that many dishes right, then the other stuff has to be good!

I thought I would update this review because after over two years, this is still one of my favorite restaurants. I have never had a bad or eh meal here and I have always had great service. My favorite is still the orange chicken. The crab wontons are still amazing. I also now have a few new favorite there. The sweet and sour chicken is actually pretty good and I am not usually a fan. The five vegetable fried rice could be a meal in itself! The berries flambe for dessert are really good. The duck is good but not fantastic like the other dishes. I also like the wonton soup. It always has enough pork and wontons in it and has a nice kick.   If you sign up for their newsletter, you do not get bombarded with emails but will get a coupon for your birthday and emails with announcements for holiday specials about 3 times a year. For the holidays they also offered a gift card special.

Build your own shake, need I say more! and build your own burger with more things to choose from than you can even imagine. Six types of "fries" the zucchini fries, sweet potato fries, and steak fries are all superb. You can even get a sampler of fries where you pick three. This place never lets you down. Hands down the best burger anywhere!

This is one of the top shows I have ever seen in Vegas. Tons of audience participation, lots of laughs, great political statements, and great illusions. I think it is really nice that one of them come out after the show and take pictures with the people who came to see them. I will be back to see them again, from what they said, it sounds like they rotate their show quite often and are always adding new things.

Stayed here on my most recent Vegas trip and was very happy with everything. This for the price was probably the best value I have seen in a long time. The rooms were well lit, had comfy beds, good strong showers, and non of that smoke smell that you often get in Vegas. The check in desk was fast and friendly. The hotel itself has a lot of restaurants and bars though we were out of the hotel much more than we were in it. They give guests discounts for the Secret Garden which was a nice bonus. We had a great view of the pools where we could watch the dolphins swimming in the mornings which is a fantastic way to wake up! The mini bar was the best stocked I have ever seen and the prices were not to out there! I would stay here again for sure. There was always plenty of parking as well.

This was a truly great meal. We started with the clams casino and they were very tasty. We then split the boneless ribeye which was for "2-3 people." This thing could easily feed 3-4! We sure did get our fill of steak! It was a fabulous steak though. Cooked perfectly and sliced table side. The service was impecable. The atmosphere is fun with all the caricatures everywhere. Very good wine list. This was not our first choice on a busy night when our other plans fell through but ended up being the best meal we had in Vegas. Now the prices are what you would expect from a place with aged steaks but it was worth it. Second best steak I have ever had. We also had a side of the cheese potatoes and they were so flavorful. I could have eaten them for a meal! The sides for 2 are very good portions for the price. You will not leave hungry!

I want to know how on earth they got four diamonds. The room had a bathroom with a glass door and you could hear everything going on in there :( Glad my boyfriend loves me! really uncomfortable, no fan to put on or anything. Customer service was lacking, they charge $18 a day in resort fees and the only thing I use is the printing of airline tickets and three people could not give us paper for the printer. The television in our room had a huge line through the picture, had we been on a relaxing vacation and not been on the go the whole time, I would have asked for a new room.   Can't believe the level of service and poor room quality is four diamonds. I have been at much nicer places with a lot less diamonds!

If breakfast was this good, I can't wait to try dinner! Lets start with the cappucino. The huge huge huge cappucino! It was perfect. Not burnt, served in a bowl, yes a bowl! and very tasty. One of the best I have had outside of Italy! Then the Croque Monsieurr. So delicious. The breakfast potatos were fantastic as well. Great service, amazing view of the strip. I am not really a breakfast person so for me to be impressed at breakfast is saying a lot! This was not a place that was really on my list of must tries and now it is. My next trip this will be a dinner reservation for sure!

This is the first time I was disappointed here. This used to be the absolute best for breakfast. The food this time was very bland, barely room temperature, and the stations were not very clean. The yogurt machine was not freezing properly. The eggs Benedict tasted odd, like cleaner. The breakfast potatoes were very dry and bland. It was super disappointing and I don't think we will be back. The server was very good and kept our drinks refilled. But food wise, nothing was good, just eh.

Wow, wow, and more wow. I have seen 4 Cirque shows now and this is my favorite of them. We were just left of center in about row 6 and had the most amazing view. Looks like most seats would offer a good view but why not splurge on the best in Vegas! The show is very expensive but I do feel it was worth it. Make sure you come early, there is a cute/funny pre show that you will want to see. There are some amazing dives and acrobats that made the whole audience gasp. Having been a gymnast, I am not easily impressed and I even was on the edge of my seat and in awe. Beautiful music, theme is odd and disturbing and funny all that the same time and it works!

This was a blast!!! Amazing four days of entertainment, quality starts, great really bad for you food, and lots and lots of fun. We did have reserved seats, which even the cheapest reserved seats I highly recommend. It is a completely different experience with the seats. There is tons of greasy fair style food but it was all really good quality. No disappointments. Get there early enough each day to avoid the crazy traffic.

Love this place and I am not a breakfast person. The french toast (they call it english toast with a french flair) is the best I have ever had. They are always really busy so expect a short wait. The atmosphere is fun and I have always had really good service. Unique items on the menu including an eggs benedict with crab meat and artichokes which was soooo good!

This is one of my favorite chain restaurants. It is always excellent. The sausage orzo soup is a great starter, lots of stuff in it. The Rigatoni D is one of the best pasta dishes outside italy! Great atmosphere, good drink selection. My mom had the chicken and spinach manicotti with red sauce instead of white and it was delicious as well.

Loved this hotel. Had the person checking us in not been sorta rude, it would be 5 stars. Room was big, clean, and loved the decor. The rates for new years were fair. It came with vouchers for money off in the restaurant every morning for breakfast which was nice and was enough for most of the meals there. With the "resort fee" that all the places charge now you did get soda and snacks and wifi and the breakfast voucher so I didn't feel completely ripped off! This is for sure a cool trendy odd hotel but I love the charm despite being older.

Nice restaurant with good food. I had the Jaeger Schnitzel which came with potatoes and a cabbage and sour cream type side that was my favorite part. The Schnitzel was tender and the sauce on it was very flavorful. The potatoes were ok, nothing fantastic but good. We were a large group so I understand slower service so that isn't my complaint, my reason for not 5 stars is the waiter gave us a hard time about ordering any drinks while we waited for a few more people. The first table designated to us was full and he said he didn't want to take drink orders till everyone was there. He ended up doing it but wasn't to happy about it. That is fine but not great customer service. I have only been to one other German restaurant and I liked their food just slightly better but this was very good and I would return with a smaller party!

Love the patio! You feel like you are in the middle of a patio in the Mediteranean! Started with happy hour bruchetta's. We got three different ones and they were only $3 each on happy hour. My favorite was the funghi but the fig and procutto and the corizo was really good as well. I got a flat bread that was again mushroom and cheese and arugala. It was good, but a little burnt. And not just "crispy." Actual black burnt edges which the server should have probably noticed and not brought out. I left all the crust but the rest was very flavorful. The server was very nice, didn't rush us and we sat in between appetizers and meals for a little while.   You should call ahead for a table in the evening, we had very limited choices since we didn't but it was nice and relaxing on the patio but not as comforable for a meal, better for drinks and apps. Great location, good food, and good service but it is the atmosphere that I really loved about this place!

We had so much fun here! The store is cool but the second floor tasting area is awesome! We got the sodas "around the world" and the floats, one of each, and shared and had fun! It was great to try all the different items and some were fantastic, some were odd, and some were really bad! The floats were my favorite though, cherry coke float, yum! We took our picture with the bear of course as well. This is a random, fun thing to do in Vegas that is outside the norm but worth doing once!

This was AWESOME! Had no clue WNBA was this amazing. Between the passionate loud fans, the great music to get you going and the skill of these ladies, it was a super fun night! I wasn't thrilled about going and now I want to go back! These women are very talented and it was a close edge of the seat game. Their fans are as fun to watch as the game, they are very passionate and into it. This is a great date night, family event, etc. Anyone would enjoy these games!!!

I have now been to 3 shows at the Hale Theater and love it! Huge fan! I am always blown away by the caliber of the performances. They do an amazing job with the space they have. My favorits so far really is the Christmas Carol. The singing and performaces were the best I have seen for this play and I have seen it 4 times and each time was at a much larger venue and this performance blew them all away. And the price...This is a bargain! Really resonably priced night out. They have a Yelp check in offer for a free beverage at the intermission. Love Yelp Check in offers! The drinks are reasonably priced even without the offere as well. Parking is a little rough but not horrible.   Already have my tickets for Footloose and 9 to 5. Support local theater! Go to Hale Center Theater! You won't be sorry!

My friend picked this place and I was excited to try it. Super cozy, great service, good selection of red wine's. We were able to still have a conversation even with the live music.  I had the Risotto which was cooked perfectly and very tasty. We shared a tiramisu which was good, not as good as mine! but really good. Server was friendly and helpful. Wine was reasonably priced for a glass. Music was good. There was a live singer around 8ish. The bill was not as much as I would have expected for a place like this. I got out for around $40 for a glass of higher priced red wine, risotto, dessert, and tip.   I think this would be a fantastic date restaurant...now just to find the date!

I go to two locations regularly and this location always has the friendliest people working, looks clean, and has a great variety of classes. It doesn't seem as closed in or dark as some of the other locations. No complaints :) The women at the front desk on the evenings I go always seems to be wiping down the doors, windows, desk etc. Which when you consider all the sweating on the machines it is nice to at least have the illusion that everything is being cleaned all the time!

I work in Florence so I know the selection around here is slim. However, this restaurant doesn't skimp on flavor, portions, or service like other local establishments. Prices are on par with other restaurants like this, although I do wish there were some lunch specials. Service was fast and friendly which is great when you are trying to have a quick lunch. I had the Gyro with fries and it was excellent. Plenty of meat which was very tender and great tasting tziki sauce. My boss had the chicken caesar which she really liked. They kept our drinks full and the place is cheerful and clean! This is now my favorite place in Florence!

When they have the "additional off" sale, this is as good of a bargain as you can get. The regular clearance is what you can get in the store so the 5 stars it for the special sales. The store is neat and well organized compared to other clearance centers I have been to.

I don't usually review stores like this, they are kinda all the same! But I had such amazing service here this weekend despite how busy it was that I couldn't resist. I went in because they had 40% of everything in the store including sale merchandise. I got skirts for under $20 a piece! While in the fitting room, the women working that area was amazing she was running around getting everyone different sizes/colors, etc. She was super helpful. Probably the best service I have ever had in a store. She was pleasant and very patient.

I am very picky about dry cleaners and am always trying new ones. Careful cleaners I keep going back to even thought it is about 20 minutes from my house. The owner actually works there at times and is very nice. The other staff are all very helpful and my clothes come back looking great. They are quick and reasonably priced. $2.75 for most clothes. The girl working there even showed me the difference between laundered and dry clean and showed me examples. Very nice staff, good service, clothes come back great!

I judge italian food by "Is it worth me making it myself because I can do it much better or is this good enough that I don't need to do the work."  I was raised making italian food and even make pasta from scratch on occasion. I tried Nick's because I got a groupon and I love trying new restaurants this way. About Nick's...I can't even make italian food this good!   Everything about the food here exceeded my expectations. The appetizer antipasto combo was an amazing combination of italian meets, cheese, and bruschetta. Each item was fresh and delicious. For the main courses we had the gnocci with meat sauce and baked zitti with sausage. Both were perfect. Great sauce, fresh homemade gnocci and pasta, fabulous!!! For dessert we brought home two cannoli's because we were stuffed. Well that night we got to relive the whole expereince! The canollis are fantastic. Fresh, tasty...I really can't say enough about how good the food was.   The atmosphere is great, restaurant is nice and clean, service great...I never have to cook again!!! This is absolutely my new favorite restaurant and probably the only italian restaurant I would recommend to people as being as good as mine! Conceited...I know :)

Took my mom here for dinner. She had the Thai Chicken Salad, and loved it. The ginger dressing was amazing. I had the Jambalaya, came with garlic bread. Very good, not too spicy and tons of shrimp and sausage. We shared a creme brulee for dessert, AMAZING! it was sooo good. The service was quick, friendly, and everything was great. I love the atmosphere at this restaurant. never had a bad meal or bad service here.

I have been here twice now and had two very different expereinces. For lunch I would give this 5 stars. The hot dogs are fantastic. Really good buns that are toasted and great selection of toppings. The fries are also very good. The bbq chicken pizza has so many great flavors on it. Really good.   Breakfast was a different story. My omlette tasted like someone dropped the salt shaker in it. It wasn't even edible. My mom got a waffle and it wasn't fully cooked. the middle was still gooey dough. Had I not had my sister insisting that the hot dogs were amazing we would not have gone back.   So for lunch I reccomend this place,  especially with the great weather and all the outdoor seating. Five stars for their non breakfast items!

Second time here and both times were excellent. Had the noodles with orange/honey chicken and it was sooooo good! They automatically brought extra sauce which I thought was a plus so that when you get halfway through the bowl you have more to put on. Didn't realize portions were so huge so I got to bring some home and reheated it for dinner and it was just as good. felt like I got a great value that way! I usually only drink regular ice tea but decided to try their mango iced tea and it was really good as well. When you look at their nutritional information, this is probably one of the lowest calorie etc. places you are going to find when eating out. I was impressed. Can't wait to go back!   If you sign up online for their email "club" you will get a $5 off coupon as well!

I like this place more and more everytime I go. They send lots of email coupons for buy one get one free meals which makes it even tastier! I am updating because I had the sweet potatoe fries! They were amazing and I love the dipping sauce they bring for them. I always feel like I get my money worth here because the portions are so huge that I get two meals out of the bowls. I get to enjoy the meal again the next day for lunch! I tried the fish recently as well. It was good. I was trying to eat healthier so I gave it a go. The seasoning was really good and they let me get the coconut flavored rice and beans with it which is always very tasty.

AMAZING! We tried this restaurant because of a Groupon and will keep coming back because of the amazing food. The chili relleno was the best I have ever had and I lived in New Mexico for a year and never found one that came close to this place! Warm monterey jack cheese oozed from my chili with shrip and just a light batter. The fundido dish was very good as well. Just a kick of jalapeno and lots of cream cheese.   The atmosphere was great. Service was fantastic. Several people checked on our table to make sure we were good. The complimentary chips and salsa were yummy, they don't just put regular chips, there were a different variety that were more like a crisp and they were yummy!   They also gave us a card for $5 off our next visit which will be soon! This was probably the best mexican food I have had ever!

I wanted to be able to give this place 5 stars. I love tea places. However, my thai boba tea just really didn't have much flavor. IMy dates tea was ok but they must have just brewed it and didn't tell us that and the ice was melted in minutes and it was luke warm rather than cold. The price was pretty steep also. I got some of the strawberry green tea to brew at home and was shocked when she told me my total. Overall I think there are places with better quality and pricing around the valley. The two iced teas came to $11 and it cost $28 for 4 ounces of loose leaf tea.

Been here a few times now and I love the couches and fire places at night. I think it is a fantastic area to be able to do so much at once. Shopping, eating, Dave and Busters, a theater with a cine capri, etc. After all that fun I love grabbing a coffee and sitting in front of the fires and relaxing. I am guessing the better the weather gets this place is going to be packed, all my visits have been this summer. I also saw a splash pad for the little ones to have fun in. The whole place looks well maintained and I will be back soon!

Now this is a sandwich! I had the steak cheesesteak with everything on it and added buffalo sauce and it was a gooey amazing mess~but iin a great way of course like it should be. Fries and sweet potato fries were both great with their special fry sauce. It was packed at lunch but they were fast getting everything out which was nice being in a crunch ourselves to get back to work. Outside seating was nice on a sunny 70 degree day. There are lots of menu choices so I will be back to perfect my cheesteak though it was pretty darn good the first time!

I have been here twice now and both times ahve been great. The sushi has been fresh and tasty! The service was great both time as well. The price is a little high but on par with some of the other sushi locations around the valley. I thought they had a great selection of sushi and sashimi. The vegas roll and phili roll are both fantastic. The first time I went the person I was with didn't know much about sushi and the server took the time to explain and recommend some of the rolls which was very nice.

Tammi, the owner, is amazing. She always does a great job. The place is always clean and she always has the latest products. I have been to other salons where they only have 7 to 10 gel polish, not Tammi, she has over 240 (we counted them! hehe). Had a great pedicure and gel manicure. I go every three weeks and she always has my appointment ready for me.

I am updating my review because I got my eyebrows waxed there for the first time and was very happy with the job that Tammi did. The renovations to the place are really nice as well. They made my favorite place to get my nails and toes done even better and now I can add eyebrows to the mix. They always do a fantastic job and I never have a complaint.

Some day I hope to be rich enough to only shop here! In the meantime I get to go in and dream of buying all my groceries at such a wonderful place and pick a few items that are within my sad budget! This store really is amazing. The selection of prepared foods, healthy/special diet items, etc is amazing.   This trip I bought the nan and heated it up for dinner and it was so soft, flavorful, and perfect. It was even better than the nan I had at the last indian restaurant I went to! I also got the pleasure of trying Sweet Republic's ice cream which had some really unique flavors. I loved the honey lavender and it was a great way to finish off shopping.   I was able to find produce that I haven't found in even other high end stores like Aj's. I wish I had one closer to me although I would probably be broke because I would never cook again, I would just go there every few days and try everything!

Consist, good service and food. I love the Georgia Chopped Pork plate. The portions are huge and I always get two meals out of it which is awesome for the money. I know it is childish but I love their jalepeno mac and cheese! I think it is my favorite part! My brother in law says the ribs are always great but I haven't tried them yet.   Love the variety of sauces. Something for everyone.

Don't put huge chunks of carrot in my sushi as filler! That was just the beginning. The sushi all tasted the same. One roll had the same taste as the next, mainly carrot and more carrot. While this would be a fantastic value, the sushi just wasn't fresh, flavorful or memorable at all. Service was ok. All the reviews say it comes with other stuff but ours just came with salad and soup, no appetizer or ice cream. The sake was good but not great, the other times I have had it, they were really smooth and good and this just wasn't. I am by no means an expert or know one sake from another but this was not like the other ones I have had. I wouldn't go back here on purpose. There is a lot better tasting stuff around. We tried about 5 different rolls and a couple sashimi and nothing stood out.

Loved hiking here. There is a neat little botanical area with signs for all the different plants at the bottom. There are several trails with varying levels and amazing views at the top. Be careful parking however, there are a lot of break ins when people leave stuff in view in their car. Easy to get to, right off of the US 60 as you come into Gold Canyon. It is very exposed so once it starts to warm up, be careful, there is no cover and no escaping the hot sun!

I love this place and am so happy I found it. The food was fresh and flavorful and probably the best mediterranean food I have had outside of Italy! Great atmosphere, tables just like I sat in in the trattorias in Italy. The owner was the nicest man, and actually talked to us throughout the meal and told us all kinds of interesting historical facts. My mom said it was the best gyro she has had and the sausage and peppers were as good as I make and maybe even better :) Can't wait till I am back in Phoenix next month to go again.

Two visits and I am a fan! I have had the fish tacos and the fish and chips. They were both excellent and I would have them again and again. Both visit I also got the New England Chowder and it was very good. Very thick and flavorfull. The service was excellent both times. What I really like is the atmoshphere, there is a huge fire pit in the middle which I bet is awesome in the winter. You feel like you are in a hut and there are lots of big fish everywhere! Kinda corny but in a fun feel like you are in a cheesy vacation restaurant way. And I mean this in a good way. I love fish and chips and this is right up there with the best in AZ. The other amazing part...the bread they bring to the table. It is more like dessert! It has a sugar coating and is very good. We even bought some to bring home.

I have been to a lot of shows in Vegas over the year. This was in the top 20% which makes it 5 stars easily in my book. I didn't think I would be a big fan of a ventriliquist but he was awesome! Funny, charming, the show moved along quickly, and there isn't a bad seat in the house. We received a 20% discount for staying at the Mirage so make sure you ask! When you get there, they have a DJ on the stage playing great tunes and he is a great dancer! Terry Fator had about 6 different pupets and each was funnier than the next. I really like the cougar and the pot dispencer ones. He was able to link the whole show together as well so it didn't seem like chopped up segments. I also think this is a show that really appeals to a very wide audience where some of the Vegas shows do not.

I was dragged kicking and screaming into this store. And then I spent $50 on stuff I had to have because I just couldn't imagine my life without it!!!   This store really is amazing. While the prices can be a little much, the sales are good and some of the stuff you just really didn't know you needed but will now make your life so much more wonderful. What made my life 100 times better you ask? Well...the ladies all know how fun curling irons are and how when you put them away you end up with melted plastic all over them. or that long trip to the airport where you have to hold it to put it in the suitcase at the last minute because it is to hot. Well... for the price of $17 my friend, you can have a container that you can put your hot curling iron in and never have to peel plastic off it again!   On a more serious note, the closet stuff looks amazing. The shoe racks are going to be a life saver and when I move next year I have a feeling I will be spending some serious dough in this store.

I really wanted to like this place. I love cajun food. I was so excited that I got takeout for dinner that night and something for lunch the next day. My optomism was punished. The shrimp etoufee was overcooked shrimp with brown gravy. No spices, no kick, and not etoufee. I was plain. So the next day, I had gumbo for lunch. I couldn't even eat it and had to trash it. Someone had to have dropped the salt shaker in it and decided eh, it will be fine. I have never had anything so salty in my life. The flavor also wasn't there. The huge pieces of sausage were very chewy and rubbery. I was very dissapointed in both meals and probably won't be back.

This just might be the best meal I have ever had. It is for sure hands down the best service I have ever had at a restaurant. From the minute we arrived, everyone was wonderful. Our server asked about our plans for the evening so our courses could be timed appropriately to be out on time for our show. We started with the octopus appetizer and it was perfect, not fried tasteless junk, grilled with some olive oil and amazing. I had the Oso bucco and it was the best one I have ever had. The boyfriend had their signature steak and it was cooked perfectly and tender and flavorful. We had panna cotta for dessert and it was also fantastic. Our drinks were kept full, our food was timed perfectly, our server was personable and friendly without being overbearing and the food was some of the best I have had. We will be making this our must stop at restaurant when in Vegas. It really was perfection!

Woke up on Saturday and decided I needed to try something new that I have never had before. So I turned to the fine Yelpers I have come to know and love and found Cornish Pasty with the highest reviews in Mesa. Off I went having no clue what I was in for and never having had "British" food.   I have now found my new favorite obsession!!! We ordered two Pasty to share... the italian and the spicy chicken asagio. Both were my favorite! They were stuffed with lots of ingredients and came with sauces and were very tasty. We also got the oven chips with garlic and jalapeno. I think these are the best "chips" I have had anywhere hands down. We wanted more but were stuffed! However, not too stuffed to go for dessert. We shared the banana/carmel/graham cracker crust/whip cream pie. And wanted to lick the plate clean and fought like 2 year olds over the last bite! While it was large enough for two people and probably three people, it was so good that I think next time we will start with dessert!  Love the atmosphere here as well. Really unique and we don't have much around Mesa that really transports you to another place. I can't wait to go back and have found my new obsession!

Mmmmmm. Fresh food, good service. The pita bread is the freshest, softest, yummiest ever! I have had hummus, gyros, "healthy" burgers, and fajita pitas here and every time the food is better than the last thing I tried. The potatoes that come with the burgers are great too!

I used to love Garcia's. Then after 2 really bad experiences (we are talking raw chicken bad), I didn't go for close to 3 years. Decided to go back about 4 months ago because I had a coupon and was hoping they had fixed the problems. Now after 3 visits, I can say they are back!!! I always get the Pollo Fundido. Chicken wrappted in jalapeno cream cheese and deep fried. YUM! I love their chips and salsa and bean dip that they serve. The service has been great each time since we started going back. There are usually $5 off coupons out there which is a great added bonus. They have great fajitas as well but I have a hard time straying from my pollo fundido! I am so happy they are back to really good food and service. Reasonable prices as well!

Had a gift card so we got items off the lobster fest menu. The service was great. The food was really good. Probably the best meal I have had at a red lobster. The cheesebread here is my favorite bread anywhere! The shrimp scampi are my favorite and were really flavorful. No complaints! I hadn't been to red lobster in probably over a year but this meal was really surprisingly good and I would go back now more regularly. They also put coupons regularly in the paper so we got $4 off our bill which always makes me happy :)

I was expecting for them to pressure me into getting a membership and was so pleasantly surprised that they didn't that I did get one! The only reason it is not five stars it the waiting area is too small, people kept walking in and realized there was no space and had to go back out. Defeated the purpose of "tranquility" space. The price can't be beat. The massage therapist listened and the front desk staff was very helpful. Can't wait for my next massage!!!

I have to start with the garlic nan. My favorite part of indian cuisine is the nan. We oredered 2 orders of garlic nan and it was burnt. Not just a little over cooked, the whole bottom of each piece was black charred burnt. Completly ruined the meal.  The Tiki Masala and Vindaloo were both good but for the price...I can get just as good and bigger portions just about everywhere else. The prices were really over the top. You pay for rice and nan as well regardless of what you order. I did not feel like I had a $50 meal by any means and that is what 2 dishes, one "small plate," nan, rice, and one drink cost us. We were both just full but had I been with a guy or my step father, we would have needed more food for 2.   The atmosphere is great, the place looks really clean. The nan was so bad though that it ruined the meal and even if it was perfect, I still would have only given it three stars because the prices are just way more than everywhere else. I had more reasonable meals at the best indian cuisine restaurants in San Francisco!  Our server was good, however, after our "small plate" she seemed a little put off that we wanted clean plates for our meals. She did bring them and was nice about it but we shouldn't have had to ask. With all the sauces on the meals, mixing them would not have been good and our plates were clearly very dirty after the appetizer.  Won't be back. Just not worth the price.

Great little wine bar. Huge selection of local wines. They are very helpful about their wines and will let you sample before you buy. Prices are great with glasses starting at $5 and up to the $11 range. Great atmosphere, quiet.

I really like this location! My food is always great. Service is good, usually very fast. I love their tomato soup. Really yummy. They also started offering a low fat soup that I can't wait to try. I love the paninis. And the italian sandwich... HUGE! and filled with yummy goodness. Pair that with the tomato soup and mmmmm. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   Salad: The santa fe salad is yum! The dressing is a little spicy. The kick is kind of a good surprise. They gladly add other toppings if you ask like tomato, onion, etc. I have had some locations get snooty about this but never this location.   I recently had breakfast here and the oatmeal was really good. Fresh fruit on top, really good.   Now about those cream cheese brownies! Wow! My favorite brownies ever. I will say the chocolate chip cookies are hit or miss. Some days they are fresh and gooey and some days hard and crunchy. You just never know! I am glad that they always let you substitute another kind of cookie with your meal.

I wanted so bad for this to be amazing. It was about 35 minutes before closing and we were taking our stuff to go. Despite this they were still annoyed we were there. The ice cream was beyond old and freezer burned. It wasn't even edible and the boys ended up trashing it. The cupcake had hard frosting that had to be old as well. The cake part of it was fine but the frosting was not. It was very expensive for us to not even want to eat it and we probably will not be back.

I have given Chipotle 3 chances now and I am done. The food has so much salt and that is all I can taste! I also have never had food over luke warm here. I really don't like it when my food isn't nice and hot. This place is just not for me sadly. The restaurants are always clean and the people are nice but I just can't get over the taste like someone dropped a salt shaker in my food!

Great little tiki bar! They have really great happy hour specials. Most the drinks were $5 and there was a large selection. Four or five apps on the happy hour as well. My favorite app was the ceviche. It was really good! Fresh, bold flavors, and plentiful. I also had he shrimp rolls and they were good. Tried one of someone elses pot stickers and some edamame. The splicy edamame was really good and unique. The pink bikini martini was my favorite drink. The watermellon flavor is subtle but refreshing.   They had old Elvis movies playing on the wall the evening I went which was a fun touch. I think the patio will be a great spot this fall. Clean bathrooms, friendly, fast servers, and great new happy hour spot on my list!!

The first time I went here years ago, I did not like it. I would not recommend their pasta dishes. However, the pizza's, salads, and sandwiches are all fantastic. The pozookies are one of the best desserts around! Service is always good, atmosphere is great! The Santa Fe salad and the Italian chopped salad are great choices and huge.

It has been 2 years since my initial review and I still faithfully visit here. My current favorites are the jalapeno burger (they fry the jalapenos and they are amazing), the 5 meat pizza, and the oreo pazookie. They also added some new pazookies to the menu and the white chocolate raspberry is amazing. The service is always fantastic, love the atmosphere, and they always have a new list of seasonal brews.  They just started a loyalty card and I am saving up for the free $25 gift card. It is easy to use and I can check my balance on line. I am halfway there!

This would be 5 stars if the women who I paid hadn't been so unprofessional and just plain snotty. The service guys were great, they helped me find what I needed, got my oil change done quickly, did a good job on the car wash and vacuum, and were very friendly. The person at the counter had to ask three different people what the yelp check in special was and no one knew about it. She finally got the manager after I asked, I think she was mad that i wouldn't just forget about it. Then she complained to me that the service guys were not supposed to give me the discount they did when I didn't even ask for one, they said it was a special they had going on. She actually asked me why I got special service, all I got was my tire rotation for $9.99 and my oil change for $19.99. Both specials were on one flier. But what is important is the quick and thorough service on my car, it was clean and quick.

Patios like this with the AZ weather are the best! We had a good size group and took up most the patio but the server was able to keep our drinks filled and food when we wanted it with no problems! They have a good wine selection, great appetizers, and great service. There was live music on Sunday evening. I am really glad to have found this spot that I didn't even know existed. The brucetta's were great, I had 3 of them! Someone in our group said the cheese dip was really good as well. 2 glasses of wine and 3 bruchetta's were a good deal at just over $20.

This is seriously the nicest fry's I have ever been to! My niece just moved out this way and I stopped on my way back into civilization. Clean, bright, and some really unique stuff. Great selection of fresh produce, meats etc. They also have lots of household items like kitchen gadgets, furniture, plants, wall art, etc. I found so many items that I loved and am glad this isn't closer to my house because I would spend way to much money here!!! Great store for grocery shopping.

I love this Rubios!!! The shrimp tacos, bean burrito enchilada style, fish tacos, and veggi burrito are AMAZING! I have never had bad food at this location and anytime I am in AZ, this is the one place I have to go. All of the different sauces on the items are great, all the food is really fresh, and the staff is always friendly. I love the four different kinds of salsa's they have at the salsa bar. For "fast" mexican food that is always good, this is my favorite and I would send anyone to this location.

Let me first say, I have never had anything here but wings and curly fries with cheese so I can't comment on anything else. The service is usually friendly, The fries and wings are the best bar food I have found. There is a large variety of sauces for the wings, and always lots of cheese on the fries! great bar food! the televisions always have the games on also which is a plus and you can always see several tv's from wherever you sit.

They seriously need a better marketing manager! It baffles me that they loose money every season. Hockey rocks! It is fast paced, exciting, and the fans are so fun to watch! While our team is not so hot, they are still our home team so you have to give them some love despite them being very dissapointing this season... ok every season! As with any professional sport, tickets are kind of expensive but this is one that is worth it. You won't be bored! Go see a hockey game so we can keep them in Arizona!

Great shop for tea lovers. The really nice guy working was very patient while we smelled about 10 different teas. He explained what was in each one and even started recommending some once he realized what we liked. They had some ice tea out to sample as well. Reasonably priced for loose tea, especially after the sticker shock I received a few weeks ago at another similar store. This will now be my go-to place for tea. We bought two different teas and I can't wait to make them!

I really wanted to like this place :( I have been twice now and always feel like I paid to much. We originally planned on dining in but the place was way to hot to stay. They really need to put on some airconditioning. The pizza was good but not great. A little soggy. The second time we got 2 sandwiches. They were huge but they were again eh. The italian sandwich was the best but it was only 3 stars. They don't even make a house italian dressing to put on it. They give you a packet of dressing that I could get at the grocery store. The sausage sandwich didn't have nearly enough peppers or sauce and was cold and I only live three minutes away.   Very dissapointed. There are not many choices in Gold Canyon and I realy wanted to have a great place to grab a pizza or sandwich. I had catered Rosati's at a Christmas party last year (from a Chandler area location?) and it was really good. Guess I will try another location at some point but the price is really high to give it any more chances than the 2 I did.

I am usually not a fan of chinese buffets but this one is very good. The food is always fresh and the place is always clean. Great selection of sushi, love the crab wontons, and they have this crab that is smothered in cheese, yummy! They also have a mongolian section, lots of desserts, good little salad bar, overall a really great buffet.

Came here before a Coyotes game. They got us seated really quickly despite how full it was. However, after 10 minutes of everyone just walking past us and never coming take any orders or say they would be by, we flagged someone down and she took care of us immediatly and was a great server. I would have overlooked it had the food been good but the food wasn't anything memorable. We had nachos which didn't have hardly anything on them. The jalapeno mac and cheese was decent but room temperature. The beers were really over priced, I guess because of the game, I don't think a restaurant should change their prices on game nights. The atmosphere is fun but I wouldn't be back on purpose with so many choices around the area.

I have been here twice now. Once for dinner and once for breakfast. Both were great. I had good service with both a small and large party. Drink refils were plentiful. The food was all tasty...Some of my favorites were the oysters at dinner, the gelato (and yes I had gelato for breakfast!) the breakfast asian food selection was good as well since I am not really that much of a breakfast person! All the stations all seem to be filled quickly when they are getting low and there is a good selection of main items, desserts, fruit, etc. Solid buffet with good staff working hard!

I stayed here on July 3rd for a night with a friend and loved it. We had an amazing view, the room was spacious, modern, and clean. The cigar/martini bar has an outside area that has couches and tables and was a great place to relax with a drink. They had a fun variety of specialty martinis and great service. While I am not a fan of buffets, it was very good. I can't complain! The food was hot, there was a good variety, and the server was attentive to clearing our plates and refilling our drinks. Room service was fast and the food was good. We had nachos and hummus for watching the fireworks and they were both huge portions and good. The price wasn't completely ridiculous either for room service.   Great casino with the exception of the smoking. Good food, great rooms, amazing views. I want to go back and try their cajun/new orleans style food restaurant. It was to busy the night we were there and we didn't have reservations but I will go there soon, the food looked amazing.

This is my new favorite restaurant. This is the perfect date restaurant and the perfect try something new restaurant. While the menu is small, the food is amazing. I have been three times now and tried several thing and they are all better than the previous! My favorite so far is the shrimp boil. The ettouffee is also very good, better than mine! Oysters and shrimp cocktail are also some of the best I have ever had. This is a very small restaurant but worth the wait. I like sitting at the oyster bar and watching them make all the dishes. The red beans and rice are just as good as I had in New Orleans! The only dish I haven't tried is the gumbo and that is up next on the list for me. They let you pick the spiciness of the dishes you order. I get a 4 which is a little hotter than tobasco sauce which is how they explain the levels to you. 3 is tobasco. Service is really good. Prices are very reasonable for seafood and the portions which are huge. I always have some to take home which I just make some rice and have a whole other meal!

Best BBQ place in AZ. Five different sauces all on the table, yummy chips to try them all, awesome fries, mashed potatoes, and pork bbq sandwiches. Great service, always coupons or specials, sign up for the email list and you get coupons. Reasonably priced.

I got in my head that I wanted something different so off to Yelp I went and looked for random types of food and found India Oven. Sounded really good so off we went! Now the food is solid 4 stars. So why 5 stars? The service is that good that it bumps it up. I am not a buffet person at all. I avoid them! But this food was hot and fresh and the buffet area was really clean. They bring fresh naan to the table, the good garlic one, as well as a chicken dish. They keep the drinks full and the dirty plates off your table quickly. They seem geniuinly happy that you are there and enjoying the food.   Now I am not an expert by any means on Indian food and don't try everything on the buffet but the Naan, masala and curry was all excellent. I also loved their chai and had several glasses which comes with the buffet. All the meats were tender and very flavorful and I cannot wait to go back! This is the best Indian food I have had in Arizona!

I should have tried the subs, according to the other reviews those are good. We got 4 pizzas and not one of them was even edible. They were tasteless and the toppings were blah. I would never get the pizza again. Had it not been the Tuesday night special where the 2nd pizza was 99 cents, I would have felt completely ripped off.

Fantastic event for a great cause. The registration process was efficient and easy. They got us right in to the event. Inside can only be described as a cupcake lovers paradise! They gave us each a bag with some goodies which was great to carry all the cards and brochures from the cupcake places. Tried more cupcakes than I care to admit! They had water stations, milk, and chocolate milk. There was even a bar area when you could purchase an adult beverage. Great raffle prizes, great merchandise for sale to remember the event by, and all the vendors were really nice and gladly explained what was in the cupcakes. (I have a peanut allergy and managed to make it through sampling without any close calls!) Can't wait for next years...any event that forces me to eat cupcakes and goes to a help a good cause... count me in!!!

My new favorite sandwich place! Great philly cheesesteak sandwiches. The italian is also really good. The large is more than enough for two people to split. They will add sweet or hot peppers and fried onions at no charge to the sandwiches. Clean, friendly and quick considering they don't premake the sandwiches. Good prices as well for how much you get. I will be back to try their meatball sandwich which is a true measure in my book of a sandwhich place! I will update my review then! Could possible be 5 stars!!!

For coffee and donuts I still think DD is the best. I guess when I was in my early 20's, the time I really started drinking coffee, I lived in Rhode Island and these were on every corner. You can't beat their boston cream donuts. Their original coffee is still the best hands down! I wish they had been more successful in getting espresso products so I didn't have to make my cappuccino at home! They do have a dunkachino which is a yummy mysterious coffee blend! I have no clue what is in it but it sure is good!

I wanted to try something new so I went on local dines and found a deal for Local Bistro. The good news is that I would have been happy here even without the deal but it is always nice to have one to try a new place! Amazing selection of wines. The drunken bread was my favorite part. It was very tasty and I will go back just to have it again! The pizza was good, a little on the salty side for my taste but decent. The manhattan clam chowda was really good as well. I really liked the environment and the patio looked really nice for this fall. Great service as well.

Meh is exactly right. While the sandwich was just okay...the wait time was unacceptable. Especially at lunch. They really need to have one more person working to get orders out under 30 minutes. There were three of us and only 2 other small groups in front of us and we waited over 30 for our three sandwiches. This was at 11:15 so not even the "full" lunch rush. I try to be patient with small local owened places but this was the second time this happened and so we just won't be able to go back for lunch. As for the fudge... sadly I can't try it because the guy behind the register couldn't answer what type of oil they put in it and I have some allergies.

I had a great experience here. For starters, they have some good drink specials each night. On Tuesday, they have $5 glasses of wine and $3 beers. We ordered a pizza and it was really good. Lots of toppings and cheese and sauce and cooked to perfection! For dessert we shared a canollo (yes the Italian in me wants to use the proper term! lol. One conollo, two canolli!) Ok, I digress! The server found out it was a birthday and wrote on the plate in chocolate Happy Birthday and took the dessert off the bill. Very nice. She checked on us several times and kept our drinks full. The owner or maybe manager came over and he was very nice. Very genuine and you could tell that he really cared about what people thought and wanted everyone to have a great experience. Where I would have probably given this place 4 stars, his presence and personality easily put it at 5 stars. Service was impecable. Pizza and dessert was really good, and they made a new customer out of me!

I have found that most of the gelato shoppes opening up around the valley aren't really gelato. This is the real thing! The only place I have had better gelato was in Amalfi, Italy! Great service, they are happy to let you try before you buy, really good portion sizes, and great selection. Beautiful displays. I also like that they have charts showing how much less calories/fat that gelato has then regular ice cream.

I was not impressed. First, they really need a better air filter system. I realize it is a casino and there will be smoke but all the others I have been to have a much better filtering system. Second, there was a concert there this past weekend and even though being free and having low expectations because it was free, I was not give accurate information. They said on the phone (since the website did not provide any guidance) that the seats were first come first serve for both shows. They left out the part where they were handing out wristbands 2 hours prior to each show and that they only had 50 for the first show and 16 for the second. And each person in line could take 2. We were there 2.5 hours early to get in line for a seat and were not able to get a wristband. Luckily, I ran into a coworker who got extra and they were there 3.5 hours early in line. This information should have been given out so people could plan accordingly. It wasn't like we showed up at the last minute and expected seats.   For the concert, the stage and area is really small, not what I expected but this isn't my complaint. When the show started, people were allowed to stand at the bar in front of the seats, blocking much of the view. So getting the seats were pointless since you couldn't see if you were behind the bar line. I realize they want to make money on the bar but allowing the people to stand up there and block the show to get the drinks was not ok. They should have a cocktail server during the show for the bar line.   We won't be back for another one of their shows. I would rather pay for my ticket and know I am going to have a seat and not be blocked. Not worth it even for free!

Finally tried this place for lunch the other day. This is my nephew and his girlfriends favorite spot so had to get a gift card and thought I would try lunch. I had the italian grinder and the boy that tagged along had the big rig-atoni. Can't decide which one I liked better, his or mine! I really like the spicy sauce on the rigatoni and my grinder was really good. We sat outside on the patio right by the fire which was really great and reminded me of why I love Arizona, after Thanksgiving and we have all these fantastic restaurants with patio's to enjoy! My grinder had cappicola ham which made me very happy! The waffle fries are good but not fantastic, a litle more batter than anything and way to crispy. For dessert we had to try the pizza cookie and it was warm, yummy, gooey goodness! We had the chocolate chip and it is huge, plenty for 2 with lots of ice cream. Service was great and we ended up getting their special buy $100 in gift cards and get $20 free since we will be back!

I do not like beer! But being the fantastic girlfriend I am, off I went to a beer tasting! Great little tasting room. We had a groupon so we got 2 flights of four beer each. They bring you a list that tells you all about each of the beers you are tasting. My favorite was the watermelon one. I really really did not like the IPA's!   They have great little paninis for $5 that come with chips and a pickle. They give you pretzels for the tasting as well. I do wish they were open later, I think this would be a great spot for a Friday night activity, maybe one or two weekend nights.   While I really don't know anything about beer, I know this is a fun experience and it helps support a local buisness! The prices are really reasonable for what you get and it is worth a try for the beer lovers out there!

This place could easily become 5 stars if they had consistent servers. The first time we went everything was fantastic. The green chili cheese bread is amazing. Nachos are huge portions. Great selection of draft and bottled beers, the list goes on forever! The server was amazing, fast, nice, answered all our questions, kept drinks refilled, etc. Second time, not so much. Our food (Couple of appetizers) were dropped off with no plates for us to eat off of, she literally asked if we wanted drink refills, they were both empty and we had just got our food. Had to ask for plate, we had wings and had to ask for more napkins. Hot wings and halfway through we asked for more drinks and she seemed very irritated with it. It just wasn't even remotely the same experience, she clearly didn't want to be there. Food both times was excellent.

Yum! After three visits I am a huge fan! The chili relleno torta is my favorite and the guacamole is really great as well. The burritos are huge and very good as well. I have had great service each time I have gone and love the patio and unique atmosphere. Some of the different margarita flavors sound odd and end up being really good so try them! There are some unique selections on the menu and I can't wait to try more of them but I can't seem to get past the chili relleno torta! The fries that come with it have chili powder seasoning on them which is different but I really liked it. Huge tequilla selection if you are interested in trying different ones. Our server was knowledgable about them which was nice. I will be back to try some tacos and happy hour!

This was a fun afternoon! I hate when festivals are really overcrowded but this wasn't. They sold an appropriate number of tickets. There were so many choices and all my new favorites were there. The people at all the booths were fast and friendly. The grounds were perfect for it but the parking was really far away but that is expected downtown. It was well marked and there were attendants to give directions and information. Learned about a ton of breweries I didn't even know existed right here in Arizona! Always like to support local and this festival really did. Great day and fun for anyone who likes craft beers!

I am not really a fan of breakfast places but this place was great. My omlette had tons of stuff in inside, the prices were reasonable (you can add bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc to any meal for $1 each). The menu is huge, the company I was with had a chicken salad sandwich, biscuits with gravy, and mushroom caps smothered with cheese. Everyone loved their meal and cleaned their plate.   The wait time was 10 minutes for a party of 5. They always seem busy on the weekends and close around 2 so get there early!

This experience is all over the place. I would probably give it 3 stars if my steak had not been the best I have ever had. The beef wellington that my boyfriend got was tasteless. The sales by the server are very high pressure to the point of being uncomfortable. $12 for water is extreme even at a high end steakhouse. The atmosphere is great, the steak I had was amazing. The brown sugar and butter toffee dessert is one of the best desserts I have ever had. The Welsh rarebit soup was also excellent. Just wish his signature dish had been better and the service more relaxed and enjoyable.

Fun time! Lines were a little long when we got there at 5 for wristbands/drinks etc but nothing crazy. The first three places we did pick to eat at were out of many items and the festival was supposed to go till 10 so that was a little dissapointing. Not horrible as we found some pretty darn good BBQ anyways and some  amazing green chili mac and cheese. We went to the concert at 8pm which was really fun. There were several people who had a little to much to drink but security was quick and impressive in managing it. I would go back again for a fun afternoon with good food and beer and music! Price was right. Tip though: Park further away and walk. The parking right at the place was a nightmare with people blocked in. There wasn't any real organization to it. It was so worth the "further" walk.

Never been and kept hearing about it! Culver's was right on the corner by my hotel so I thought I would give it a try. They were very nice and told me all about the menu when they found out I had never been. They also gave me a sample of the frozen custard. My favorite part was the frozen custard mixed with some oreos. I had a patty melt and some cheese curds. They were both good. The burger was very greasy but it was good. Just not healthy! I will be back to give them a try and have some more of the frozen custard for sure!

I meet a group here every other Sunday night and we love it so much we just keep coming back. The patio is really great with a big fire pit and live music. The music is stopping for the next month or so since it is soooo cold but should be back in the spring. Happy hour specials even on the weekend with discounted apps and drinks. They have a really great craft beer selection including nitro beers. The service for the large party is always great which is a bonus! They have trivia on Wednesday nights and I haven't been yet but will by trying it out in January.   My favorites so far here are the garlic fries, fried pickles, Murphys draft, and nachos. The risotto balls are also good and the fish tacos are good. I really haven't had anything bad! But the garlic fries I actually crave during the week! They are that good. They have 3 different varieties of seasoning for the fries as well but I can't get past trying the garlic ones! Great spot in Gilber and fun atmosphere.

Very sad to see inconsistent reviews. This food was the best "bar" food ever! The server was very helpful and attentive. We started with the loaded fries. They have wing sauce, ranch, bacon, and cheese on top of very flavorful fries. They were our favorite part and we couldn't stop eating them. The portion is huge and it is $2 off at happy hour so they were a steal! We got 20 wings and split if half chipotle and half parmesean. Our favorite was the parm and we fought over the last wing! The server also brought us two other sauces to try, her favorite, the sweet red chili which we are getting for sure next time, and the mango which was good but I don't think it would be on wings but that is just a personal preference, there was nothing wrong with the sauce.   The server kept our drinks filled without being asked which is nice when you are eating hot wings. Brought us plates for the bones and checked on us. Nice atmosphere. They had the games on and the patio looked nice for this cooler weather. Wish this was closer to home! But worth the trip to Surprise, AZ.

I can't believe I haven't written a review till now! I am in love. Oils and Olives is my favorite place for olive oil, spreads, honey, and vinegar. My favorite part is that I can sample everything before I buy. This is also my least favorite part because then I end up liking everything I tried and spending way to much! The staff here is always very helpful and I always find something new to try. Some of my favorites are the garlic olive oil, garlic Parmesan dip, Chili Lime oil, and asiago cheese spread. They also apparently have a couple restaurants that I am going to try soon. I signed up for their rewards program and they automatically give you $5 off your next visit so I am going to use it to try their restaurant in Queen Creek. This is one of those stores that once you start using their products, you can't imagine how you lived and cooked before without them!!

So nice to finally have a good restaurant in Gold Canyon. The broasted chicken was very good but could use some seasoning. It was very moist however and came with some good sides. Our server was fabulous! The table next to us couldn't say enough about how good the fish and chips were so I will have to try that next. Great little spot and they said they are expanding this fall. I know I will be a regular now!

Starbucks is hurting my wallet by being inside grocery stores and now Macy's!!! However, I can't complain because they are always around when I need my fix! My favorite lately is the skinny vanilla latte since I am watching the calories. My all time favorite is the white mocha. The prices are creaping towards the insane but for convenience and consistent quality it is worth it. I don't like their coffe, hence the 4 stars. Just their espress drinks and green tea lattes! Staff is always friendly and fast at this location. When they were packed a couple weeks ago they had someone come out and take orders in line while someone was ringing and they got a line of about 15 people out in minutes! Very impressive!

I had never been here and we decided to grab a bite before a movie. Great little place with good food and great service. I had a burger and fries and it was great. Cooked right, nice and hot, lots of toppings.   They had a great selection of drafts and other drinks. Good happy hour specials as well. Our server was very friendly and did a great job keeping our drinks full, getting our stuff out quickly and checking on us. I will be back to try more items and this will be a go to stop for before/after a movie. They have several TV's going where you can watch the games, etc. Open layout that makes it easy to see everything. I like all the round booths around the restaurant with the combination of high top tables.

I am in love! A place that has wing sauce, cheese dip, hot sauce, salsa, and much more all under one roof. AND I get to taste test all of them before I buy??? YES PLEASE!!! The manager was very helpful as well as I was looking for a specialty sauce that I have to ship from Rhode Island for my holiday cooking. He helped me find something in the hundreds of bottles that is very close and worth the money saved. They were running a special where you buy 5 and the 6th was free and they threw in a bottle of hot sauce for all orders over $50. 7 items for the price of 5!!! I love a deal! Great store. Amazing sauces, I think anyone would be able to find something here. The best part is you can try them before you buy which means I found so many I loved and bought.   They also had some great gag gift type ideas. For example, they have lollipops with a worm in them, box of crickets...etc. Can't wait to watch my brother in law eat the worm!!

We went for lunch Saturday afternoon and has a great meal. I was very happy with the selection of Ice Tea and got the blackberry green tea. It was very refreshing. For lunch I had the chicken sandwich with aioli, mozzarella and prosciutto. It was delicious. The mozzarella was amazing. I choose the sweet potato fries for my side and they were hands down the best sweet potato fries I have had anywhere! The server was fantastic. The manager came by to check on how everything was. Service was fast and food was really good. I was more impressed than I thought I would be! I am not much of a breakfast person and they had plenty of things on the menu to make me want to come back again and again for more!

So much fun and I found so many new places to shop that I didn't even know existed! My favorite is the tea shop on stetson and 5th. I bought tea that I can't wait to try. It was fun running all over old town Scottsdale taking crazy pics with my mom and Linda. We ended at Fifth and Wine who had some amazing apps for us to try. Great prizes for the winners...congrats! I can't wait to go back to lots of the shops and spend a lot more time shopping. So nice to learn about all these local places to support. Great job Lindsey and Local First!!!

Zoo LIghts gets better each year. This year they added more to the dancing lights that move to music. The ball in the middle of the pond and the trees surrounding the pond on each side dance now. This is a great event for families and dates. A nice cup of hot chocolate and a stroll to see all the lights is a great way to get into the holiday spirit. They have a talking giraffe as well for the kiddos. I do recommend going during the week if possible to avoid the crowds but they are open even on Christmas and New Years eve. It ends on January 6th so you still have time to get over there and extend your holidays!

So not good that this is less than 2 minutes from my house! Really great sandwiches at fair prices. My favorite is the italian. I liked the meatball but I make better! They are always really fast with getting the sandwiches out and the people at the registers are all really nice. I love their soda machine. I feel like a kid in a candy store trying to pick my drink with all the fun buttons and options! Only complaint is they are not out and about cleaning the tables quickly. Twice I have asked for something to wipe one down to get a seat. No biggie, they are busy and I usually take it home anyways. I did go 3 times before they told me about the punch card as well but I have one now and will use it.

This place was fantastic and horrible all at the same time! They really need some leadership at the restaurant and training in customer service. But my steak and eggs for the price were absolutely fabulous! And the server was very nice once he figured out our table was his section. The hostess also have no clue what they are doing and there were parties not seated and wait times miss quoted etc. Both my boyfriends meal and mine were really great however. We will be back with low expectations for the service and high expectations for the food! Hopefully it was just a really bad day!

I have never had Scandanavian food. I had no clue what to expect. But I joined some of my fellow yelpers for the international supper club and boy am I glad I did. The food was fantastic. 5 stars all the way. The reason I still gave it 4 stars is that they seem to be experiencing some small growing pains and service is a little slow but they were very friendly and accomodating. I am sure they will get this worked out and it will be a 5 star experience soon! I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.  I had the Jaeger Schnitzel..? I am probably really spelling that wrong but it was so yummy. The sides were all really good as well. I had the dill potato salad...So much flavor. Tomato basil, saurkraut, and cole slaw were all really good as well. Great compliments to the meal. Everything that the other party members had looked good too.

Fun, challenging, no long lines! Previous years I have heard a lot of people complain about the long lines for obstacles. That was not the case this year. We didn't have to wait for anything. The start times were spread out and there really were not that many people. It was a lot of fun and I would do it again. My boyfriend said previous years there were a lot more vendors and activities, there really wasn't much this year. Everything was easy though, packet pickup, food, etc were all easy and no lines. The shower area however, many of them were not working. About half were down and that made it difficult to get a spot to rinse off. They emailed us later in the week about pictures and there are some fun pictures which we could download with the price of admission which is nice, I hate when they charge extra after they already charged a lot for the race. Food was decent, not great but ok for race food. Beer was great of course :) Obstacles were varied and fun.

After the absolute worst day possible at work, being tired, hot, tired, and frustrated...Le Grande Orange and Lindsay saved the day! I still can't believe the amount and size of all the goodies! My favorite was the chocolate croissant. The red velvet cupcakes and english muffins were also amazing. So awesome that we bought some to english muffins to bring home. And the swag bag...OMG! Two $10 vouchers to buy more goodies and more sweets! They really spoiled us. I am very impressed at how well they treated us. How did I not know about this place! I will now be a regular! I can't wait to go have another chocolate croissant and try some of their food. I will think fondly of them in the morning when I have my muffin for breakfast and a cookie with lunch! It is like the party doesn't have to stop with all the goodies I have still to eat from the bag!

I have been taking lessons for Guitar here for a month now and have purchased a few items. I am very happy with the customer service and lessons. Everyone is very laid back but nice and helpful. They have lessons for guitar, keys, mandolin, drums, ukulele, etc. The prices are decent but I didn't look around much because this location/times available was very convenient. They send emails with specials frequently and they give you a 10% off when you sign up for classes for any supplies/instruments you may want to buy.

Shhhhh Stop telling people about this place so we can keep it a secret! This is a great little place with really resonable drinks. The owner was tending bar and was very nice. He gave me a taste of the wine I asked for before pouring the glass and the prices were very reasonable. They have a huge selection of wines and craft beers. I love the atmosphere as well. It is not like anything else around. Lots of fun bar games, good company, good bartender, great prices!

The other location is one of my favorite restaurants and this one is just as good. We had a very large party and the service was just as good as if we had only 2 people. They kept drinks full, food came out very quickly, and it was delicious as usual. I had a vegetarian spicy asiago pasty and loved it. Most of the people in the group hadn't been here before and they all loved it. Not one person didn't seem to like the food. I would never think of getting a salad here with the amazing pasty's but someone did and it actually looked great as well!

Great fun at a reasonable price! It is hard to find family fun things to do without breaking the bank. All four of us had a fantastic time. The batting cages are easy to use and have lots of different levels to select for speed and type of pitch. The person at the desk was very helpful and we had a great time. Everything was easy to use and I can't wait to go back!

Very very dissapointed. We had fajitas and a chili relleno. Both had no spices or flavor. Very blah. I don't even know what to say about it since it was so boring. Inside was nice and the server was very friendly and fast. The salsa is ok but nothing great either. The patio looks great for this wonderful weather but two items that should have had lots of flavor and are pretty easy to gget right just did not hit the spot.

YAY!!!! I am so excited that there is now a Pita Jungle this close to me. I should probably just leave them my credit card and pick up my dinner daily! The food and service was excellent for our first trip. The food was really hot and fresh. I had a steak pita which was amazing. I really like the green iced tea. I think it was strawberry kiwi and it was yummy! I really love pita jungle and am so glad to have one closer to me. Someone from work brought some of their food to a holiday party and the platters they did were great. All the food went before any other food! The hummus platter had 3 different kinds and each was better than the previous! So they also do great catering/takeout.

Pssst...This place is an amazing date night, reception, retirment party, etc. place. It is locate right on the lake and has a really nice patio with picnic tables on the grass and regular tables on the dock. Inside is spacious and open and has great views as well. Service was fantastic, our waters stayed filled, our drinks from the bar were quick and our food was well timed.   The imporant part, the food: YUM! We started with coconut shrip with mango habanero sauce. really good! Then the skilled queso con chorizo, another hit! Finally we shared the fish tacos. Again really good. Nothing dissapointed. For drinks, they have $10 speciatly cocktails. I started with a edelberry flower, spinach, lemon drop martini. It was soooooo good and refreshing. Great flavor combinations. They have a large selection of craft beers on tap as well, I noticed some Oskar Blue and I had an Oak Creek nut brown ale.    This really is a perfect spot for occasions as well as just wanting to enjoy a peacful, good meal with a beautiful view. So glad I found this place! It does sound like from some of the other reviews that they had a rough opening but they seem to have worked it all out. Service was fantastic, place looks beautiful and all the food was really good. The atmosphere makes food that is a solid 4 stars 5 stars easy.

Awesome fun night out. A group of 6 of us joined another small group of 4 and in we went not really knowing what to expect. It was hard!!! First they tell you the back story, doctor becomes zombie while working in a lab but before she transitions she locks herself in and leaves clues so that she could get out if cured.   They tell you the stats, only 34% of groups get out of the room in the hour. You go in and the zombie is on a chain and if she touches you you are out and can participate by talking but not moving around. Room is crowded with the number of people and she has a long chain that keeps getting longer every 5 minutes. We worked our butts off from the minute we got in to when we escaped and yes, we escaped with 15 minutes left. Lots of clues to put together to figure out the combinations. It is fun, challenging and something I highly recommend for a night out.   Wish the chain on the zombie stated a little shorter to give you a chance to get some going but guess that is what makes it so hard and why so few get out. They do take a picture at the end of your group with funny signs and it is a good time all around!

Had a really great expereince here and it would easily be 5 stars if the service for food wasn't so horrible! There were 12 of us and several in the group knew that it gets really busy so we arrived early on a Saturday morning and got 2 bays second floor next to eachother just like we wanted. The hostess showed us how to use the computer system and was very friendly. The golf part was a lot of fun and a great activity for a group.   Now lets get to the food. The food itself was very good. I had the breakfast/brunch pizza and it was awesome. Someone in the group had the loaded fries and they were really good as well. Got a couple drink, some burgers etc and all great food. Service however was not. Our food came before we ever got our drinks or silverware. We had to keep asking and eventually I got up and went in search of silverware myself. We didn't get checked on for a long time to see if we needed anything. It was rather unfortunate because it took away from what a great time we were having golfing and the food was decent so there would have been no complaints.   I do agree with many people that they really should have some kind of reservation system. but for a group of people looking for a different fun activity this was great. Ended up costing us each $13 ish for the golf and checks were around $20 for lunch. Not bad for something unique.

We had a blast! We jumped, we dove in the pits, we sunk some basketballs, and we fell off balancing obstacles! Amazing time, all of us loved it, and we were exhausted at the end! We did eat at Krazy Subs and it was very good. The place itself if clean, organized and 5 stars. The staff and price... 4 stars. I realize there is a lot to do and these places are expensive but for the four of us this was a very expensive activity but we will be back. The prices for birthday parties seem very reasonable especially after what it cost for 4, the prices for the groups are great!

I have been twice now and I am a fan! I have to say the chicken and waffles was actually my least favorite thing we tried. It was good but nothing great, the waffles were eh. What was amazing is their biscuits and gravy. It is huge and really good. Just needs to be served a little warmer, both times they were barely luke warm! The oreo pancakes are amazing and are dessert and breakfast all in one! Service was great both occasions despite the restaurant being full. So glad we have this new location close to us. We will be back!

Fun, entertaining, educational night. I love that this wasn't just a demonstration and that we got to play as well! The host was funny and did a great job teaching and keeping you involved. The drinks... well they were just downright amazing! I didn't really know if I liked gin or not and don't think I really have ever given it a shot but I did and boy was I pleasantly surprised. While I still don't think I could drink it straight, the drinks we mixed were each better than the last and made me a fan! I will be making the blueberry lemondade one all summer long! Gladly is a great spot and the finger foods were good and the drinks were downright amazing! Nice little goodie bag and I am very happy to have the recipe cards to duplicate the nights concoctions.

Wow! What an amazing historical interesting place to visit. Viewing the house itself if 5 stars easy. The only reason I gave it 4 is there is not much organization when it comes to touring. The two tour guides didn't know which one was supposed to take our tour and neither really wanted to with both suggesting the other gives better tours and should do it. Nice tactic but I didn't want to listen to it. The house itself if fascinating and the stories as well are great. I didn't know much about Frank Lloyd Wright but learned enough this trip to make me very interested in learning more and visiting more sights.   They are currently trying to get permits to get the home historical preservation status and build a gift shop/museum underground as well as an amphitheater to host musical events. I booked on the foundation website but some of the people in the group appear to have booked somewhere else.   Beautiful home, beautiful view, and well worth an hour of your time to go see.

New location, still great shows! The new location has a door outside but it isn't the main entrance it seems, go inside of the restaurant and it is on the right. Smaller than the last location but good location close to everything. Drinks were reasonable and we got some chips and salsa for the show. It was pretty full for a Thursday night and the comedian and owner did great sets. We will be back for sure! Glad they found a new spot and hopefully they will do well. Love that it is locally owned.

We had a great time at this festival and the after party. I won 2 VIP tickets and while it was amazing, I do not know that I would have paid $85 each for them. It seemed that the only difference was the VIP area which was nice but not worth the extra money. Everyone got 15ish tickets which was very good and we didn't even go through them all. There are a ton of vendors to visit and they all did a really good job telling you about their products and lot so a little giveaways. The VIP area had 2 food vendors and they were both very good and our favorite drink of the night was in this area. Do wish there was more seating in the VIP area it was full all the time, even early in the day. We got to sample many different things, lots of which we hadn't even heard of. It was a lot of fun and the weather/area for this was perfect. I would go back just probably with regular tickets since we didn't even use all of those!
