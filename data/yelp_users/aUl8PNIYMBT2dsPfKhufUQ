So its a good thing they have good service because the food is not so great. at 38 a pop i expected Cadillac food and instead got Saturn style. On a positive note the bar in there was good but not enough to raise the starts since we go there to eat.

This place is fantastic. Easy in and out. The shops were open and it was 1 in the morning. Security is quick and friendly. I will fly this place again.

So the prices were fair, the selections were thin. I am not totally sure who would actually get sports equipment on the strip. I was expecting more of the fashion stuff in there. But hey maybe you could get all dressed up and play a quick game of soccer in the middle of the street. Employees were pretty good full of smiles and help.

SooOO yeah not sure who works here, except the people behind the counter. The clothing was everywhere and no one seemed to care. I was still able to find something I liked and purchased. But Man bring your gear when you are up in here. I mean you are on your own in here dont expect to receive help. LOL survival shopping if you will.

Where else can you go to witness a  minute wedding. This place is on point and professional at the same time. The place was nice on the inside. you would have thought it was a normal chappelish place. The staff was good. There was a cab issue... the cabs dont like to swing by there but if you walk one street up  really like  ft walla.

Well here it goes. We were seated rather quickly as a party of six. Drinks were ordered but it took a while to get them. Interesting since there were only two cars in the parking lot and the floor staff out numbered the patrons. We ordered pretty quick. So let's start with the street tacos. They are just pot roast in a small corn tortilla with onions. We asked if they had pico the server said no. Next my dad's pulled pork sandwich . This was more dryer than a desert and needed sauce. Well it also needed to be not a solid piece of pork. This told me one thing ...my order needs to be something that they can't mess up. So I got a quesidilla with chicken. It was good. But not filling but safe. My niece wanted the pretzel sandwich with no spice mustard. It came out with spicy mustard. So we sent it back and she drank her soda while we ate. Speaking Of Soda , Out Drinks Sat empty For 25 minutes. Server only realized it and brought us drinks when the food came out.  Server was not familiar with the menu I listen to her at neighboring tables so it was not that she did not like us. That was just her in general. I say avoid this place unless the impossible zombie apocalypse happens and this is the last place for food. Two stars because reading other reviews shows they can get it right. Unfortunately just not when I was there.

The service was amazing. My drink was never empty. On top of that The waitress would bring me two drink cause she said she was going to take a break.  I lost a bit of money but felt good doing it then bad again after waking up the next morning.
