Fantastic. Loved every part of my meal, huge portions, great drinks, and fairly priced. Its become the new place I like to show friends that visit from out of town. The biggest turn off about this restaurant in the past is the huge line I always see when I drive by but I went on a Sunday morning and there wasn't even a wait. Just have to pick the right days I guess.

Came in looking for something quick but tasteful. Was on a quick lunch date with my girlfriend Jessica A. and Asian was what our taste buds wanted that day. She ordered the honey seared shrimp while I ordered the Pad Thai noodles. Her's was decent to say the least, when I tried it I expected something a little sweeter but her shrimp was rather on the tangy side.  Not sour, just "citrusy" My pad thai was almost on the sour/tangy side when I was expecting something a little spicier and a little sweeter as well. It wasn't bad but it's definitely not the greatest. I'd recommend Pei Wei to anyone that wants a quick taste of Asia but not a place where you go for the full out experience of Asian cuisine.

As promised here is my updated review of Thai House after trying both the Thai Tea and Fried Rice. Verdict is.. this place is legit. Walked in on a less crowded hour of the day didn't feel as cramped and the food came out fast. Ordered the Thai tea which I didn't like at first but it eventually grew on me and I'm even craving it as I'm writing this review. The fried rice was fantastic. Just the right amount of moisture to the rice, flavor, and tenderness of the beef. Made it very hard to put my spoon down after it was all said and done. Basically, come here if you crave fried rice and Thai tea.

Best boba I've had in Arizona hands down. You know of a better place? Let me know and I'll put it to the test. Honestly. It's that good. I've never had a problem with their boba being frozen or too hard. Their milk tea tastes legit! I haven't actually checked though to see if they actually use real tea with real condensed milk instead of that powdery stuff some places try to pull on you.. Their selection of finger foods is just enough to keep you going but not so much it takes away from it being a small tea house atmosphere. A honest good quick boba place that I make sure to hit whenever I'm in this part of town.

Food is whatevers, drinks the same. However, this DnB compared to the one in Tempe is much better if your'e really just interested in getting some game time in. The on at Tempe Marketplace is crazy busy, like 11 people waiting in line to play basketball crazy. When I go to an arcade and am already dropping 20+ bucks to play games I want that gaming experience to be nonstop. However, the drive is really far for someone that lives in Gilbert... so that's really the only reason why it gets a 4 star.

I've often heard of Jason's Deli but never really had the hankering to try until my friend France R. was actually in that side of town and was looking for some healthy food for our dinner. I don't think there could have been a better choice in the area. Just options for every type of taste bud! What surprised me the most was the variety of foods that  they offered. I came in thinking "typical sandwich place...OMG tomato soup!?" It's definitely a place that I can keep revisiting and not get bored of because they have so much to offer.

Honestly the quality of food is about a 3 star but because I support the mom and pop shops and used to go here almost every day during my breaks from the nearby community college it deserves a 4. I've met the owners a couple times and the atmosphere in the afternoon is pretty quiet sometimes which is very nice when you're trying to just have a nice break. There was nothing that I didn't like here and the pricing is good as well, its just you can tell the food was once frozen.

I luh dis place. I came here for the first time over Thanksgiving Break and it is probably my new go to sushi place when I'm visiting the Chandler/Gilbert area. Pricing? Great! Sushi? Great! The uniqueness of the belt sets it apart from other Sushi restaurants as well and I honestly feel like it is faster than ordering off a card. All in all I am extremely excited to visit again.

First off going into the restaurant its your typical hole in the wall small Pho shop. Greasy floors, funky lighting, and the TV on some random channel that no one but the owners are watching. It's to be expected and only adds to the experience.  Price of the bowls was cheaper than I expected so that makes up for the pricey sides. Now here is my biggest gripe with most pho restaurants in Arizona and for the price of the bowl you don't get the quantity that makes California a haven for pho. Especially since Arizona is competing with those half off pho specials in Garden Grove. However, I was pleasantly surprised when my Pho Xe Lua was actually a train. Most other places in Arizona I'm usually not full after one bowl but here I was starting struggle near the end. A bittersweet surprise at best.   With the exception of the meatballs, the rest of the pho bowl was bland. The broth was a little too "mn" as they say in the Vietnamese language. The beef was a little too rough for me and wasn't as flavorful and the rest of the bowl seemed out of balance too much tripe or too little meatballs, my OCD self had problems trying to get even proportions of meat throughout the meal.    Tl;dr  Quantity greater than Quality at Pho Nhat

This place is baller. Lots of really good Asian food for cheap. What more could you want? Make sure you get the pork fried rice when you get your combo, it makes it that much better. I've had Chinese food all over Arizona, especially in Tucson and this restaurant beats most placed I've been to in Tucson.

Perfect spot for a filling lunch. Its quick easy and not to mention the food is fantastic. I rarely meet people that dislike Chipotle and if I do I assume they're crazy. The service is fast and the workers are really friendly. Definitely one of my favorites for a lunch on a tight schedule.

Lol it's a theater. What's there to review? Just kidding, I've never had a negative experience at this theater and have been here many times with my cousins. Always a great atmosphere and not to mention the great shopping and eats that surround it. Probably one of the nicer Harkins in the city.

Just your average hole in the wall Chinese restaurant. I got the Mongolian Beef and all I can really say about it is that it is average. If you're in the area and craving Chinese food this is definitely a good fix but I wouldn't go here unless I was already nearby.

Great place for a quick lunch. Visited with Dan T. for a lunch break one day and it was amazing. My favorite dish was the side of sausages you can get with cheddar and jalapeno chunks in them. Highly recommended if your're in a BBQ mood for the day.

This is basically how my experience goes when I visit a Five Guys. *opens bag* "Want some burger with those fries?"  However I can't complain. Fries are bombastic and the burgers are amazing.

A little bit on the expensive side, the interior is gorgeous though and the atmosphere is great so the price is justified. The quality of the sushi was really good as well. Overall Osaka is a solid choice when looking for sushi on this side of town.
