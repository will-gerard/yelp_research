After passing by several times and hearing about the ice cream macrons I decided to go in today to try one with my daughter. Very nice, friendly service and the macarons were delicious!!! I will definitely be back to try their food and for more macaron ice cream sandwiches!

Came here and say in the drive thru for way too long, so drive up to the window thinking some would see us and help. Well someone saw us, but quickly walked away and never came up to the window. Needles to say, we drove off without food.

Came here and sat in the drive thru for way too long, so drive up to the window thinking some would see us and help. Well someone saw us, but quickly walked away and never came up to the window. Needles to say, we drove off without food. Good thing too, we found some great food at La Pasadita Hot Dogs!

Always fast friendly, service. I love the new sushi rolls, I've only tried the Wasabi Crunch Rolls because I love the "crunch" with the spicy tuna. The food always tastes fresh. Though the pork roll was flavorful, it was dropping in grease. I wouldn't recommend if that's the way they serve them all the time.

Food was fast, fresh, and delicious! We had the Estila Chihuahua x3 ($3.50 ea.) each, but just after two, I was already feeling full. I also ordered the small coctel de elote ($2.44 w/tax) We will definitely be back.

Friendly service, beautiful gift assortments for Valentines Day and any other occasion. The cinnamon popcorn is my favorite. Gave free samples today.

I've tried every salad, lemonade and smoothie! This place is my go to place for something healthy, fast, and delicious! My favorite salad so far was the seasonal blueberry and the cucumber mint lemonade is perfection! My favorite smoothies the chefs smoothie right now which is the tropical smoothie.
