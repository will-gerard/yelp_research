So I never would have found this place on my own considering that it is hidden between a huge lottery billboard and a car lot.  My step son attended this daycare after his mother found it.  I picked him up a few times and I have to tell you I'm not impressed.  The place smells, its dimly lit and its very very small inside.  There are 4 parking spots out front.. so good luck getting in.  The staff was not very friendly and the whole place has a very frumpy appearance to it.   Its pretty cheap daycare and I know a lot of the kids are on DES.  The thing that makes me give this institution one star is the fact that they were extremely unprofessional.  My husband is the biological father of his son with joint custody and the director of the daycare refused to let him into the daycare and actually refused to release records to him, even when she was shown the Arizona State Law requiring her to release the records to a custodial parent...she still would not release them.  After this happened I did some reasearch and after looking at the reviews this place got from the state licensing board I'm not surprised that they were so reluctant to give those records.    The things that this place was violated for are pretty pathetic.  One time they were cited because the only outside toys they had  were a piece of rope and a taped football.  I think you should do your own research in addition to heeding the advice of my review, I understand some people don't have a lot of options, but if you do I would reccomend finding a little better place for your kid.

Just signed up $1 and $20/month.  The place is clean and has easy to manage workout stations for those of us intimidated by weight lifting . Lots of cardio machine. The staff is friendly.  So far no complaints.

We went here on Christmas Day and it was wonderful. The staff is helpful and cheery and the butterflies were so beautiful to see up close.  My daughter is 7 and she did get slightly irked at the butterflies flying so close to her and even landing on her so I think a little prep for your kids is in order if they are  squeamish about bugs.  I loved this place and will definitely be visiting soon.

This business rejected my dog because he is well behaved on a leash.  They said he was anti social because he wasn't running to play with the other dogs but sat obediently by the employees side.  They would not take him off the leash to see his behavior  and simply told us they would not accept him.
