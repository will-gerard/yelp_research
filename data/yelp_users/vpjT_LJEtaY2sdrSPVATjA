This place is an overpriced attempt at Italian food. Poor service, stuck-up waiters, who never asked how the entrees were. Then the uppty waiter walked by and took my wifes' plate without asking if she was through.  That was our Valentines dinner. Then we talked to the manager, who stated that because of the recession they were understaffed and overworked. NOT OUR PROBLEM.  I will never go back.

Horrible! No shuttles running. No one at the gate to give directions. I missed my flight because of no service.

A great place for date night or any special occasion.  My wife and I, were celebrating our anniversary and our dinner was truly magical.  Started with the wedge salad.  Wife had the sea bass and I, the 12oz filet perfect temperature.  We shared the Brussels sprouts and asparagus fries, yes asparagus fries!  Get Them!  Finished the night with a butter cake dessert.
