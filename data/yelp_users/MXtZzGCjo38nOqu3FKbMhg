We've previously dined here before and had a great time but I guess they've gone downhill since then (or at least this location). There's no valet :( we waited a few min before we were sat at a booth, we let our server know we would need a steak to go and she advised us to order it after we get out meal.We started out with the carpaccio and pork belly, the carpaccio is still the best in town but the pork was dry and underwhelming at best. The salads followed we had the Caesar (great flavor) and Flemings (very bland). This is where the bad starts my husbands NY strip was cooked properly but mine and my friends were not I ordered med rare ( I received med well) my friend ordered med (got med rare) I sent mine back, the server was not happy with that. After 15 min I got my new steak done right, at this point the rest of the table were finished eating so we ordered dessert and reminded our server we wanted a meal to go and our check because we had to leave soon. She seemed very busy and I had to flag down another server to pay our bill, after 25-30 min we finally had our meal and could leave. Bottom line I think next time we want a good steak we'll go to the Scottsdale location or City Hall!

We have been coming here for 2 years now and we love it! It's so hard to find a good NY style Chinese place in AZ and this comes close. We always get the twice cooked pork, general tso, sweet and sour pork it's perfect every time. They have great lunch specials and their positions are very generous!

This review is strictly for the customer service and food we had for lunch, though after this experience not sure I'll come back for the shop. Me and a friend came for lunch on a Wednesday and ordered bruschetta and the Italian salad. After about 15 min we noticed that people that came in after us already had their food. At this time we noticed that a salad had been sitting in the window for a while. The girl that took our order was wondering around talking to her coworkers (they were very slow at this point) so we asked what's going on with our food. She told us it was coming after 32 min our order was ready! When we go pick it up she tried giving the salad that had been sitting out for nearly half an hr. we asked them to make it again. When she told the kitchen the girl making the salad asked rudely "why?!" She supposedly made a new one but I doubt that since it was completely soggy and overdressed. The salad was very simple and no flavor, canned garbanzo beans, iceberg lettuce a few tomatoes and too much dressing. We complained about how long everything took and was told that the "burned mozzarella" bruschetta takes 25 min. Really?!?! I've had plenty of bruschetta and know that even toasted mozzarella does not take 25 min!!!! They did issue is a refund but honestly between the poor customer service and ok food, I'd rather spend the time and money at Postinos. Don't waste your time here

I'm sorry I have no idea why they say they do Chinese food NY style! The food was bland at best. We ordered the sweet n sour pork and it was too sweet no sour. The orange beef was soggy, and finally the general Tso chicken had no spice or flavor to it. Please stop saying you're serving NY style Chinese food it's just embarrassing! Yes I'm from NY

Came here to meet a friend for lunch and I was very disappointed. We ordered biryani rice (not bad but not great either) coconut chicken, chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan. After waiting 20 min we got our food, the chicken dishes were lukewarm at best and there was no flavor difference between the 2 dishes. I had asked for my masala to be spicy but there was no spice whatsoever! The garlic naan had so much garlic on it that it was like biting straight into raw garlic!!!! We waited another 20 min to get our check since our server was nowhere to be found. I finally had to go to the bar to get the check. Do not come here if you want authentic Indian cuisine!!!!!

We came here with a group of our friends for Sunday brunch. Upon checking in with the hostess we were told the wait will be 25 min.  after 45 min we asked how much longer we had to wait. The hostess said "we are working on it!"I reminded her how long we have been waiting and she told me she's going to get a manager. The manager Omar told me he can have us seated at 2 separate tables but that we couldn't put them together (no given explanation as to why when I asked, he simply ignored us) that's when we decided to leave. I still couldn't figure out why we didn't get our table but as we were leaving I overheard the hostess talking. Omar the manager told them to not put tables together for large parties but to seat as many 2-4 tops as possible because they were easier and faster! The WORST customer service I've experienced in a restaurant and I've been in the industry of fine dining for 10 years. Get a new manager and retrain your staff never coming here again

I've been here twice, once a few weeks ago for a surprise brunch and yesterday for my friends birthday. The food is really amazing we ordered the bruschetta (the bacon jam and the salmon with salsa verde are full of flavor) pork belly, and the shrimp appetizers were tasty as well. For the main entrees we had the ahi, duck breast and the flatiron steak. Everything tastes so good, and cooking duck breast is very hard. So it was a pleasant surprise to have it done properly not too greasy or too dry and it had a good spice and flavor from the blackberry sauce. Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable, and guided us through the menu and the wine list. As for breakfast they have great fluffy pancakes that you must try! Also the egg in the hole with a fontina cheese sauce is perfect for brunch. Skip Postinos and give this place a try, the food is way better and they actually have a good wine selection!

Me and my husband have been here a few times and we had a really good experience. The menu is simple but the food is executed perfectly. The scallops dish is usually a daily special and is pure perfection. The shrimp and grits is a must try the cheddar jalape√±o grits are very creamy not grainy and shrimp is never over cooked. Shrimp po boy is perfectly seasoned and the portion is quite large. For appetizers you can't go wrong with the creamy burrata and pork belly that is crispy on the outside but juicy and full of flavor on the inside. We are definitely coming back here!

Me and my husband came here on a Monday night and couldn't believe the place was full. We had reservations but chose to sit outside, the waitress brought out a blanked for me just in case I got cold. Let me begin by letting you know they have a very nice selection of wines by the glass! We enjoyed our appetizer very much, we had the asparagus with the poached egg, candied bacon and it was amazing. My husband had the burrata salad that was very delicious. Main entrees didn't disappoint either, I had the duck breast with Moroccan spices chickpeas and eggplant and my husband had the pork chop with blue cheese and fig demi. The only complaint my husband had was that he wished there was more glaze :) We will definitely come back soon!

Came here with my husband on a whim and I'm so happy we did. I ordered the Toluca pizza and my husband had the steak and eggs. My pizza was out of this world I can't wait to go back and try another breakfast pizza! My husbands steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well the hash browns are also a must try. Can you please open up one on east valley because that would just be amazing!
