Great breakfast place! You can call ahead and have your food in no time. I use to live close by and would treat myself to this restaurant on the weekends! The staff is friendly and service is quick :)

I went here for a groupon and got suckered into upgrading services. I was not impressed with the services and should have just stuck with the regular car wash.

This place is great for large groups since they have an awesome happy hour!  I love the street tacos plate, chambord margarita and can't forget the cornbread YUM! A must go when I'm in town.

Yvonne's is walking distance from my office so my co workers and I use to frequent this place for a hearty lunch. The food is nothing special its plain diner food and well the service is very very slow. The waitresses would be a bit bipolar one day they are super nice and others they were rude it was a strange way to treat regulars. I stopped going here since it wasn't worth spending the money when there are better lunch spots in the same area.

This was my first time trying Bikram Yoga and I loved it! The website has tons of useful information that helped me before my first session. I decided on the First Timer 2 Week Unlimited deal they have on their site for $25. I made a commitment and went everyday for two weeks and I really saw results quickly. I highly recommend trying out the first timer deal to see if Bikram Yoga is for you.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Anytime I'm in AZ I must go to Oregano's!!! The food is delicious you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorites are the salads they are huge portions and super yummy! You must try the Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad! The pizza's take a long time but they are definitely worth the wait!

This place has delicious food! The wait can be long if you have a large group but it's worth it! It is expensive but I really enjoy the food so when I am in the mood to spoil myself I hit up Lucille's!

I use to work across the street from this place and would only go for convenience on super busy days that I needed a quick lunch. The reason is that the service is horrible and the food is alright but nothing special. I read the reviews and just laughed out loud because they are so true you really can't make this stuff up we had running stories at the office about who can top each crazy stories about this place. The strict restrictions are presented very abrasive and the funny part about that is when you are able to add on and pay for extras your order is missing what you asked for and you have to wait longer to get it right the second time or refunded. At some point I decided it was not worth the trouble no matter how close it was to the office I did not return.

I got a groupon for a haircut here and I was pleased with the service and my haircut so I returned the following week to color my hair. I wanted to try something new the hairstylist helped me with figuring out what color and look to go with. I was very pleased my hair turned out great and the color lasted a couple of months.

This is the best place on mill for happy hour! The service is hit or miss sometimes it is awesome but other times it can be slow and rude. It really doesn't keep me away since the drinks are great and it very spacious so you can enjoy with large groups. My friends and I have had tons of birthdays, happy hours and party events here just because of the location and prices!

I've heard good things about this place and decided to try it but in my opinion it was overpriced and the food was just okay. I had the Caipirinha Morango cocktail and I was very disappointed the drink was watered down and had one strawberry. My friend ordered the same drink and her's was filled with strawberries. I asked the waiter if I could have more he said yes but forgot and did not return. Overall I was not impressed with the food and service for the price and would not return.
