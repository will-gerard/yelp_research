Great lunch time with my buddy Michael , he had the Rustic and shrimp al forno,  delicious creamy on the bottom and crispy on the top , he had a Mint Mojito  and finally an apple crostata. I at the other hand had  Rigatoni"D supposed to be a top of the line and very famous,  it was a nice presentation,  fresh ingredients and very creamy, the chicken was tender, I had a glass of Prosecco "Rufino", I asked the 2 bartenders Arnold who works there for over 3 and half years , What can you tell me about this Prosecco?  He stopped and slowly mention it was good Italian sparkling wine good for apetizers and sweet then he turned around and left mmm. But I wanted to know more so I asked the other bartender Erick so he mentioned the same stuff Arnold but he didn't turn around to leave he saud Is there anything else I should know. I immediately answer yes , so I showed him on the bottle where the wine was from, what winery , who bought it , the type of grape and the process of making.  I have been in many up scale restaurant and I still have not got a clear and informative answer.  My guess is bartenders should know more about wine as well. There an urgency of mire wine education in Arizona. But I'm here to change that.

My friend and I came to Chpotle for dinner we start ordering but I noticed that the steak was not ready so when the worker "Justin " asked me what did I want I said a burrito with chicken and steak but because the steak was going to take a few mins to be ready he gave me a cup for me to get a drink while I wait at this time my friend already had her food and drink at a table so by the time the steak was done and it was a huge burrito Justin again has to help her co worker to heat up 2 tortillas to make the burrito roll now this was nice to my surprise the cashier Taylor told me I didn't has to pay that it was taking care because I had to wait for that long,I'm very happy for the caring and the 100 % customer service here I will come back again and tell everyone too Thank you Justin,Taylor and Chipotle you Rule.

This was my first time with my friends.  The waiter was OK. He introduced himself and asked us if it was our first time so I said yes and that it was my friend from Chile, South America.  The waiter did not explain, offer or promote anything.  So we ordered some California rolls and other foods, there was 4 of us. The food was excellent,  we had sushi before from a scale of 1 to 10 I will give it an 8. Suddenly I saw this very nice looking lady carrying couples of plates so she stopped and came over with a radiant smile and explained the dishes and introduced her self. It was very pleasant and great she said her name is Sarah and came back to ask us if we need anything and I ask a few questions about the menu and drinks. Due to her awesome personality and warm smile we all felt like we were at home. Sarah mentioned her passion for foods and the interaction with people,  she loves to meet others and make them feel at home. I WILL BE BACK JUST BECAUSE SARAH MADE OUR NIGHT MORE MEMORABLE. The manager was an awesome person as well. Thank you Sarah for being a real person and make our night something to remember.  I will refer Sushi Roku to all my friends.   Lewis

Its my second time here and right from the start we got told by the hostess that we could not sitio at the second level, its a beautiful sunny day on a Sunday afternoon and the spot to be its up in the second floor with the view of scottsdales oldtown streets and view of the mountains, so we decided to go upstairs anyways and met Austin the bartender and took care of us.

This is the second time coming to Genghis Grill and to tell you the true I was a little skeptical in going in again because the service the first time at the Tempe Market where waitresses and waiters were very indiferent to even check periodically or ask if we needed. Anything else also it took a while to get. A re fill on a glass of my iced tea which I set in purppose at the edge of the table empty while staff kept going by acting like it they were very busy also we waited a long time to get our check, the food was good overall My experience at the Frank Lloyd Wright location was very much rewarding and pleasant the staff was very joyfull and attentive to detail,from the moment we enter the door we were welcome and seated promply by the host and told that Tony will be our waiter which he did an amazing job starting by introducing himself and accomodating us with anything we needed our glasses of iced tea were NEVER empty and check on us in a timely matter I end up taking food home and a container for my iced tea provided by Tony over all service was EXCELLENT Tony you are awesome we will be back again for sure.

Everything about Cool Gelato Italiano screams ITALY! Alberto and Letizia are very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about their Gelato and anything related to Italian cuisine. This is The only place you can get an AWESOME and creamy "Fior di latte". The Pistachio is creamy , nutty and silky. Pistachio is one of the Most difficult Gelatos to make and here is made to perfection with supreme ingredients from Sicily. Cool Gelato Italiano have flavors that are in season so everything is fresh and delicious. They also make Espresso, Cappuccino, and Macchiato. I will strongly recommend to try and bring you whole family or date. They have a clean and chic look where you can sit down and enjoy your Gelato. My favorite flavors are Stracciatella, Fior di latte and Pistachio.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_GbCvta6As
