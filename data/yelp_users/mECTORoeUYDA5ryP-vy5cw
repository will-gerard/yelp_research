This is the worst Chipotle location I've ever been to. They don't hold up to the standards set by Chipotle at all.    -People here move at a snail's pace. Im not saying they need to rush, but the way everything is set up should make for a smooth and quick experience.  - If you tell them what you want they can only remember one thing you said. Example: "Pico and hot salsa." Then they just put Pico on and look at you. "Sour cream, cheese, and lettuce." Puts spur cream on and just looks at you.   - Ordered tacos to go, when I get home with them, 5 minutes later, I have a pile of sour cream all over my "tacos" which now resemble a casserole of some sort. I can't even figure out where one taco begins or ends. So appetizing for $8.   If I wanted crap I would go to Taco Bell. At least there a taco still looks like a taco and they keep the contents inside the tortilla.

I can't figure this place out. It's one of those places that seems like it has to be good from the, uh, uppity nature of the people who've mentioned it. (Uppity: more money than I have) So since I'm obsessed with trying to look cool and like I have more money than I have, (what kind of hipster would I be if I didn't?) I figured I needed to try it out. So what better night than when I am too tired to cook anything, too lazy to go too far, but trying not to eat my stress in Arby's 5 for $5? I read the reviews and the grab and go aspect sounded like just what I wanted.   Here's how it went down, straight first impression style. Parking- uh nope. No parking, went down the street looking, then realized, I just wanted to grab something and go home, no way am I parking and walking in this situation. Went back and snagged a spot in front of the paper store, which was closed, therefore I say it's up for grabs (plus upscale paper stores are bullshit). Go inside La Grande Orange grocery and whoa, that's a lot of stuff, piled to the ceiling, everywhere. In my head "grocery" means some aisles and a display here and there, not pyramids of god knows what. I'm afraid to walk around for fear my big ass will knock something over that costs more than my hourly rate. Ok, grab and go spotted, yay! Oh it's kind of empty, ok it's 8 pm, whatevs. Selected spicy chickpea lettuce wraps, and looked around trying to figure out where to pay, there's like 3 different counters. Ok I've figured out where to pay, but what is there to drink? Iced tea or lemonade apparently at this counter. Side note: I did not see an easily accessible path to this drink case they motioned to, so maybe I look next time. Pay, go home, enjoy.   Here's where I am most lost: order food to be made at a counter but coffee is at a separate counter? Like I can't buy food and coffee at the same time? Wth... Maybe I'm overthinking it, but, that's just it, If I wanted to think about food I would have made it myself. Will probably try again for breakfast one day when I'm feeling like a fight to the death.   P.S. Not sure where the hipster vibe is coming from with some people, to me this was all uppity white folk, complete with heads so far up asses that "excuse me" is lost on them.

Always packed on wing night, which can sometimes make for slow service, but that is to be expected. I love their wings, even if they are kind of small, but who can complain for $0.39? Pizza is good too. And the pizza cookie dessert, omg, druelz.

I love, love this place. I love their sushi, not as good as Ninja sushi, but good for the price. I prefer to come during happy hour to save some money. Sometimes you get a dingy waitress, sometimes you don't; just like with any trendy spot. Try the fishbowl drink with a friend at least once.

I have never had a bad experience here, and every single thing on their menu that I have had has been great. Salmon BLT, Spinach salad, Popper burger, Reuben, wings, nachos, artichoke dip, literally everything is so good. And lest I forget the beer. The beer is so damn good. I have tried all the beers, and I love them all. I live down the street and if I ever move from the area, not being able to walk there would make me sad.

I've almost always had good service at Pep Boys. I came to get a tire fixed and they got it done relatively fast. No charge. Friendly service. Couldn't ask for much more.

What the hell? I just stood in line for 15 minutes for the value food items, got 2 hot dogs & a popcorn. $1.50 each. This adds up to $4.50. Somehow I got charged $7.50. I had started eating my popcorn while I was waiting for the girl to fetch my hot dogs and I thought maybe she had given me the larger size. But the person behind me got the same size. So wtf?? Anyway, I wasn't given a receipt so I didn't have any way of knowing what I was charged for. I was tired of waiting and wanted to go watch the game. Except even now I'm writing a review instead of watching the diamondbacks get their ass beat. Whatever. Too late. I'm just pissed. Screw you Chase Field.

On more than one occasion I have had to point out that something I was purchasing was on sale. I have also picked up Mountain Dew that was a month expired and yesterday a Fat Tire beer that was expired. If it wasn't a two minute walk from my apartment I would avoid it.

I've been here for the live cooking and loved it. I went last night to use my birthday certificate and found them to be really crowded, with a wait for everywhere. I was bummed, but I had to use my certificate that day. I got put on the list, but the hostess didn't ask which list I wanted to be on (chef's table or regular) and I assumed that meant I would get the first available. However, we went to check and she said that there was a wait for the regular dining and would I like to be on that list too. Well, yeah. I didn't come here to sit. I asked about the lounge area. It had a wait too. Basically you can go get a drink and take it back to the waiting area. Ugh, ok. Thankfully when we got seated, the server was really cool. I forgot his name, they don't seem to have name tags. He was great, the food was good, so the experience was saved. Just dealing with that hostess who didn't want to willingly provide information was a pain. I've seen perkier people working at Denny's. A place of that caliber should make better sure that people who are paid to make you feel welcome in that establishment at least smile.

This Nissan really sucked when compared the Pinnacle Nissan in North Scottsdale where I bought my car. I came in for a battery one afternoon, which shouldn't be complicated. I pulled up to the service center and literally waited at least 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge me. There was 1 car in front of me that was being helped already. I waited, and waited, my car was running because if I turned it off I wouldn't be able to start it again without a jump. It's not like it was busy. It wasn't until another car pulled up and waited along with me that someone finally came out to help. The guy was perfectly nice and polite. He offered a free car wash with the service, which I accepted. It took longer than I had expected to get a new battery, but since it was free and covered under warranty, I didn't complain. Then when it came time to get my car, the service rep said they would come up with my car. I waited on the curb for it, and waited, and waited, and watched my car sit on the other side of the service area, for another 10 minutes. The guy who brings the cars around finally dropped off a car and asked me which one was mine, he went to get it, said something about the car wash, which should have already been done. I then waited, and waited, and waited for my car to come around after he got in it. I've never had to wait so long at Pinnacle! They get two stars because of the car wash, but I would avoid this Nissan dealer.

I've been here to ship things for work, and to ship things for my own online business. No matter what you're shipping they are so nice and so helpful. Plus I've never had to wait in line like at the post office or FedEx.

Stopped by to check out the new place opening at Tempe Marketplace since all the ads made it sound legit.   Decor: tacky. Like it wants to be Old Town, but comforting at the same time. Guess what, Tempe Marketplace is not the place for that.  It appears that they have decent specials. We asked the waitress if there were any specials right now (as in, like now, while we are here). She said yes but not right now, and then told us all the specials that are listed in the menu. Yes, I can read, I just read them.   Menu: there are no drink prices. Except wine. No prices on beer or the fancy cocktails it boasts.  Being adventurous, I ordered a honeydew martini blindly. Knowing it would be steep but not knowing how much of a dent this tasty treat would make. I figured if there are no specials and no prices, everything will be highway robbery, so I'll just get something yummy.  Boyfriend orders Budweiser. She asks what size, 14 or 20 oz. He asks which is better for the money. Most bar staff will tell you what is a better deal (as in a 20 oz is $1 more, making it a better deal). She explains that a 14 is smaller than a 20. Yes, we know how to do math as well.  $10 for the martini. $4 for the 14 oz Bud Light. What kind if bar doesn't even give you a whole pint of beer?   I would be willing to come back and try the $5 burger night. But for first impressions, this joint sucks. Sorry I'm not made of money, Bar Louie, I do live a mile from the university after all. I would rather head to Four Peaks where I can get a pitcher of beer for what we paid for 2 drinks.  The extra star is because the drink is good, but strong enough,

I've been here twice, first time I got a juice and second time I got a smoothie. Both were very good. I haven't tried the food yet, but it looks delicious. I like this place but there's just this vibe here- it's kind of like rich people who don't care? I've only been here when it's dead, so maybe they're more lively when it's busy. All I'm saying is, I got more conversation from the TSA agent while she was patting me down. A friendly greeting goes a LONG, long way with me.
