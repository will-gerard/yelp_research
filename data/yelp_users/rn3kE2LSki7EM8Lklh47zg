I love IHop! Food is always fresh and made to order. Prices are also just right. My favorite is the quick 2 egg breakfast. Staff is very friendly and quick service.

My first experience with India food was not very pleasant. I went to a buffet and the food was just horrible. After that, I tried a couple of other places and just couldn't become to like Indian food. Well, I must say that Star of India really changed my perception of what Indian food should taste like. OMG....they make the best Chicken Tikki Marsala, I always get it spicy by the way. Very good garlic naan and love their vegetables ( potato and cauliflower ). Staff is super friendly and very welcoming whenever I step in the restaurant. I usually get take out and they give me something free to try. Absolutely love this place!

Red chille Carne is the best. Every Wednesday they have special priced menu where meals are 7.95 and kids eat for 1.50. Such a great deal and it is very filling. The food is always fresh and hot when they sever you. Bean dip and salsa with chips when u first arrive, um I'm good. Definitely recommend this place for any occasion.

I love Einstein's! Always fresh and always fast. I usually have a cinnamon raisin bagel and strawberry banana smoothie. Kids order the cinnamon sugar with a strawberry banana smoothie. Husband loves their Sante Fe Turkey breakfast sandwich. This location is usually pretty busy but the seem to be quick with the orders.

This place place blows Starbucks out the water. Atmosphere, staff and coffee are the best. They ever serve cheesecake and baklava.   If you really want to relax they have an outside patio next to a lake. It gets pretty crowded so get their early....and yes free wifi. RUSH TO COFFEE RUSH!

Justina is such a good friend. She always makes me laugh and makes good conversation. The place can get really crowded for lunch but the service is quick. I have never been for dinner.  The chicken wings, spicy ribs, and pho are super good.

This place was introduced to me by a former co worker and I have been coming ever since. They get me in and out and are pretty consistent with their quality of work. They are super friendly and are always welcoming when someone walks in the door.   My nails are done by Andy. He is the best nail technician there in my opinion. My toes are always done by Hanna. They can usually get me in for late appointments and are very accommodating to get both done at the same time.

Casey Grant is my service advisor. He is great. I bring my car in for service and they are always fast and friendly with their service. I'm in and out with no problems. They have a courtesy shuttle if you need a ride back to home of work and free donuts in the morning. I've dealt with other car dealership service departments and this one is definitely at the top.

Why is it so hard to get good service?! I am extremely disappointed with the service I received from this place. I have been to this particular location several times and come here instead of the one on Southern because of the atmosphere overall but today was another story.  We made a reservation for our party of 6 and when we arrived we got seated right away, this was a plus. We got our drinks and appetizers ordered and everything seemed to be going well. Our waitress brought out appetizer plates and as they were being passed around the table we noticed there was still quite a bit of food on the plates. You know when you heat something up and cheese gets stuck to the plate and won't come off unless you scrub it, yes that kind of stuck. This leads me to believe that they don't scrub the plates that they use, gross. We showed the waitress and she said she would get us new plates when the appetizers came out. About 5 minutes later our appetizers came out but our waitress was no were to be found with the plates. We finally asked someone else for plates and they brought us great big dinner plates. Overall appetizers were excellent. We ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms and the seasoned bucket of shrimp, beware seasoned shrimp is super spicy.   It took another 10-15 minutes for our food. I had the Redfish and lobster which was really good. It has a little bit of kick to it on the spice but the sauce they use it prepare over the fish is phenomenal. Another person in my party ordered BBQ snow crab and the bucket they gave him only had 1 claw instead of the normal 2-3 that the usually give. Surprisingly the manager noticed this when they brought the food and asked us if it had come out like that. When we told him yes, he said he would send more food out and we could continue to eat what we had already been given. Some random brought the missing food out which I personally thought should have been a manger. He never came back out to check to see if the order was corrected or to make sure everything was right. Another person in my party also ordered the BBQ snow crab but when he got his food it wasn't BBQ flavor it was something different. When I told the waitress she went back and checked the ticket and figured out that she entered it incorrectly. She apologized and asked if there was something else we wanted. At this point i just wanted to leave. A manager never came over and this was the 3rd mistake they made for our table. It was almost time to leave and we got a drink refill it was supposed to be a Diet Coke and she brought a regular Coke. Mistake #4 and still no manager.    Food was good but service was horrible. Unfortunately, your good food does not take precedence over good service. I can go somewhere else and get both. I work too hard for my money and I'm not going to give it to someone who isn't going to work hard to get me to come back.

It's disappointing when you mess up barbecue. I really look forward to the fall off the bone tenderness of some good smoked ribs. This used to be my go to spot for several reasons but I'm crossing this off my list. The ribs here have gotten really bad. I ordered the big slab with an extra side of ribs and the ribs were super fatty and the quality of meat was terrible. The last time I checked ribs had a bone in the middle and they were supposed to fall off the bone. These ribs were nothing but fat and mushy.  I had to literally tear apart the meat to tear away at all the fat on the bone. The meal came with 2 sides and cornbread muffin. I got the baked beans and potato wedge fries. The baked beans were really good. Have a little spice with bits of meat. The wedge fries were fresh, big and full of potato. The muffin...not so much. It was hard and tasted like it was cooked 3 days ago. Muffins should be moist and tear apart so butter and honey can be smeared on it. I could have thrown this muffin at the a glass window and it would have shattered to pieces.   I could have caught them on a bad night but I want some consistency. This is how you lose business. Quality is important. Don't cheap it out to save a couple bucks. You are better than this Dave! Please fix this.

Love this place. Always be prepared to spend a lot but it's so worth it! The place is usually always crowded. Lots of shoppers but they also have food samples. This is another way they get you to spend more money.   They serve pizza, hot dogs, ice cream and sandwiches. I've only tried their pizza and I'm not a very big fan. There are others who seem to like though. I see people taking whole pizzas home and others sitting to eat slices.

Worst pizza experience ever. I ordered a pizza that was supposed to be fresh. They told me to pick it up in 20 minutes. My husband was there in 15 minutes.  Apparently someone with the similar name ordered a similar pizza (what are the chances of that) as me. They rang me up under that persons name and my husband told them it was the wrong ticket. After clarifying the correct name and waiting a couple minutes they said the pizza would be out in a minute. The manager asked again what name the pizza was under and gave me my pizza and apparently my pizza was sitting there the whole time. My husband brought home the pizza and it was cold and not at all fresh. I called the manager who was rude and didn't bother to care that the pizza was not fresh. All she kept saying was " the ticket was wrong but you got your pizza" I told the pizza was disgusting and she refused to listen. Customer service was poor. Won't be going here again. I will be contacting the GM of this store.

Best Thai good I have ever tasted. I usually order the # 6 lunch special extra hot with extra chicken. It is the same as the #24 on the dinner menu. It is the best I have ever tasted. They also have very good soup. My favorite is the chicken with rice soup which is the lunch soup. If you are ever in the area you have to try this place. You can't go wrong!

Only giving 2 stars and here is why. 1 star because the price was right. They have a Wednesday special for 50% off your order when you order online using coupon code Wed50 and the other star because of all the fresh ingredients.   I have been longing to try this place. I constantly see the commercials and love pizza but was not at all impressed with the quality and taste. I drive by this place everyday and there are multiple locations across the valley but I was really expecting more from my local take and bake pizza shop.   The instructions say to bake at 425 for 12-18 minutes. I baked for 12 and continued to baked until my desired crispness. The pizza comes on a thin white paper plate/cardboard box to cook on but when I checked my pizza after 15 minutes the pizza was still doughy on the bottom. The cheese was melting and turning brown on top but when I cut a slice to make sure it was done the pizza went limp and the cheese almost fell to the floor. I tried to continue cooking to see if the bottom would cook more but the cheese from the rest of the pizza kept bubbling over the sides. My perfectly prepared pizza now looking like melted cheese stuck to a cardboard box.   I'll stick to my grocery store pizza or have it made and delivered to my door. This was a disaster.

Don't get me wrong, I love shopping at fry's. They are usually the cheapest but I absolutely hate this location. Lets start with the parking lot. It is the worst designed parking lot I have ever seen. The lighting is bad and most of the spots were you can park are a good ways away from the actual entrance.  When you first walk into the store and to the right is were they store the carts. ITS FILTHY!! This place is definitely in need of some remodeling. The rest of the store is okay but I will definitely drive further to another fry's then shop at this location.

I am in this store everyday. I love fry's. They are the cheapest but lack on product availability. There has been several times this store has changed the layout and discontinued items that I frequently buy leaving me with no other option but to shop somewhere else. They do know me by name though.

I'm a big teppanyaki lover and I've tried several different places but I wasn't too impressed with the way they prepare the food here. I ordered the filet and shrimp and the shrimp was like rubber. It tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way and it was very disappointing. The Filet was good but I've definitely had better from other places. They offer chicken fried rice for 2.50 extra and our chef drowned it in soy sauce so it almost looked like soup when he put it in the bowl. Everyone loves chicken fired rice and he just ruined it!   The best part is when they toss the shrimp to see if you can catch it in your mouth. If your lucky enough you may get a shot and they give you free sake.   I haven't tried the Kobe steak yet, it is super expensive unless you are out for a special occasion. A lot of other reviewers seem to like the sushi.  I guess I'll have to miss out because I won't be coming back. I'll just keep going back to Benihana's! They never disappoint.

I love their group exercise class! Roberta is the best instructor and she really puts your body to the test. They also have Zumba every night Monday thru Thursday at 8:00 PM, Friday at 6:00 PM and Saturday at 11:30 PM. Laura is my favorite Zumba instructor and she works the Saturday class.   Gym has lots of different options for a great workout too!

This pizza is excellent. I've been here a couple of times and have never been disappointed. They have an assortment of pizzas, calzones, and salads. I've never tried their calzones but every time I come here I just happen to sit next to someone who orders one so I get a glimpse from the corner of my eye and they look pretty good. As far as the service, waiters/waitresses are prompt and attentive. Never have any issues! Only giving 4 stars because I wish they offered more on the menu. Maybe bread or breadsticks and some pasta.

I had been wanting to try this place for a long time. I saw so many of my friends checking in, looked at the reviews and photos and thought the food looked pretty good. Big disappointment! This place was not very appealing to me at all. I had the bangers and mash. This is what most people talked about in their reviews so I had to try. You can't go wrong with sausage, mashed potatoes, onions, and gravy all wrapped tight in a crispy pastry right? Wrong...I was expecting something way better. It was gooey and mushy and it just didn't have the taste I was expecting. My husband had the Cajun chicken and he wasn't too pleased either. He ate all of his but he never likes wasting food so that's why his was gone before I could even finish my first half. He really liked the sauce that came on the side so I think that was the only plus for him. The only reason I face this place 2 stars instead of 1 was because the pastry was still pretty good. It was nice and crispy and fresh. I wonder if the will just sell me the pastry, that is the only reason I will ever go back.

The chairs are too close together in the dining area but the food is always good. Lemon pepper traditional are always good with a blue moon.   Chile con queso dip for an appetizer is never a disappointment. Always so fresh and tastes soooo good.

Strawberry banana smoothies are the best. They are made fresh when you walk in the door. It's a little cluttered and no room for you to relax and sit down after a nice long work out but I guess I can't complain too much it's a vitamin shop that just happens to sell good drinks. They sell a variety of vitamins and proteins bars too for all your needs.

This place disappointed me. I've had my fair share of yogurts, gelato, and  ice cream and this place was really sub par. When you first walk in the place it is nicely decorated and clean. They have a TV and plenty of places to sit both indoor and outdoor. What I'm most disappointed about was their selection of yogurt, or should I say lack there of. The selections they did have just weren't that good. I didn't think there was such a thing as bad frozen yogurt but I guess there is. Yogurt was very bland with no flavor. They do have an assortment of toppings which would have been great on a bowl of good yogurt. Unfortunately, I won't get to try those topping. Definitely won't be coming back.   Only giving 2 stars. One for the cleanliness and decor of the store and one for the assortment of toppings.

Took my family here for dinner on a Tuesday. Chose this place over Buffalo Wild Wings. BIG MISTAKE. Food was horrible! Tuesday's they have .35 cent wings ( didn't know this until we say down and looked at the menu ) but the wings were super greasy, small, no meat, and tasted very bland. I hate restaurants that promote specials like its a deal and all the do is take away from the quality. Very disappointed and will never go here again. Should have stuck with what I know best, Buffalo Wild Wings!

This place deserves no stars if I could. I've read some of the yelp reviews and based on the feedback I thought it would be worth the try. Bad idea, I was soooooooo dissapointed. I ordered the orange chicken and husband ordered Kung  Pao Chicken. The chicken didn't even taste  like real meat. Not sure what the hype is about this place but I'll pass. I will never eat here again!

I have read the recent reviews of the long wait times and I'm shocked to hear of other's not so great experiences. Every time I have come here I have never had to wait. It has been a few simple forms and then I'm in and out in no time. I have never had to use the online check in because the service has been so quick. The front office clerk is super helpful and very pleasant. The NP are always very informative to make sure you fully understand what is going on and all instructions are clearly presented. Never a concern when I come here because I know me and my family are in great hands.

The person that saw my daughter didn't seem very knowledgable about a solution and we had to ask probing questions to get information that we feel they should have provided to us without us having to ask. The end result was they wanted us to send our daughter to a children's hospital because they said her oxygen was low. She gave us a feeling of uncertainty and we left feeling more disappointed and unsure as to why we even went there in the first place. We never ended up taking her to the children's hospital and bought a device to monitor her until we could see her normal pediatrician. Her oxygen levels were fine the whole night after we had our daughter cough to get some of the congestion from her chest so she could breathe a little better. We followed up with the pediatrician the next day and  she too felt that it was unnecessary for them to recommend going to a children's hospital. Our pediatrician gave her a breathing treatment to clean her lungs a bit and an antibiotic and she was on her way to recovery. I will not recommend based off this last experience . You did nothing to assist me and you wasted my time and my money.

I've been a big fan of local owners. I try to support all local business because they care about their quality of food and there is usually consistency when it comes to food quality and service which is a must when I choose what food places I like to frequent.   This place is know for their boba and donuts, hints the name of the business, but they also serve a variety for Vietnamese food like pho, egg rolls and sandwiches. I come here quite often for lunch because they pho is really good. I haven't had their sandwiches but there is a pretty steady clientele who comes in to order, I figure they must be doing something right. I'm not a big boba fan but they serve smoothies, coffee and Thai tea. Donuts are always made fresh daily and so moist they melt in your mouth.  They owners are always present onsite and are very friendly people. They used to have a shop in Tempe that they shut down and decided to put more time into the service at this location which is great. Most the food is made to order so be prepared to wait for lunch but it is well worth if you want fresh food.   Definitely a frequent for me.

Their menu consists of chicken strips and chicken sandwiches which is just the chicken strips on a bun. The chicken is all white meat and lightly breaded. Super moist and melts in your mouth. If you get a combo it comes with their special made sauce. Fries are okay and sweet tea is pretty good. I gave this place only 4 stars because the chicken is always fresh but the sauce is terrible. My kids rave of this place and absolutely love the sauce. I'm not too impressed but I would go back.

Omg, I am in Cajun heaven. So how did I end up her...well, I've passed by this place several time. It used to be called Cajun Kitchen. One day I stopped in after I was craving some good Cajun food and the place was shut down. Well my craving came back and noticed this Cajun place was back in the same spot but under a different name. Shout out to Kate M.!! I read her review and I was salivating of all the nice things she had to say about this place and the photos she posted so I had to give it a try.   When we first walked in I noticed the music they were placing and it definitely gave it a Louisiana feel. The place isn't very big but comfortably spaced so you don't feel like you will smack the person behind you if you turn around too quick. We were immediately greeted by hostess who seated us in a nice location so that we could get a good view of the rest of the place since this was my first time here. We ordered cup of chicken gumbo as I was so eager to satisfy my Cajun craving.  Didn't take too long and the food came with a side of their succulent garlic bread. Gumbo was super good and I wish I would have ordered the bowl but I didn't want to get too full because there were so many other things I wanted to try. I ended up ordering the shrimp etouffee which was good but it had an overwhelming amount of onions. I can definitely say I will be back to try other things on the menu but gumbo is a must.   Great fast service and great place for Cajun food.

This place is super cool. Just about anything you need to be beautified or to smell like a celebrity this is the place to go. I can spend hours in this store just looking and testing all of the great products they have to offer. I just recently had to come here more often because Walgreens and CVS stopped selling the foundation that I like. They have a generous amount of staff to assist you and are always warm and welcoming. Come here if you can't find what you need at other beauty stores, they will definitely have it. Great job Ulta!

I should have know better then to come here. I live close to here and there was just something that I didn't like about this place. I couldn't tell you why or what but I just wasn't feeling this place. Granted you don't see an Urgent Care and walk around telling people "I want to try that place one day" but in an urgent situation this would not be my first choice even though I live literally 2 minutes away. I usually go to Fast Med which is about 1.8 miles but they had already closed.  Anyway...It was about 20 minutes to closing and I had no other choice to give this place a try and see what it was about. The lady at the front counter...RUDE. Need I say no more. No smile, no welcome in, no nothing. Just a sense that she was annoyed that I came 20 minutes before closing. She didn't even bother to make eye contact with me. Just gave me paperwork to fill out and asked for my ID and drivers license.   After I finished filling out my paperwork the nurse came to the door and just stood there. Didn't say a name and was just staring like we could read his mind that he was ready to take the next patient. I assumed it was us since we were the only ones in the lobby and proceeded to the door. My baby is screaming her head off and he is moving in slow motion. We get to a room and he starts taking her vitals. He starts counting on his fingers trying to figure out her blood pressure..WTF he takes like 5 minutes trying to figure out what number he need to put down. He goes to take her temperature and he can't get the probe cover out of the box. By this time I'm fed up but then the doctor walks in. She goes through her routine and tells me the medicine she is prescribing will make her feel better by the morning. That was definitely a misstatement. My daughter was actually worse off after taking this medicine and cried most of the day. I had to end up taking her to another urgent care and I told the doc what the previous urgent care told me about her feeling better. She politely told me that they should have never told me that and gave me a real explanation as to why she was feeling the way she was. They gave me a different prescription and I could already tell it was working better for her.    The only good thing I can say about this place is I was in and out pretty quick but the staff and level of service I received was not a very good experience. I will gladly drive further down the road then to ever come to this place again.

They offer wraps, paninis and make your own salads. It is pretty healthy and since I'm trying to lose weight, like everyone else for the new year, this place works out great for me.   I really like their green chicken wrap. It is a spinach wrap with grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, green apple, smoked Gouda cheese and creamy chipotle dressing. The whole mixture is super good. I will definitely have to come back to try something else on the menu

I've passed this place a couple times as I eat at the pizza place across the way so I finally decided to give it a try. They have an assortment of Burgers, Dogs, Salads, and Sandwiches. I had a cheeseburger and it was phenomenal. The meat was juicy and all the veggies were fresh. The bun was warm and super soft. They serve it with a knife stuck in the top so you can immediacy cut into it and see the nice pink center ( I like mine med well ). You can get it with chips or fries. I got it with fries and this is the reason I only give it 4 stars. All of the pictures I saw on yelp show crinkle cut fries but I got regular plan non crinkle cut fries. I'm a sucker for crinkle cut so this really disappoint me. The fries they have now aren't good. BRING BACK THE CRINKLE CUT PLEASE .  As for the service, waitresses were great and super accommodating. It was hard to find them at times but they were very social able. I could tell there were a lot of regulars as I overheard the conversations with others customers around me. The manger was always walking the floor to make sure there was no shenanigans going on. Lots of TVs and great music playing. Will definitely be coming back to try other things on the menu.

I came to this location during my lunch hour and there were about 7 groups of people eating so it seemed pretty slow. When we first walked it there was no one there at the hostess table to greet us and we had to wait about 5 minutes before someone showed up to seat us. The waitress/I don't know what her other job could be, took our drink order and 5 minutes later another guy comes to the table and asks us if someone took our drink order. I said yes someone took our order and he tells us that he thinks she got tied up with something and asks us again what we ordered. At this point I was getting pretty upset. I could tell the service was not going to be that great. We continued to look at the menu and I ordered gumbo for starters. The gumbo is served in a plastic bowl as if it were purchased at the store and tasted like it was reheated in the microwave. It had tons of rice and was very skimpy on the meat side. It was okay but I've had way better gumbo.   We order the shrimp trifecta ( headless) and the crab trifecta. It didn't take too long for the food to arrive and both were really good. The food is served in a bag and can get pretty messy so make sure you wear your bib. The trifecta has lots of flavor and really gives the seafood a great taste. I'll come back to try other things on the menu but the overall service is crap! I hope the managers read these reviews and get this fixed.

Fish, wings, chicken, and shrimp pretty much sums it up. The choices for fish are Tilapia and catfish. They have traditional or boneless wings,  fried shrimp, fried chicken, and chicken nuggets. They do serve a variety of different appetizers and side dishes to go with the meals.   Now for my 1 star rating...I originally ordered Catfish nuggets. When my meal came out they brought me a whole catfish. I looked at my receipt and showed them I wanted the nuggets. They took the food away and began making what I ordered. Mind you the food is made to order and took about 15 minutes to make in the first place so now I have to wait another 10 minutes for them to remake my meal. When the food finally arrived they brought me my food and told me the have me a few extra nuggets. I thought that was a nice gesture but they let the same sides they had given me before on my place so it was not fresh and it was cold. I ate the catfish nuggets expecting it to satisfy the hunger pains since I had waited so long for my food to come out. What a disappointment. The fish was so bland, no flavor, no seasoning and smelled like it was fresh out the ocean. Beware of the fish I would not recommend. I was with 2 other people and 1 order chicken nuggets which were pretty good. We had to ask for sauce because they never asked us.  My other friend order jumbo shrimp. He loved the shrimp. This was probably the best thing out of everything that we ordered. It came with fries but the fries didn't have any salt on them and tasted like they were cooked in bad grease. The baked beans were hard and dried out like they had been reheated in the microwave several times. It's too bad this place didn't work out I was excited to see a new restaurant to try.  I will not be going back.

First off, most the pictures I looked appeared to be chicken wings...drummettes and flats or some sort of that combo but when you look at the menu you can order by whole or half chicken. ??? Confused look. Ok, so we ordered anyway. Half of garlic honey chicken and half sweet spicy chicken. Food comes out and I now have a half chicken cut up in pieces deep fried and covered with their special sauce. It is a best to use a fork and knife to cut pieces of meat but beware you will never know when you will bite into a bone or if it will be white or dark meat. Now mind you, the food looks amazing but I was not at all impressed with the honey garlic chicken or the thought of biting into a bone or some other piece of inedible part of the chicken. When I'm eating I kinda like to know what pieces I should or shouldn't be eating. I don't mind working for good food but this was too much and prices were pretty expensive. Not worth it for me.
