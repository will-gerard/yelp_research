I had such amazing service from two individuals in the flooring dept. at this Home Depot that I just had to Yelp about it.  Before I sing their praises in particular, let me just say that in my experience Home Depot has raised the bar on customer service overall as a company over the last few years.  Remember the days of walking in to what felt like a football field of tools, paint, etc., and feeling like there wasn't a customer service rep in sight?  Thank goodness those days at Home Depot are over!  I have experienced this at several locations in the Valley area; everytime I turn a corner or am looking for something, someone is right there ready to assist.    Back to the service I received at this particular location...if you are looking for information about wood flooring, carpet, etc., and you live anywhere near this area it is worth the drive.  Find Chris or Lisa; they are both incredibly knowledgable, helpful, enjoyable to work with and will do whatever they can to help you make the right decision without being "pushy" at all.  I went in simply looking for ideas about what type of flooring I might want in a new home; I left feeling committed to buying whatever I buy when the time is right from Chris and Lisa.  Sometimes we forget big huge companies are made up of individual people just like the rest of us who want to do a good job, be recognized for working hard and to enjoy where we work and who we work for.  It was a nice eye-opener to see how a huge American retailer has instilled such loyatly and pride in its team members.

I have been remiss in not writing my review sooner; Razz's is now closed for summer.  I enjoyed the best meal I've ever had in my 7.5 years living in Phoenix at Razz's earlier this year.  I couldn't even tell you all the delicious things I ate now, but that's exactly the point.  I didn't order for myself - I sat at the bar and ordered the Chef's tasting menu.  Razz himself decided what he wanted us to have and stayed with us thoughout the entire meal.  He is quite the entertainer and a very interesting man, to boot.  He knows his food is good and he will certainly be happy to tell you!  The time he takes off during the summer he spends traveling the world and tasting food from all over, so he knows how his cuisine measures up.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you - the inside is quite quaint and if you're going to spend the money to get a good meal in this town, turst me you won't be disappointed!

Cafe Boa appears to be an institution headed for disaster.  I have worked nearly across the street from the "new" Cafe Boa on Mill Ave. for over 5 years.  I have been for lunch, happy hour and dinner MANY times.  For years while I was never a big fan of the lunch menu and the happy-hour-only-in-the-bar-area was a nuisance, I still frequented the place often and always enjoyed the atmosphere, the food (for the most part) and the staff - notice I did not say the service.  These are two very different things...  My horrific experience at the restaurant and the one that has caused me to writie this one-star review was over dinner on a Monday night a few weeks ago.  My party purposefully selected the restaurant that night to check out their 1/2 off bottles of wine promotion.  We understood from the extremely fine print on the table tent that the promotion required the purchase of two entrees to qualify.  Not a problem; at least not until we got our food and the halibut I ordered was like a hair-covered mystery.  No sauce, just terrible.  We informed our waiter (whose service was particually BAD on this occassion) and he removed the fish from our bill, as by that point I was not interested in ordering something else as was offered.    Tragedy seemed to be avoided until we recieved the bill.  All in all we ordered three bottles of wine (for 4!).  The bill came and only one of the bottles was 1/2 off.  Clearly NOT our expectation.  We inquired about this issue and were informed that because I rejeccted my fish we did not qualfiy for enough entress for the special to be offered on ONE of the two bottles in question.  ONE?  Why only one?  Welll....that would be because the fine print that was not visible (as in NOT PRINTED AT ALL) and that was also not communicated to us was that it is ONE bottle at the 1/2 special per every two entrees.  Rediculous!  You would think our waiter, horrible or not, would have clarified this when we ordered the 3rd bottle, right?  Rather than make a total scene in front of our guests, we asked for the manager's contact information and spoke to him the next day.  We explained our plight, assuming he would SURELY appreciate us bringing this to his attention to avoid such confusion in the future and so as not to lose us as customers.  Wrong.  He simply said there was nothing "more" he could do.  More?  What did he do in the first place?  To bring an end to this sad story, I had happy hour with a friend a few weeks later at Mill Ave.'s newest hip, reasonably-priced, cafe with fantastic atmosphere - La Bocca.  When updating one another about recent social occassions she told me she and her boyfriend had gone to Cafe Boa earlier in the week and also gotten tricked by the one bottle 1/2 off wine special.  So sad; I went out of my way to make sure they knew how damaging something like their failure to make the "rules" of the promotion perfectly clear are to a long-standing customer and they chose to do nothing about it.  We'll see how long they last...In the meantime, I'll see you at La Bocca!

I have been to this place a couple of times now for lunch and really enjoy it.  It has a small menu with just a few sandwich and salad options; you can also get breakfast all day (I believe).  They are known (apparently) for coffee, which I have not yet had the pleasure of enjoying.  I had the veggie wrap the first time and tuna salad sandwich today - LOVED the dill spice in the tuna.  Very fresh and well...D'lish.

Try it again!  This place has a VERY cool, W Hotel-esque, vibe on the interior and is under new ownership.  They were open for a short time earlier this year, but don't let the early reviews cloud your judgment.  The new owner liked the theme so kept the name.  A bit risky, but it is a great theme.  Regions stands for a varying menu featuring recipes from different areas of the country.  The service was good - they are really trying hard to get a local following going, so ask for a 15% local discount card and a frequent diner's card.  The prices are reasonable and...the food is really good.  All the right ingredients...let's just hope they can stay alive on Mill Ave.
