This is the best dental office I've ever been to.  The level of detail and explanation that they give you is excellent.  They show you photos and X-rays over time on monitors and really take the time to explain every detail of your dental health.  They are friendly and have the best technology available. I couldn't recommend them more highly.

Stuart really helped me in choosing the perfect luggage for my frequent business travel. He was never pushy, but took the time to listen to my needs and give me options for meeting them. Two years after making my purchase, I am glad I went with his recommendations and would highly recommend that others give this shop a try.  I know I wouldn't have done as well in a larger store without the expert help Stuart provided.  The personalized service really made the difference for me in making the right purchase.

My favorite upscale Indian restaurant in Phoenix, hands down.  Their food is just more flavorful and more carefully prepared than anywhere else.  And the atmosphere is date-worthy.  As good as the best Indian restaurants in major cities like Chicago and San Francisco.  This is the only Indian restaurant in Phoenix about which that can be said.

I buy a lot of gifts for my wife here.  The hand-made original artisan jewelry is really nice.  They have a bunch of other unique gift-items, clothes, etc. for the more indie-minded.

In my opinion, Hana on 7th Ave. has the best sushi in town, but I just moved to Scottsdale and thought I'd try this highly-rated place.  Got violently ill a few hours after eating here.  Besides that, the service was horrible, the fish was average, and the creativity of the sushi was poor.  Never again!

I ordered delivery based on positive yelp reviews and was wildly disappointed.  Worse than school cafeteria pizza.  Flaccid crust.  Nasty ketchup-esque sauce.  Just abysmal.  I assume the wings are amazing, because the pizza is among the worst I've ever had.

Some of the best you can get in Phoenix.  Great falaffel & schwarma.  Very consistent.  Always good.

Really mediocre bland pizza.  Overly thick crust for wood-fired.  Every ingredient, from crust to cheese to toppings to sauce was lackluster and flavorless. On plus side it is clean and decorated in an inoffensive modern manner.  Recommend against. Go to Pomo nearby instead.

Nice atmosphere, especially outside patio.  Strange to see some people dressed gym casual on a Friday night, as well as some kids.  They poured Chimay into a pilsner glass, so bad marks for that.  Falaffel appetizer was nice, but Falaffel itself was too finely ground and flavorless.  Salads were really outstanding.  Enchiladas, also, were very good.  Thai short ribs were pretty good as well.  Great dessert options.  Overall pricey, but fair.

I highly recommend not going here.  The salads were the only things that were even average.  I had the Bacon wrapped shrimp.  Overpriced for what you get and bad sauces.  Wife had the grilled cheese, which should be impossible to screw up, right?  Wrong.  A triple-decker that had the quality of a school cafeteria grilled-cheese.  Just wonder-bread and processed cheese.  Fries were probably frozen and bought at Food City.  They try to pass off their fare as creative and price it for Scottsdale, but it is subpar ingredients cooked by an amateur.  Only thing going for it was the friendly staff.

No one gets our three dogs as clean as Shampooch.  One reason is that they use higher quality products and don't dilute them like other places do.  The groomers are wonderful and do a great job even with our dog who hates going to the groomer.  Another good sign is that it is always clean and calm in there which is not the norm for most groom shops.  They are very professional and love dogs, and we wouldn't go anywhere else!

It was not as good as its word of mouth suggests.  A sophisticated if limited menu of some hits and some misses.  Liked the cheese plate.  Fried green tomatoes were fine, but not the best I've had.  Grilled broccoli was good, but not great.  Butternut squash pasta was not well-balanced, and we didn't finish it.  Ribeye was well-prepared, but intensely garlicy.  Interesting Arizona wine selection was generally good.  Butterscotch pudding was sublime.  Everything was overpriced by about 15% to my way of thinking.  Atmosphere was cozy and intimate, but also air conditioning felt like it was set too hot at 80.  Service was attentive, but in watching other tables, I think our server did not take as much time and effort to guide and inform us as others did.  Bottom line, I did not leave feeling like my palette had been as fully satisfied as I'd hoped and expected, especially for the money we spent.  I don't think we will go back, because there are better options, like St. Francis, etc., but we may check it out again once their seasonal menu changes again.

Tremendous!  Great beer and wine selection.  Fantastic, loaded salads.  Creative selection of sides and sandwiches that all deliver.  Cool patio.  Nice atmosphere inside as well.  Dark, hip, chill, great music.  Laid back, friendly, attentive service.  Perfect first time, and I'll be back next week for more.

True Foods is our go to restaurant in North Scottsdale.  They offer great service, a bright and airy atmosphere, and really wonderful and fresh food.  Also they have creative and unique cocktails.  You can't go wrong on their menu, and they have actually influenced my tastes over time to eat more vegetables which they prepare so deliciously.

The best sandwich shop in the city.  Wonderful, creative combinations of ingredients.  Great salads.  Fantastic breakfast items served all day.  Cool, hip atmosphere.  Three days in a row now.  My new favorite lunch spot.

I moved from my Chiro of 5 years to the Joint and have never looked back.  The Doctors are great, personable, and take the time to get to know your issues.  It is so welcoming, and after over a year I feel like I'm part of the family there.  And it is an amazing deal!  Thanks to all the great doctors for keeping me adjusted and healthy!

This Pizza is not any better or cheaper than the equivalent places that deliver.  Add to that the inconvenience of having to pick it up and cook it, and it is just not worth it at all.

Lentils?  Really???  People who eat Mexican food have been known on occasion to enjoy beans, be they refried or black, but never a lentil.  Though having tried a number of other dishes at Taco Haus, I believe the choice of lentils and bland white rice as accoutrements was so that the other food would not be overpowered by flavorful sides.  Also strange was the need to ask for salsa, which then arrived straight from the Pace jar, in a small to go plastic cup, which really enhanced the upscale casual dining experience.  It isn't the location that will eventually kill this place, it is the odd choices that lead o a clunky execution.

Decent craft beer selection and frequent rotation.  Nice atmosphere. Tons of TV's playing sports if that is what you're in to.  Food depends on your perspective. If you are looking for average bar food, this will be good enough.  If you are more discriminating about your food, then you will probably find that most everything is inedible.  At our table, the chopped salad was passable, the melts were greasy, undercooked messes.  My wife's veggie burger was one bite and done awful. Worst I've ever tasted.  Regular burger was dry with an overly greasy bun.  The truffle fries were so dry, and the truffle flavor tasted cheap.  Spiked milkshake was average. The menu is creative for bar food but poorly executed.  Service was attentive but a bit spacey. When we mentioned that the uneaten veggie burger was bad, the server apologized but did not offer to take it off the check, which would have been nice, but fine whatever, just a sign of inexperienced and poorly trained service.  All in all I would go back, but only for the atmosphere, the beer, and to try some of their semi-creative cocktails.  I would never order food again, but I admit that have high standards for food.

It isn't real Indian food.  I thought the food was unusually sweet, like they were putting too much sugar in it, which is a trick restaurants use to get you to like otherwise average food.  Nice atmosphere.  Iced tea was really good.  Salad greens were not super fresh.  Chicken was sparse in Tikka Masala.  Cooked vegetables were overcooked. Raita was soooo sweet I couldn't eat it.  There are a bunch of 5 star reviews, but be careful, because they are offering gift certificates for Yelp reviews. They had a "restaurant consultant" there who was driving the turnaround of this place, which is by the same people who did the failed Bombay Spice.  They are definitely playing the Yelp game.  I am not saying this place was terrible or anything... just not remotely authentic and pretty average despite all the pumped up Yelp reviews.  I would give it 3 stars were it not for all the Yelp gaming they are doing, which for me knocks it down another star.
