Tonight I met 20 new Meetup friends at Christos for dinner.  What a great experience.  It's always challenging for a restaurant to handle large groups - but especially large groups with individual checks.  Our Service Team was outstanding and it was seamless that they were handling such a large group.  I had the cioppino with a variety of seafood that was clearly fresh and yummy.  The complimentary soup and bread were memorable on their own.  The only disappointment was the extremely strong fresh pepper on the salad.  The lemon cake...to die for.  Dinner was delizioso.

Very disappointing.  I was really looking forward to a clubby bar with great appetizers and conversation.  I arrived first, valet parked, walked downstairs to the bar, turned around walked back out and told my friend to meet me at Richardson's instead.  Downstairs was too small.  Too dark.  Too warm with the fireplace going.  Bar was packed and the chairs and couch I tried weren't comfortable.  I also checked out the upstairs bar which was too exposed to the kitchen and garbage.

Horrible.  Shop was unbearably hot.  Dress were ALL size 6 tall.  Sales staff seemed disengaged.  Only our party and another party in shop on Saturday.  Both left very unhappy with experience.  Ran into the other party at Suzanne's in Gilbert the next day.  Both parties bought gowns at Suzanne's and shared our bad experience with Arizona Bridal.  My daughter 4'11".  Her daughter 5'7".  Neither could get a satisfactory picture of a gown from a size 6 tall sample.

I've been taking my dogs to Banfield and hating every minute of it.  I always feel ripped off by my final bill.  I switched to Sunburst today.  Couldn't believe the incredible friendliness and service and when I went to pay the bill I expected about $225 (based on Banfield pricing) and it was ONLY $60.  My dog says Woof!

OK I'm back again to say how great they are.  My dog started limping yesterday and they fit me in today on a very busy holiday.  In and out quickly and cheaply.  They are my vet for life.

Food was good.  Blueberry pancakes weren't on the menu but they made them for me.  Place was packed on a late Saturday morning.  Upscale cars outside in a marginal neighborhood so they are driving to the ghetto just for Eye Opener.  Decor tacky.  Service - INCREDIBLE!  So good I doubled my tip.

I took two family members with me.  We ordered steak subs, soda and split one order of fries.  About $38...everyone was dissatisfied with price and steak sandwich.  We won't be returning.

We have been going here for years.  Our little neighborhood, hidden treasure.  The food is authentic, large portions, and they make it quickly while you wait.  Former taco bell building.  No ambience but nothing bad either.  Great prices for the quantity.  Wish they had a drive thru.

Still great.  Bought the Rolando's special breakfast burrito this morning.  Asked him to cut it in half.  I ate the first half with their homemade green sauce for breakfast and will eat the second half for dinner.  It's that big for $5.

The food sucks but I buy it because I go for the Strawberry fruitista which are SOOOO good.  But this month they blew in 3 times.  Machine broken, out of stawberries, machine frozen up. Guess I have to call before I go to make sure I can get a fruitista.

Awesome fun place for all ages until curfew time when they kick kids out.  Plenty of fun playing pool, shuffleboard, darts...Great service.  Nice people. Diverse music.  Only downside is the food.  It's soooo bad don't even waste your money on it.

My last review was a long time ago and it was about the bread so I decided to try them again today.  Bread...100% better.  Tuna they put between the bread...awful.  Looked brown, low quality and had the sweetness of Miracle Whip not Mayo.  It was probably mayo but with too much sweet pickle mixed in.  I was so disappointed...I didn't complain...I just brought it home and gave it to my dogs.  If I ever go back...it will have to be for cold cuts which stand on their own merit.  Sorry I want local businesses to florish. Hope owner checks it out.

Salad bar was really good including peel and eat shrimp but the fish and chips were AWFUL.  Three tiny pieces that looked like they came out of a fish sticks box from the grocery freezer section.  So disappointing.  Either do it right or take it off the menu.

Not to my taste.  Grew up on real Chinese food in California and this is not it.  No flavor. Quality of both beef and chicken seemed low grade.  Fried Won Tons were not crispy.  Over an hour wait for delivery.  No return experience for me.

I had a craving for spaghetti with meatballs, salad and garlic bread but didn't want to sit in a restaurant alone so I stopped at Napoli for to go order.  Disappointment multipled.  Unappealing flavor for spaghetti sauce, pasta not done enough, garlic bread turned out to be a sub roll that I had to turn into garlic bread at home myself, no salad included in take out orders and so so meatballs.  Frowny faces from the guys working there.  Only bright light was the woman who smiled out me when she handed me my drink.

Is a Chef in training cooking here at night?.  Stopped by expecting same ole breakfast fare.  Ordered the Deluxe Skillet.  It was upscale, it was yummy and it was a huge portion so I took enough home for a second meal tomorrow.  I sent my compliments back to the Chef something I've never ever done at Denny's.  Service was great also.

Great selection, great service, great experience.  They found 'the dress' for my daughter by the 3rd dress she tried on.  They listened to her likes and dislikes and understood her figure.   This was the first shop we visited and after 3 more shops went back and bought 'the dress'.

What a disappointment!  Based on reviews and buzz I selected AZ88 for an after concert dinner and drink.  First of all even with Google maps hard to find.  Secondly waitress was terrible.  No personality.  Didn't check back on drink status.  Third food was mediocre at best.  Fourth the music was so thumping loud couldn't even talk to table mate.  Fifth vibe was cold.  Never again.  Don't understand why this restaurant is still open when so many good ones have gone under.

Very disappointed...it wasn't even OK and I was expecting more especially for the price.  I invited my friend to join me for Sunday brunch which starts at 10 am.  We got there closer to 11 am and the brunch food was not ready.  No labels identifying the food or the main contents of it.  Inadequate tools to dip or pick up the food.  Gravy with nothing to put it on??? Quiche was not homemade.  It was still in the disposable frozen pie tin.  I drove all that way for the special orange ricotta pancakes which tasted like every other pancake.  No butter or syrup for pancakes or french toast.  I asked for syrup which they brought to me in a personal size container but after I poured it they took it away and placed it on the buffet.  WTF?  Asked waitress how they made the french toast...no freakin clue. There was one dish with white sauce that was amazing but I can't tell you what it was or ever order it again BECAUSE THERE WERE NO FOOD LABELS.

If you don't shop for furniture here than you aren't a Phoenix insider.  I've purchased several pieces, at reasonable prices, over the years.  Your stuff won't look like anyone else's.  You need to visit frequently because furniture turns over that quickly AND it's a fun afternoon adventure.  The majority of the furniture is resale from estate sales although they do have some new pieces.  Next door is a cool accessory shop.  I'm moving from a big house to a condo and have to keep telling myself NO don't buy anything until you move into the new place and feel the space.

Hated it.  Expected HUGE wedding superstore with all kinds of decorations instead it's mostly wedding party clothes.  Air conditioning was working very well.  Sales rep wasn't listening to what I said I wanted and brought horrible dresses to me.

i stopped by multiple places today just to find a kitchen cabinet door.  Finally I found a single cabinet with the right door still on it here.  $40.  That's all I needed but the rest of the place had a huge selection of doors, windows, granite, etc.  I wish they sold appliances and more lighting fixtures.

Not a fan.  I stayed at one of these in Tucson near the airport and would not have booked in Phoenix if I had realized it was the same hotel.  First I find the colors and styles in the room depressing and outdated.  Second something was wrong with the toilet.  Apparently the seal around the bottom of the toilet was wierdly caulked and the toilet was not stable.  Surprised it didn't leak.  Each time I used the room key it took about 6 attempts to get in...not fun.  No room service OK - but if you are going to order made to order food (crummy I'm sure) don't make me go downstairs to get it.  The lobby does not have a clear check in area (it's part of the bar/food area...).  The A/C wouldn't let me crank it down enough to get cold for sleeping.  The time frame for breakfast on the weekend was wierd and short.  On the positive side it is conveniently located, the room was clean and the check in clerk was nice so I guess it depends on what your priorities are..

Saturday night - it was packed but the music and the patio helped the wait.  Family get together.  Party of 9 - all ages.  All food tastes.  Oysters, alligator, crab, shrimp, catfish, lobster.  We ate it all but the absolute best was the Banana Pudding in a jar.  No one pressured us to hurry up.  We all gave Tony an extra tip for great, friendly service..

It was better than the High Tea at the Brown Hotel in London or the Phoenician in Phoenix and on par with the Empress in Victoria, British Columbia.  It's always hard to find special activities for out of town visitors during the hot Phoenix summer.  I took my cousin from Dallas as a surprise and she loved it.  The treats, choices of tea, china settings, atmosphere and service couldn't have been better.  My cousin was amused that we were going to Carefree and we turned on Easy Street.  Check it out.

Won't be going back.  They have replaced all their vegetable dishes with many versions of bland seafood.  Started several things but had to leave them on my plate because they did not have any flavor.  Great service but bad food.

Based on the positive reviews on Yelp, I visited Shear Paradise today for a haircut, style and massage.  The haircut was really more of a repair-cut from one of the $20 walk in haircut places.  Joyce was able to fit me in on the same day I called.  I got a master haircut and will return.  The masseuse was offering a $1 a minute special so I bought in for $30 worth.  I figured she would just concentrate on my back in a 30 minute session.  I was surprised that she completed a total body massage in 30 minutes by massaging really, really fast but that's OK.  It still felt great.

Nope won't be returning.  Pulled up no one in the place.  Not a customer.  Not an employee.  Was it robbed?  Was everyone locked up?  Nope but they might have been partying in the back because they were creepy pleasant when they came out front to wait on me.  Ordered tuna but it could have been chicken cause it sure didn't have any flavor.  Very bland.  Looking forward to sour dough but the bread wasn't good either.  Manager you need to mystery dine.

I knew I shouldn't have stopped.  All my other visits over the years had been terrible but I was really craving fried shimp and couldn't imagine how they could screw it up.  Well...$8 later after eating 3 flavorless greasy shrimp and picking at the fish I threw it away because I knew I was going to throw up if I ate any more.  It was THAT bad.  Where is the corporate or owner quality control on this product and to make it worse the cashier was an idiot lost in his own world - What's a combo...dah it's a number 9 with chicken.  OK what's a number 9?

Second visit.  First was bad but thought I would try it again.  I was the only customer but the counter guy had phone orders backed up.  Just ordered the two pieces of pizza in hot box to go.  The boxes they gave me were not closed in any way.  Was lucky to get to the car without spilling the pizza out of the boxes.  Way too acidic for my taste.  Ate part of one piece - terrible.  Gave the other half to my dogs and threw the second piece away.  Some one needs to do some quality taste testing.  I love crust and the crust wasn't even worth eating.  Won't be returning.

I left a 17 year relationship with Bank of America for Compass in Oct. 2012.  I'm very happy with the customer service I receive every time I stop by.  There are normally 1-2 tellers working, a new account Specialist and a branch manager with no lines  I don't go in frequently but they are always friendly, helpful and willing to go the extra mile.  I highly recommend them as being a YES bank instead of a NO bank.

I liked the two bar and cove areas for space and ambiance.  Our waitress was really nice but the kitchen was in deep trouble.  We waited over an hour for 3 happy hour small plates - chips and dip, sliders and tostadas.    Easy to create.  We asked the waitress twice and she apologized both times.  Finally I asked if I could order a second glass of wine at happy hour prices since happy hour was long over and I didn't get to eat my food while I drank my wine.  She managed to get a comp glass of wine for me which helped.  I made sure to tip her well because the food delay was not her fault.  Everyone was experiencing the same slowness.  When one table has a problem getting their food it's a mistake.  When none of the tables get their food in a timely manner - is time to fire the expediter.  Once the food came it was a terrible disappointment.  The same bland dry meat with no flavor just hot spice was on the sliders and the tostada and the dip was horrible.  The best part of the meal were the corn chips that clearly came out of a bag.  To make matters worse, I originally stopped in at Rockerij and decided not to stay because it was too hot and too crowded.  Next time we will mosey down 16th street to all the other restaurants/bars that deserve our business.

It's all about the views.  The views from every floor.  The views in every direction.  I lay in my bed on the 7th floor and kept waking to check the changing views as the night progressed into morning.  The most spectacular views were from the Orange Sky restaurant at the top.  The rooms were very GQ.  The beds extremely comfortable.  We splurged on breakfast in bed.  It was great and cheaper than we thought.  The bowl of fruit was my favorite.  We also took advantage of the Spa and Orange Sky experiences for our special birthday weekend.  We didn't play golf but the course looked fantastic.  The downside - the casino.  No one was winning anything and people were smoking all around me.

My niece and I were having that conversation...where do you want to eat...I don't know where do you want to eat when we drove past the Rocket Burger corner.  I turned around to try it because of good Yelp reviews and my curiosity regarding the variety of Soda Pop.  We both got a large hot pastrami sandwich and soda pop.  The price was reasonable, the food was good and the soda pop made it a nostalgic experience.  I brought home half of my sandwich.  Just reheated it in the microwave and enjoyed it again.  I'll return to try the french dip sandwich on the menu.  P.S.  The meat and secret sauce gave the sandwich a great bite.  It blows away the 'roast beef' sandwich I had last week at Subway that looked like reconstituted meat.

Saturday night was a milestone birthday that we chose to celebrate at TSR.  We were pretty excited about dinner at Orange Sky.  Some of that excitement was justified - some was not.  Upon arrival for our 5:00 p.m. sunset dining with a private booth reservation, we were asked to wait in the bar while they got ready for us.  We ordered drinks and waited and waited while others were seated -even after we asked twice it was probably 30 minutes after our reservation time before we were seated and missed the majority of the sunset.  The piano music while we waiting sounded recorded.  The waiter and bus boy were not the level of professionals you would expect for the restaurant.  Nice but goofy.  The private dining booth was wonderful.  Now on to the food.  Oysters great.  Son-In-Law's Rib Eye Steak - wonderful.  My pre-cracked crab wonderful.  My daughter's scallops - disappointing to her to get only 4 scallops on her plate.  Mashed potatoes OK.  Asparagus disappointing - tough.  Bread OK.  Huckleberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream - yummy.  The outdoor patio - breathtaking.  So C for service.  B for food.  A for ambiance.

The Spa has a birthday special but you must go on your actual birthday.  A reduced cost massage for you and a 15% discount for your partner or friend.  My daughter and I took advantage of the special.  The only I regret is that we just scheduled time for the massage and didn't have time to take advantage of all the Spa has to offer - exercise room, jacuzzi, steam room, showers with a view, relaxation room, food and drink.  Next time we are going to set aside several hours for the experience.

Quiet Sunday thought I would check TR out for lunch.  I keep reading great things about the food.  Introduced myself to the bartender and Owner's girlfriend.  Followed  lunch recommendation of Shrimp poorboy and sweet potato tots.  Delicious.  Plan to go back for the food, live music and drinks.  New neighborhood hangout.  Thanks ladies for being so friendly.

Not good.  Went back on a Thursday's Ladies night.  Muscle bound bar tender.  Didn't like his vibe at all.  Terrible food.  Won't be back.  Workers can make or break a place.  Suggest owner mystery shop the days he isn't working.

Went there to see Janeane Garofolo.  She was great.  I like the seating much better here than at the old Improv.  We arrived close to 7pm when the show started and still got seats with great visibility.  Service, drinks and food were really good.  Only good things to say about the whole event except the intro comic sucked wind.  The second comic and JG were great.  I will definitely watch the schedule and return for a good time.

Never, ever go here.  Stopped for gas and decided to give the chicken a try.  Bad signs from the beginning.  Empty.  Corn on the cob FRIED along with everything else but hey how could they ruin chicken strips and fries?  Hopped in the car and started to eat on the road.  Raised chicken to eat and it STUNK!  Had to throw everything away and stop for fast food again at a different business.  I think they have been frying everything in the same grease for years and never ever changing it.  YUCK!

Packed Saturday night and I'm a single lady looking for dinner and a place at the bar.  Service was outgoing and genuine.  Ordered small filet.  Wonderfully flavorful and tender - would have expected a much higher price for this quality steak.  Baked potato could have used more stuff on top.  A little dry.  Bread was fresh and plentiful.  Salad was tasty.  Only downside...bar was too small for this busy of a place.  Could have been doubled in size and still full.  I'l go back to try some of the other other food.

I eat eggs but I'm not a fan of them.  Today I had the best eggs ever on the Brunch Flat Bread at Timo's.  Now I understand why people eat eggs.  The crust was remarkable.  The burrata cheese was a new taste surprise.  Fruit bowl was mostly cantaloupe but that was OK because the quality of the fruit was great.  Service was on point.  Loved the inside vibe.  Can't wait until it cools down to check out the outside vibe.  Only helpful hint...Mimosa was too tart.  Would have preferred more orange juice.  I was there with a brunch group and everyone else had great food too.

Driven by many times.  Decided to stop for lunch today.  Ordered the salad with pulled pork and Carolina BBQ sauce for dressing.  Really, really good with plentiful portions.  Saw a couple of potential lunchers strolling by and suggested they go inside and get the same thing.  I'll be back with friends.

Reminds me of the old Downside.  Randy the owner came over and introduced himself.  Saw people I remembered from the old Downside about 10 years ago.  Didn't eat the food.  I prefer the traditional bar food they used to have.  $5 for a good glass of wine worked for me.  I introduced 6 other ladies to the bar.  We'll all be back on Thursday night.

Bad idea. Tried Hibachi Grill Supreme Buffet tonight. I was sucked in by the 2 sided full page color ad. Over 250 items plus sushi and hibachi. Some of it looked too bad to try and all the things I tried (including snails, octopus, frog legs, sushi rolls and hibachi) were AWFUL. The only good things were the salty shrimp and my glass of Coke. Note to self - never eat any buffet again. I think it was all radioactive products that Japan is dumping on America.

We celebrated my birthday at Oink Cafe today.  Our first time so we shared the flight of  bacon which was enjoyable.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes which were plentiful and juicy.  Quality of tuna in daughter's sandwich was high.  Mimosa was ok but not something I would want to repeat.  Biggest challenge is that I am a short person and the tables are too high.  As a result I had some major spillage on my clothing.  After brunch we had to run to Ross and purchase a replacement blouse so I could continue my Bday activities.

Disappointing.  It was 9 p.m. on a Friday night and I just finished shopping in the area so I stopped by knowing they would be open later than most restaurants.  Seat yourself the sign said and so I did.  The first waitress looked cranky but she got a menu for me.  My waitress seemed nice.  I ordered the fish, shrimp and chips.  Food came out fast but it was a disappointment.  Fish and shrimp were flavorless and over-fried.  The waitress forgot my extra Tartar.  Some where along the way my waitress forgot I existed.  When she stopped by to check on me, I asked for my check.  I got it - put my Visa inside for payment - and she never came back.  Another waitress cleared my plate because I was clearly done.  Every time my waitress came out on the floor I tried to get her attention by motioning and calling to her.  She never, ever looked my way.  Finally after a very long time.  I walked up the the waitress area next to the kitchen and I said I really need to leave and you have forgotten about me - here's my Visa.  She brought the check over for me to sign but then she said she never forgot about me which bothered me because she did.  No reason to ever stop there except for convenience - now no reason to stop all all because slow is not convenient.

3rd visit.  I bring new people with me every time.  Bento boxes were loved.  Sushi combos were loved.  Roll combos were loved.  Crab Ragoons were loved.  Chicken Curry loved.  Service may be a little slow if crowded because Grandma and Grandpa Sushi run the place alone but it's worth the wait.  5 of us ordered whatever we wanted and have leftovers - bill less than $60 with tip.  Would have been $100 for 3 of us at our regular sushi joint.

Quick, friendly and efficient service.  I ordered the French Toast with a side of bacon.  Both were attractive, plentiful and tasty.  Convenient location just off the freeway.  Couple of dollars more expensive than my other breakfast place but it is 3 stars and this one is 4 stars.  There is a difference in what you get.  Only dislike - the seating.  Booths are probably easy to wash off but they are not comfortable.

Second visit - worse than the first.  Ordered ribs.  They should call them boiled ribs instead of BBQ ribs.  Fatty, greasy and pink with no BBQ char at all.  So bad I let the dogs eat some and threw the rest away.  I made myself two pieces of toast instead.

I have to give it four stars because there is nothing else like it at the airport.  Very, very trendy.  Good service.  Reasonable prices.  Delish food.  I had the traditional egg, etc breakfast and the only thing traditional were the eggs.  Toast was presented in a fun way and tasted great.  Definitely high quality bacon but maybe too much pepper on the edge.  Orange juice tasted freshly squeezed.  Potatoes were yummy.  Next time I'm going to try one of the waffles.  This part might surprise you...I wasn't departing or waiting...I just landed at 9pm and saw it on the way to exiting the airport and knew that it was going to be a better meal than fast food on the way home. Go Matt.

Just OK.  I had a Dragon Roll, Tempura Shrimp and a drink and it was $20.  I can go to a real sushi restaurant with real service instead of a fast food counter and pay less than that.  The eel on the roll was bitter.  I've never experienced that in all my years of sushi eating.  The shrimp in the tempura was tasteless.   Big disappointment all around.
