So, I visited Phoenix recently and some of my friends took me out for Sushi at SakeBomber's.  "I thought, sushi in the desert are you kidding me?"  But being 26 and adventurous, I thought, why not.    We arrive, and to be honest, the exterior was a little awkward, it wasn't your typical family Japanese restaurant with an old lady at the front greeting you.  We walk in and was pleasantly surprised as this was a restaurant people like me and the rest of my friends.  Young working class people.  Our hostess fixed our table right away, as we had a party of 10 people, we were rolling 3 cars deep.  We sat down, and were again surprised by the pricing of both the food and the drinks.  This was the beginning of a LEGEN (wait for it) DARY night.    My friends ordered the full sakebomber set for $5 bucks, that's the price for 1 beer at other places.  So it was a great deal.  We ordered a bunch of rolls, but i specifically remember these rolls.  The lollipop roll (which was fantastic and refreshing), the spicy salmon really packed a punch and was really delicious, I mean you find this roll at every restaurant but it was very satisfactory.  Finally the soft shell crab roll was both crunchy on the inside and well wrapped so it didn't fall apart.  Honestly, all the above reviews, aren't wrong, just these people don't know what a trendy restaurant looks like.  This is a great place for young people and the food is really reasonably priced.  If you're young and sexy, this is the restaurant for you.  If you're old and hip, this is the restaurant for you, if you're old and dumb, then don't eat at this place.  Just think about the restaurant name "Sake Bomber Sushi" does that sound kid friendly?  would you take your kid to a place called "Irish Car Bomb Potatos"?   I think this place was awesome, don't take my word for it, go check it out for yourself.  Went back to it when I was back in Phx, it was better than I remembered it.  Man, people are literally dumb, this is a cool place for cool people, if you ain't it, don't go and don't bring your kids and then complain about it... if you're looking for a good time, this is the place, Head Chef Eric always hooks me up.

revisted this place, and honestly... it was exactly what I was looking for.  A place to kick back with some friends and have some sushi instead of deep fried everything from other places.  The sushi was well rolled, the wait staff was friendly, the chefs interact with you and if they don't, it's probably cause they're concentrating on making sushi haha.  I like how people show up at restaurants at 945 when they close at 10 and then B about it... get a life, cause obviously the chefs and their families have one.  And why are you watching monkeys masturbate anyways... sick nasty, get a life.  Eat at Sake Bombers more and maybe the chefs will invite you to chill after work.

One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, "hey wow, this is kinda cool" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had "cottage cheese" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us "you either pay or i come over the counter" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.    Also, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied.
