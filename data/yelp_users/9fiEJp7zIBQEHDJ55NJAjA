Saddle Ranch is awesome! I recently started coming here again because the staff is exceptional and are definitely on top of their game as far as being friendly and knowing how to tend bar! Our serve Alex B was great and concocted some amazing shots for us. I enjoyed his level of service so much that I recently had my birthday at the private upstairs bar and was blown away that saddle ranch gave us free champagne to celebrate! This is now my go to bar in old town!

Do not ever go here. They do not care about service, they only care about getting shutdown. AVOID!!!!!

We ordered food 20 minutes after we got here....still no food, on a Tuesday, gwith 20% occupancy!!! Don't get me wrong, they definitely deliver on the "cocktail" portion of their name, but not the "kitchen." The servers are attending but are idiots/could give a rats ass! They are as forgetful as they are stupid! Definitely fun if you're hammered and cannot notice but otherwise go home for better service and cheaper drinks!

Great local Asian food in old town that doesn't cost a ton and has great portions for price!   Staff was very friendly and accommodating! Try the candy chicken bowl w jasmine rice! It has a lot of chicken and just the right amount of sauce!   I will definitely be returning and trying the coconut water...in a coconut!
