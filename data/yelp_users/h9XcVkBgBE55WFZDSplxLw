This place is 5 stars all the way! The people that work here go out of there way to make you feel comfortable. My dad always worked on my car growing up but since I moved out of state,  I had to find someone I trust. That's not easy to do! These guys made me feel like I wasn't being ripped off, which seems to happen a lot since I know nothing about cars. Such trust worthy people. I am so happy I found this place.

Worst place in town! The staff was rude and unprofessional. Miguel "the manager" had a serious power trip. I will not be recommending this place to anyone in the future.
