Don't let this place fool you!   Picked up Gyro for lunch.....excellent. George, the owner, was super welcoming, the gyro and salad was delicious and more importantly left me full!   Will definitely be back for dinner sometime.

I'll keep this brief as I hope they can make improvements and I can write a better review later but here it goes.....  First time here was awesome....shoot first week here was awesome! Five Stars all the way, think I made it in 5 nights the first week. Atmosphere is unlike any other place, food was good, amazing beer on draft, I was a huge advocate and recommended it to everyone, which now is quite embarrassing.  With so much potential its sad to see a place like this go down hill so quick. The last few times I've been in  everything has been absolutely miserable. Service is terrible, waiters seem confused, food and drink is sporadic on whats in stock and whats not....things are just all over in the place.....you can tell they are lacking in leadership and direction which I can see now as I hear they have parted ways with their GM.   And the jokes in the bathroom and tables are HILARIOUS...mom really enjoyed them.   Props to AJ (Ashley), Ethan, and Brandon....they rocked and are whats going to save this place.
