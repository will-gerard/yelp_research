Ughh so disappointed usually this place isn't too bad but after yesterday never again. $50 of delivery ordered and never to be heard of again. After promised an hour wait at the most, with 2 hours passed and closing time approaching, we tried contacting them several times only to be directed to voice mail each time. At this point almost 10pm (closing time), starving, and not willing to be dismissed, my husband drove to Rosatis 10 minutes prior to closing time to see what happened. He walks in to find 2 employees chatting and hanging out. They claimed they were "swamped". No offer to discount/comp anything, or sincere apology. Mediocre food. Definitely not worth it and will never be providing our business to Rosatis again!!

Excellent service!! Mr B's was available when others were not over Memorial Day weekend! Great price for bouncy, generator and snowcone machine. Professional, efficient, and affordable! I appreciated the communication and timeliness- could not have asked for a better experience! Thank you Chad for making our experience unforgettable!
