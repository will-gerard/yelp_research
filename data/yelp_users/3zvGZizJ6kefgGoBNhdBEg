This pace is great. Did I say this place is great? Well great is an understatement. This place is AMAZING. Some of the best Chinese food in the valley I would have to say. The service here has always been fantastic every time my boyfriend and I have gone. They really have a knack for making you feel welcome and at home. They love customers with a good humor as well. The place itself is very cozy! it is always impeccably clean as well. It has a stand alone building location with it's own parking.   Now to get to the food..... Suffice to say, my mouth waters just thinking of this place. I absolutely LOVE it. The food is fantastic and the staff is so nice, they let me try as many things as I can turned vegetarian. I have never had an issue with getting sick from cross contamination. This place is SO vegetarian friendly. I personally recommend the Home Style Tofu (I believe that is what it is called, I'm not always the best with names but that should at least be close.).  My boyfriend has tried many of their meat dishes and gives them an A+ rating. This place is great for if you have mixed groups for dietary needs.   I recommend it to anyone wanting to have awesome food and friendly service. I love it here!

She wiped her nose with her hand and then scooped the ice cream....  SHE WIPED HER NOSE WITH HER HAND AND THEN SCOOPED THE ICE CREAM!  WHY DID YOU DO IT RAYNA?! WHY?!   That's dang nasty Rayna! You should know better if you have your food handlers card! Why Rayna, why?!  Thank goodness we were only getting an ice cream cake.

I would just like to say that Eva and Keaton are some of the nicest cashiers we ever have had. Even if they have a line, I prefer to wait in it versus go to another cash register because they give good service.

One of my favorite places to eat in the world! We have been going here for over 20 years and it's food is as amazing as it gets! The service is wonderful, the owners and staff are basically like family to us now.   The food is to die for. If you want a good place to eat, especially for nice dinners such as birthdays, New Years, graduations, etc., this is the place to go. I recommend trying the tomato soup as well. It's amazing.

So I'm a cosplayer and when I walked into this place, I had to say I had a nerdgasm.  There are so many costumes here, from the conventional Halloween ones up to higher quality ones for those who want to be more dressed up to stuff that I feel you could wear to the ren faire!   Costumes is not all they have though, oh no. Let's talk about things that are sometimes difficult to come by... Props. There were so many props everywhere it was amazing! They also had a giant array of wigs to choose from! This is great for first time cosplayers or people who want to dress up and do not get their wigs specially made.   They also have a giant array of body paints and makeup, which is what we were primarily there for. We got great customer service while trying to select the best brands.   Now here was the biggest thing of all... Something I have not even been able to find online.... Purple opera gloves.... Bam.

My mother decided to go here with coworkers for their lunch break because the food is diverse and can suit all their dietary needs, such as gluten free, corn free, and vegetarian. This used to be a place they went to often to eat a good meal. Too bad for the owners, they have lost the business of a large department of regular customers.   Why is this do you ask? Well the story is a very dramatic one that does not reflect kindly on the owners of this little joint. Looking at the other reviews on this page, I would say that many other customers have received the same kind of treatment.   The owner was atrocious. I'm sorry, but if you're going to be in an industry where you serve food and you have earned a reputation, chances are you're going to get a lot of customers. If you cannot handle that, you should probably close shop or hire staff to help out in the establishment.   Today, the owner decided to tell my mother that they were not able to serve a party of 6 or more, and if they ever wanted that, it was required that they call 24 hours in advance. No where, not on the web page or in person, is this policy displayed. It is entirely new to our knowledge. Not to mention, they were not a party, instead they were a group of coworkers who happened to go to the same place at the same time. Coincidence? Not particularly when your place of work is close by.   Two of her coworkers were taken aback by how the owner nastily told them about this policy and decided immediately to eat elsewhere. My mother and the last three coworkers were hungry and wanted to eat immediately. Upon seeing that they were staying, the owner decided to tell them that since it was only her husband in the kitchen, the food was going to be served very slowly. It was almost as if she did not want them as customers and was trying to get them to leave.   They decided to order anyway, there was not much time to go elsewhere after the nice long discussion with the owner. My mom was the last to order, and upon receiving the change back from her purchase, the owner decided to rip into her. She explained once more, nastily, their policy of parties. My mom explained, once again, they were not a party. They were coworkers that were coming in for lunch.   After this, while they were sitting at the table, the food for my mom was served first. She had to get a to go box because the service was so slow. She followed the owner back to the front to get a box, to which the owner decided she was hiring my mom without pay, and asked her to take the orders back to her coworkers. Strange thing to do when you're supposed to be the server. Couldn't even do her own job.   I don't recommend this place to anyone. My own personal experience was not good there when it was like the world was over when I didn't want cashews on my sandwich and preferred peanuts instead. They really need to work on their hospitality skills.

This place is really great! It is so nice being able to go somewhere as a vegetarian and not be concerned that I might get sick from the food and cross contamination. The food here is AMAZING. Some of the best out to eat vegan food I have ever had in my life! I love it!   I recommend practically everything on the menu. We all have our favorites, of course, but there is not a single thing on the menu that I have found distasteful.   The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere is nice. The music can be a bit loud sometimes but that is not a big deal, especially since there is an outside area which is nice during the non-summery times.   I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try it.

The food here is very good! While some of the waiters do need a little practice, the Chinese couple that runs this store are awesome. My boyfriend and I love coming here.  Also, it is vegetarian friendly. Big plus!

This place is fantastic! I recommend it to anyone who wants to eat something that is not inside the norm.  This place is very vegetarian friendly! It also has a few vegan options but you usually need to call in and put those on reserve earlier in the day or the day before you go (that's the only downfall).  The fries are also very good! I have always gotten good service as well. I highly recommend it.  My favorites are the TIkka Masala pasty and the Pesto "Chicken" (Both of these are vegetarian options so all the meat is soy meat)

This park is great.  I've been going here for two decades now and it's a very relaxing place to be.  I personally like cuddling up to the trees with a book but you can do much more than that.  There are plenty of playgrounds for young children and tons of fields to play sports in.  It's also a great place for picnics and weddings.  I have seen quite a few wedding parties there.   I personally like using the hills for ice block racing.  They are great!

Literally took ten minutes for them to make two drinks while business was slow. At least the drinks taste good.

I love this company! I have always been treated well here. The staff is nice and the food is good. It's very crowded, but the staff will work with you to find a place to sit and the food always comes quickly.   They are also very kind to vegetarians. I have not gotten sick from cross contamination here at all and they are great at separating. It is good for individuals and groups!   The music isn't blaring but nice and comfortable! The atmosphere is very nice. I recommend this place for sure! Their cheese ravioli is amazing as well as their Mediterranean salad!

I would not recommend this place to vegetarians. I've tried it more than once just to be sure, but even with their vegetarian options I get sick every time. There is not much in terms of their "vegetable" choices. All starch basically. Their food could also taste a little better. Basically it's the same meal, just different sauces.   The customer service was okay. I do appreciate how clean the place is though. They do a great job keeping the place from looking disgusting and they are one of the cleanest places I've been to for quick food. Their prices could be slightly lower for what they offer, especially since most of the meal is rice.   The music in the place is loud and that can get tiring, but if you sit outside or in a corner it is a little better.   I would recommend this place for people who eat meat and do not know the taste of authentic food from Thailand, China, Japan, etc. This will be the last time I go here, I'm tired of getting really sick.

I'm a pretty patient person,  but when you say my only choices for being sold a dress with a big hole in it is 15% back or a return, when I obviously want the dress,  it doesn't really sit well with me. 15%? Seriously? This product is damaged. He then said I could just go to another Ross. That's a good plan! I'm going to another Ross. I'm never going back to this one.   I think the worst part was he told me I could just patch it.  It was a hole that was in the front of the dress.  Yes,  I do know how to patch it,  but that's visible no matter what.  Also,  I should not have to fix clothes I just bought.   Ticks me off that I've had crappy service the few times I've come here but that just puts the icing on the cake. I'll definitely find another one to get deals.

This place will take forever no matter what.  I just got to wait one hour to buy one item.   No matter what time you come in it's at least a 30 mine wait.  Really not worth the time.  Go to the one that is a bit further from you and go there,  so much more worth it.   Even when you finally make it a decent way in a line there is always done sort of hold up.  They are never staffed enough and so much theft occurs here,  it's disgusting.  You can go through a clearance bin and half the items are missing from their cases.   Find another Walmart.  That is all. To top it all off,  just got home and one third of my product is damaged.  That's a waste of my money.

I love Asian markets. Why? Because I miss the food I ate while I was in China. Plus I like a lot of the snacks and such. They also have a good selection of fresh foods. As a vegetarian, I mainly shop produce so I can't tell you much about the meat or fish, but they do have fresh fish. As in still alive fish for those who want it.

Good place to have a relaxing workout and also a great place to bring your kids.  The age range for this place is huge. There are all sorts of activities that you can do here,  my personal favorite is racquetball.  If you want to play that prepare for a line.  It's always busy.   They have a small workout center that is nice but this place is much more family oriented

The food is okay,  not the best I've had,  but not the worst either.   Now on the service. .. I swear I left 5 years older it was so slow.  It's a good thing that we get our own water jar at the table because I swear we didn't have a waiter.  Only go here if you're prepared to wait a while

Can't say I ever plan to go here again. Not after today.   I'm sorry, but when an employee makes a rude, derogatory statement about me? That's just wrong. I don't care if it was under his breath towards his fellow coworker, I could hear him. It was incredibly rude and I never plan to give my service here again if they hire that kind of person.

It used to be this was a five star place to eat for me, it just seems I had not reviewed yet. Well, this is my review now. This place is no longer as great as it used to be sadly. Here's my reasoning as to why.  Yesterday we went to eat there in a large group of seven, this has never been an issue and wasn't last night. The issue began when I ordered Miso Ramen to be vegan, something that I have done for the past 2 years that we have been going to this place. Apparently now they put pork in the base, something I was just informed of last night. In addition, it seems that they put pork in all but the vegetarian and Shiso ramen. This was very disappointing not only to me, my family who also has vegetarian members, but also those in my group who cannot eat pork for religious purposes. Their udon dishes all have fish sauce, but that is nothing new.   The girl taking our order was kind enough to inform us of this, but ended up getting more and more irritated as we were trying to figure out what we could eat and what we wanted to do. We figured out what we could eat, ordered and sat down to wait. The food came and all was going well until my sister, one of the groups vegetarians, discovered meat in her food. She returned the bowl and explained why she needed a new one made.   The one who made the second bowl was a waitress that I have seen there for the past two years I have been going. She's a little below average height, dark hair, wears glasses and I believe her name is Karina. She's great. Always friendly with amazing customer service. She made up the second bowl and the rest of the night went smooth. That was until the waitress that took our order decided to complain about us, very visibly pointing at our table while she spoke. This girl would not give us her name, but she was short and the few times I have seen her she has worn a messy bun for her hair. She also has a poor attitude it seems. Pity.  Suffice to say we will not be returning after being long time regulars. It is a shame because we really did like this place. Unfortunately we do not appreciate poor customer service and getting sick off of the food because of "the necessity of pork/meat for flavor". I thank all the other waiters and waitresses who have been amazing to us over our time eating there. We will no longer be returning, but we hope that they will once more become a happier, more vegetarian friendly place again.

This place is AMAZING! The food is fantastic, some of the best I've had. The service is awesome as well. Very nice people run this restaurant. Basically, I eat so much I roll out of there like a beach ball. Well worth it, I want to try every dish.   The vegetarian dishes are fantastic! I have not once gotten sick there either (except for the times I've eaten too much food, of course.)   I give it an A++ and recommend everyone to go there! I have nothing more to say other than the food speaks for itself, so give it a try.

This place is fantastic.  I personally recommend the Buffalo wings and Wendy's Pickle.  We've been going to Green for a while and we have never had issues. Great food,  casual atmosphere,  and great service.  Delicious food.  Something to note is that they are closed on Sundays,  unless that has changed.  If so,  please let me know.

Sadly this place has gone downhill.  It used to be great,  really high quality food.  The quality has sadly lowered. I don't know if they changed the oil they use,  it seems like they have, but it definitely is not being heated up enough changed or not.  The fries are no longer crispy,  the fake chicken was slipping out of its breading and it was extremely greasy. This has been over the last five times we have gone so it seems to be a permanent change at both locations.  My family and I are sad regulars who will no longer be returning and we have been going since the store opened.  Bye bye Green :( it was a good run while the food was still amazing.

The customer service was not really up to par. I was the only person there and it still was slow service to be called back and to wait on the doctor.  The doctor was nice and helpful, he was the saving grace of the visit and why I did not put two starts.  The bad part was when I needed blood drawn. I told the first nurse the specifications I needed for getting my blood drawn, as I know what I need from having my blood drawn over 50 times. She wanted someone more advanced to do it, and that was fine.  What was not fine was that I heard them all talking and seemingly arguing on who was going to draw my blood.  Finally, after one nurse was decided on, I told them once again I needed a butterfly needle because I have tiny veins. She used a regular needle and now I get to deal with a punctured vein that is currently leaking. I can't say I'm quite pleased at this. In fact, there have been lawsuits over this kind of thing before if I recall correctly.  I only hope that I don't have billing issues like I have seen in Google reviews, because the last thing I want to do is have to sit on the phone for hours fixing an ordeal. If I have issues, I will surely update this review and change my rating to 1.  So far, no problems other than poor service and not being listened to about my own veins.

If you're a vegetarian, do not eat here. The tofu tasted like charcoal and the rest of the ingredients in the bowl were bland. It was probably one of the worst meals I've had in a long time.   We ordered spring rolls with tofu and they gave us chicken and then complained about the fact that we had to send it back and they had to remake it. The staff made fun of us in the back for the whole duration of our meal. One of my favorite lines was "I'm tired of having to remake things for vegetarians." I'm sorry, but if you offer vegetarian options, you better not complain when you screw up.  The only plus side to this was the manager. She was very nice and personable though we had to get her ourselves because the waitresses refused to do so.   When vegetarian options are added, the staff should expect to serve many vegetarian customers and should be professional about it, not making fun of us to where we can hear it. They further complained after one waitress spilled water all over us and some of the food when we asked for replacement bowls.   This place is bad, not worth the money or time. It made everyone in my group sick, even those that eat meat, and is an overall horrible place.

I see Dr. Kohli and Dr. Green who are both doctors that work for this company. They do change offices around a lot though, so they might not always be at this location.  I have to say that these two doctors are the most reassuring I have ever had. It's scary when you're in your 20's and you are told that you have two heart conditions. Not only did they understand my fears, they comforted me and told me every single fact that I wanted to know about my conditions, including the difficult ones such as if it was life threatening or not. (Luckily neither of them shorten my life span, they are just very annoying!)  The staff here is amazing. I am always treated very kindly every time I come here, no matter if it is for a doctor's visit or a stress test. They are amazing in every way and I deeply appreciate how kind they are.  They especially showed this when another patient was harassing me because he was sitting down and I stepped in line. He began to harass me saying I cut him. So sorry that I cut you while you were not even in line Mr. Grumpy. Not only did they reassure me that I was fine, they handled that awful patient very well.   I will continue to go to this clinic as long as I live in Phoenix, I do not care how far I have to drive. They are worth it. I recommend them to anyone who is going through heart issues or has family members going through heart issues. These doctors know what they are doing.
