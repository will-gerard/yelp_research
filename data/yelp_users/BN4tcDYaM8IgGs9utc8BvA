So last Friday 4/29 I went to this location. It was my first time here at this location. I got my lip and eyebrows done. I had a wonderful experience as far as friendliness and I thought the girl had done a good job. So much so that I signed up for a wax pass. I looked over the fact that instead of plucking shorter hairs she continued to go over the same areas several times with wax. And applied it while it was still quite hot. Friday I looked good, just had a sore lip. Saturday I started breaking out on my lip and eyebrows, and it felt like I had sun burn and the breakouts have continued. I have embarrassing pimples all over my upper lip and eyebrow area.   I have contacted the facility by email to request cancellation of my wax pass and was told I would hear from someone in 1-3 days. It's been three days. no word yet. After this experience I will NEVER go to European wax center again.

I want to note I did get a refund on my wax pass, and on the services I had for that day but only for my lip. Unfortunately for me I suffer with acne and when I have a break out I scar. I now have several scars on my upper lip and my eye brow areas. I am so devastated by this. My skin was just starting to clear up and these will take weeks to fade....

Had Sunday brunch here with a friend. Cute atmosphere, dj was kinda wack but I could live with it. Food was bomb, service was good. Wish there was more parking but what can you do?!

Service wasn't awesome, it's an order on your own at the food truck or bar and pick up your own order. No waiters or waitresses. But the vibe is awesome. Nice mix of people. Awesome music (old school 90s, 80s,70s, etc). Karaoke was super fun. All in all a great time. Also the drinks are awesome :-)

I have been craving cheesesteaks and being from the east coast it's hard to find a good one. My mom and I decided to try this place today. Great!!! And I will be back. First of all the staff was great, William thank you for you're great customer service! And the cheesesteaks were amazing. Meat well seasoned, hot, and super cheesy. Needless to say this will be my new cheese steak spot!!! Hooray!!!!

Not very satisfied. Went in for an oil change. Was told that I needed new tires, a wheel alignment at the start. Advised I wanted to check with my father about payment for those extras (500+)more, and felt very pressured. At the end was told I needed a fuel injector flush and two of my lights were out. I know how to change lights on my own and declined the flush. When I went to the autoparts store to get light bulbs right after my oil change none of my lights needed to be replaced. I will not be returning here. I also need to add that there was no sticker put in my car or on my invoice to let me know what date or at how many miles I would need my next oil change. Unacceptable

Myself and two friends went here last Saturday to check out this spot. We had planned to come here for my birthday in June with a huge group of people. We started on the back patio, because there were no seats in the front and we are smokers. No complaints the back patio is private and the waitress we had was attentive and awesome. We moved up front so we could people watch and that's when the experience turned sour. I have nothing poor to say about the food. It was great. Bruschetta was great, I had chicken parmesan and despite the chicken being a tad bit burnt and the pasta not all the way cooked it was good. my friends had a burger, and meat balls and they loved it. The problem was the service. the hostesses and waitresses all huddle at the front and hang out, super unprofessional. We asked one waitress to please get our server so we could order more drinks before happy hour was over (she hadn't checked on us in about 20 minutes), and she looked at us like we were crazy. And then was super rude about getting our waitress, instead of just politely taking our order and giving that tab to our waitress. After the experience we said no way to coming here for my birthday, the service just wasn't worth the atmosphere or food. I was really disappointed.

Went for breakfast Saturday. Pretty busy, however also super slow. It was me and two others. We ordered two omelets and an egg breakfast. Waited almost 30 minutes for our food. Our waitress never came back to see if we wanted more coffee or water or anything until we complained about not getting our food yet.  The food was sub-par. Luke warm when we got it. Not seasoned well. I probably won't come back. I can see why restaurants like snooze are taking over business.  Definitely need work on service.

This is a great mexican restaurant. The tacos are amazing, the rice and beans are some of the best i have ever had. And the salsa was outstanding. I had the hottest red salsa and it added great flavor to my chicken tacos. I am quite impressed with this food and will return again and bring everyone I know!!  *HIGHLEY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT*

I love coming here to get my nails done. I see Jade and she always does any design I ask for. She is so nice and kind. As well the rest of the staff is awesome and very accommodating.  Whether you have an appointment or not, they always fit you in, and do a great job.  Ask for water or even mimosas  Best place in town to get your nails done!!!!!!

I hate to have to write such a poor review. My friends and I were on a group birthday trip for all of us and decided to treat ourselves to an awesome meal. Based on reviews we thought this restaurant would be great. We were wrong. We expected to pay high prices and that everything would be a la cart. What we did not expect is that the quality of the food would be so low. I got a moscow mule to drink and it was horrible. Not made the correct way at all, you couldn't taste any ginger beer it tasted like sprite. When we ordered I got filet Mignon, medium rare. My friend got the braised short ribs, and my other friend got the rib eye There aren't many choices on the menu and all of the cuts of meat are huge.  My steak was cooked OK, but the center was cold, and it lacked seasoning. The short ribs were mostly fat. My friend was digging to find actual meat. Her plate was filled with grease when she was done. And she probably got about a cup and a half worth of meat in total. The rib eye was cooked OK, but lacked flavor. All of the meat lacked flavor honestly. Ruth Chris costs less and tastes better. Needless to say we were dissapointed. Our waiter didn't even ask us once how our meal was, or if we were doing OK so we could complain to him (ours had an eye patch). I would NEVER return here or recommend it to ANYONE. It's not at all worth the $80 each you will spend. Try somewhere else.

Me giving one star is gracious. My roommate and I went here tonight. I have been to this restaurant when it was just the sushi room and loved it! However tonight was different. I made a reservation for 630, the hostess asked us to sit at the bar while they prepared the table,and then sat 12 other people at the table before she remembered the two of us. When we sat down we ordered, the waitress took forever to bring the soup which was Luke warm at best and tasted like soapy dish water. The salad didn't come until the chef started making our food. This was good. But as everyone was receiving their fried rice and steamed rice,my roommate and I noticed we had not gotten our steamed rice. We had to ask another waiter for rice. I had new York steak and shrimp. My roomie had chicken and filet mignon. My steak was over cooked I asked for medium rare. Her chicken as well was over cooked. Neither were seasoned barely at all. The shrimp was good tho. Unfortunately after I saw the owner ask a table full of people who were done eating and chatting if they could please move because while they appreciate their business there were people waiting. I knew my complaints would be irrelevant. Needless to say I'm disappointed in the food, the service, all of it. And will never go back for tempanyaki. They have alot of kinks to work out.
