I really like this place for lunch. I have had the Reuben and Meatloaf sandwiches. They both were excellent. Good Cole slaw as well.  The service is friendly and very efficient.  It is located in an industrial and has somewhat limited parking in their lot but the side streets help out in that case.  Lots of down home food done pretty well. Check it out!

We like this theater.  It is clean and the kids who work here are always nice. We have never had issues with picture or sound quality.

Pizza muffins are what brings us here.  They are awesome.  Good salads and great service as well.  Atmosphere is cozy and relaxed.  Good for families.

Love this place. I love the drinks, atmosphere, and the service.  Barristas are always upbeat and friendly.  Great offers on bulk coffee. They have Italian sodas too! Kids love them.

Great lunch with family.  Miso soups and sushi for most.  Roast beef sandwich for one kid and chicken fingers for another.  Great service.  Very warm and friendly.  Server was Grey.  Ask for him.

Not a great place. I do not mind old rundown places but you could smell the fresh urinal cake.  Went for lunch on a Wednesday and only two other people in there. Owner took order at register which was fine but he didn't seem to be into the whole thing,  older gentleman brought drinks and food.  I think he washed dishes too.  Tacos were greasy and food was so so at best. My boss ordered a carne asada chimi that was full of greasy, old, and fatty pork.  Just not a good experience.  I think they worry about the bar business at night.  The older gentleman was very kind and courteous though.

Best experience that I have had in a vet office. Staff is kind and knowledgeable and Dr. Burke is warm and informative. He lets you know about all choices you have and is fairly priced. I had tried other vets when our dog had a growth on his abdomen. We were given all kinds of alarming information and were pushed to operate right away. Dr. Burke took the information and let us know what the outcomes could be. We ended up getting the operation with him and  our Riley is doing great.   This is the place to take your pets!!

This place is not bad.  A bit old and roughed up as far as decor.  Staff was nice and pretty efficient. I got the burger salad which was acceptable. Not bad but not great.  Fries were what you would expect.  Again, not the best but not the worst.  It is better than fast food.

Great food, good prices.  We love to come as a family. Pizza and hot sammies are the best.

I eat meat but love this place.  I have had the faux chicken sandwich--- it is awesome. I also have had the Thai curry bowl--- very, very good. Another item you MUST try is their berry punch or lemonade. They are freakin' awesome.   Service is friendly and everyone is very cool and laid back. It must be that they do not eat meat which makes you somewhat irritable and violent?!?!  LOL.  Get a friend who thinks vegan food is dumb or nasty and take them with you. Chances are, you will open their eyes.  I recommend this place wholeheartedly.

Great homemade french bread does the job.  The sandwiches are really great. Fresh bread and good meat.  Better than subway or other similar places.    They only take cash but the low prices are worth the hassle.

I have been a fan of Changing hands for about 7 years now.  The staff is helpful and open to conversation. The have a great variety of books and also carry a lot of used copies of McSweeneys which I really enjoy.  I love the atmosphere and the good deals on used books.  I do like the idea of supporting local businesses as well.

I really enjoyed the buffet lunch.  Fresh salad and pasta/meat dishes. Simple but done well.  Great value at 9 bucks that includes a drink.   Very cozy and clean atmosphere with a great staff. Owner is great as well.  I will be taking wife back for dinner as the wine selection looks solid.  Give this place a try.

Family owned and run, we simply love this place.  Mom and daughter run Gilbert location and are awesome.  Great atmosphere for family.     Food is wonderful.  We eat in or take out and it has NEVER disappointed.  We have tried the kabob, shwarma, and kafta plates mostly.  Hummus is solid as well. You cannot go wrong here.  One of our all time favorites.

We get the Philadelphia and crunchy California rolls mostly as they are reasonably priced. We have had the Boston and Las Vegas rolls as well.  You really cannot go wrong here, the happy hour prices are really great as well.  Service is always on point and friendly.  The place is small and cozy.  It is a solid go to for us.

Cheap books and everything else. You also get to check out people out so that is a plus.  Staff is fun and helpful and adding the cafe was a great call.  I still love Changing Hands but Bookmans is on their heels.

Was at this campus for a LinkedIn event. It was adequate. Building is dated and has that feel. Computer lab was fine but somewhat confining.  The event itself was great though!

Place seems to be going downhill. It is close to my house and next to my Safeway so our girls like it from time to time. Food has become somewhat greasy and the interior is cluttered.    The owners need to take a close look at this place through a customer's eye. I think they might not like what they see!  In need of cleaning the place up and getting back to preparing the food the way they used to.

Damn!  I have had it twice. It gets better each time.  Great sauce and crust.  Sausage and onion was the way to go.  Good hot and fresh, cold, or reheated the next day.  One of the best in Phoenix easily.

I had the crab cakes which were wonderful.  I will be back.  Great atmosphere but go when you have some time. The food is made fresh so it takes a bit longer but so worth it. Our server was wonderful and made several recommendations depending on different tastes.

Great place for pizza and calzones. All pizzas are great but the white is the best. Get the riccota on it as well.  Sign up foe the club and get a free pizza on your bday. It is a deal!!

Ok, I do not see what all the hoopla is about.  The burger was better than fast food but inferior to Smash or Five Guys.  I was not impressed at all. Went during a normal lunch hour and service was average. Not bad, just normal.  Again, not a fan of this place, hard to understand what the deal is with this one.

I really enjoyed the Russian potato salad as well as the potato and farmer's cheese pierogi.   The cabbage roll was really awesome. Juicy and moist. The place is small but clean.  Dining room is somewhat cramped but colorful.  They do sell a a large number of goods to make at home as well.  I will be back to try other dishes.  Give this place a shot.

Awesome food. Just like the food I had in Piura years ago.  Wife had Saltado de Mariscos and I had the Lomo. Both were fantastic.  Try the papas a la huacaina, they are remarkable.

It is what it is.  Not bad but not great. I have had the burritos and flautas which are passable and will work in a jam.  Wife likes the place and kids eat for a buck on Sundays.    It is ok.

I like the Bistro for what it is. It is a much better workplace cafe than others that I have experienced.  Bfast burritos are a solid choice. They have Thursday Chef's Table specials that are usually very good. Prices are fair and Gaston, Cindy, and Yadira give great customer service.   They should offer bfast pizzas every day, though!

This place is the real deal.  I really enjoyed the schnitzel and the potato salads.  The cabbage rolls were good but I have had better. We ate the lunch buffet so I think if you order them as an entree, they would rock.  People are friendly and the service is good.    Everyone should try this place at least once.  We will be back to sample other fare.  They have Poutine from Canada!!!

Probably the best pizza that I have ever had. I keep it simple, a bit of cheese, sauce, and some olives.  This place is legit!  Cool atmosphere, great owner.   Remember, good food takes a minute so do not expect to get your meal fast. It takes time to make it fresh and cook it the way you are supposed to.  It is pricey but worth it. Come one man, this aint Pizza Hut!!!  Go try this place and you will thank me!

Oh hell yes!  I was exposed to empanadas during my time in Chile.  This place is a godsend.  Cool locale, nice people, and great sangria and food.  We have had almost all flavors on the savory side and they are all very good.  They cheeseburger flavor was a wonderful surprise.  This place is a must!

Yes, the hype is true. Best bbq that I have had.  Brisket is amazing and melts in your mouth.  Pork ribs were juicy and full of meat.  The sides were jalapeno grits and baked beans.  They were both up to snuff as well.  Get there as soon as you can but be ready for a wait.  It is worth it though.

I was very impressed. I had the Tide Roast which was simply amazing.  Great portion size and the flavor was really, really great.  Wife had halibut and beet puree.  She loved it as well.  It is busy and a bit noisy on weekends so we sat at a hightop in the bar area. Just fine. If you do not want to wait, this works well.   Going back for Louisiana Gumbo next!!

We got takeout from here for the first time today.  We loved it. Very fresh and great service. We had the Tom ka soup with yellow curry chicken. Great flavor and again, very fresh.  This is our new spot.
