ABSOLUTELY THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! I understand that I came in 30 min prior to close but they just ignored while taking 2 other ppl before me!!  To think I'm gonna spend that much money for such crappy service u think not... Ppl just don't know I will write a complaint on the better business bureau website with the quickness!!!! Actually 1 star is too much!

I went yesterday. Have to say this place has the worst food ever!! When asked about a refund they stated they do lot do refunds. The roll was a typical Philly, not sure how hard that is. They have us credit however there is nothing at this place I would eat. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!
