Service was good & friendly. Food was great! Chicken Picata was excellent; can't go wrong with capers. The Gnocchi with Rosati was was absolutely perfect. The Italian Meatloaf was a culinary delight, especially with the Gorgonzola Sauce (it's not too sharp - on the mild side). AND get a Potato Ball! They are infamous indeed. Will definitely come again!

Great place, good food, good atmosphere. It's on the loud side. So it's not the place to go for conversation if you don't feel like yelling at each other. There's a fantastic patio with fire place and twinkle lights. Yum yum!

Nice laid back atmosphere, friendly staff and yummy veggie rolls. Get them tempura fried and you'll be in heaven.  Love sitting at the bar and chatting with the sushi chefs.  :)

I ordered a pizza from this restaurant last week, and it was...meh. I don't exactly know what was wrong with it, but I didn't like it.

Yum yum! I LOVE their BYOB (Build Your Own Burger)! It's not listed on the form, but you can get it with their homemade veggie burger pattie, which is fantastic. Their spicy cottage cheese is awesome too.  The staff are always friendly and the restaurant decor and atmosphere is great. If you're into sports (I'm not but I still like the place) they have a gazillion giant flat screen tvs throughout. Trivia night on Tuesday is a lot of fun too.  I gave them 4 out of 5 stars because of their cocktails. On two separate occasions I have ordered two different drinks, and both times they were extremely weak and watered down. Don't go for the cocktails. But the beer, food, friendly staff and atmosphere keep me coming back over and over again.

Wow - So, this is my first negative review on Yelp...   First of all, I don't care how fancy a Mexican restaurant is, the chips and salsa should be free. $4.00 for salsa and chips is ridiculous, especially when they're not bottomless.  And second, the service was awful. The waitress hardly knew anything about the menu, the restaurant that she has worked at for the past 10 months. The waitress also came to the table every couple minutes, interrupting our conversation and asking stupid questions, ie "are you done with your meal?" as I was putting food in my mouth.   We were 1 of 2 tables in the whole restaurant that were occupued and they screwed up my order. Not only did they bring me the wrong dish, once they realized it, they told me that the dish I ordered is no longer offered, yet it is still on the menu. I had to wait several minutes for my correct order while the rest of my party at their meal. And then I ate my meal with everyone watching me. Afterwards I was only compensated $4 on the bill.   On the plus side, the food was good, the ambiance and music were good...However I will most likely never go back to this restaurant again.

Super delicious neighborhood nosh!  I can walk here and it's so so good. Great music & atmosphere.  Laid back, friendly staff.   I always get the Albacore Salad even though it's not on the menu anymore, and it's so so good. My boyfriend swears by their Margarita Pizza, saying it's the BEST pizza in the valley. I definitely recommend Nook to anyone looking for a new restaurant to try. Yum yum, go here!!!
