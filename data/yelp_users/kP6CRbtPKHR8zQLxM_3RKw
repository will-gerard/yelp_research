This place was the place i always went to to get my clothes altered. She always did a great job until the last 2 times I went in. She was supposed to hem a tank top and when I came to pick it up she hadn't altered it at all.   Then I came to a get a dress taken in and hemmed and all she did was hem the dress and left the safety pin in from where she was supposed to take in.   She is not open on Sundays and closes at 5:30 so it is extremely hard for me to get there after work. I picked up my dress on the way to an event so I did not get to check it to make sure it was ok until Sunday. Saturday is literally the only day I can make it to her store and now I have to wait till next week to bring it back in to get it fixed when it should have been done last week.

I love this place! My boyfriend and I come here all the time and the owner always remembers us. The food is amazing with great service and a reasonable price! The falafels are made the order and the lamb melts in your mouth. Amazing Mediterranean food!

The first time I came I got a free giant cookie with my meal and this time I got free chocolate covered strawberries! The food is great and service is great too!
