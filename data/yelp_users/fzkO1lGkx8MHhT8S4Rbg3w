Had the Green Chile Burro Enchilada Style, with Green sauce - as recommended. La Bomba. I am going to try to frequent this place in the future. I enjoyed the experience. Plenty of customers from all walks of life; Businessmen, families, etc. When I came up to the counter, I was greeted by some very friendly and upbeat employees, and when I asked "what's good here?" they replied "the service!". I totally agree. About $20 for two to eat your fill, and have a nice relaxing lunch on the patio at the benches. Even the hot-ass 103F plus sun didn't seem to faze me until I was walking back to the car... A PHX favorite. Who says we don't have culture in the Valley??? Oh yeah, CASH ONLY - NO ATM. Grab a $20 at the Circle K around the block.

I was driving around the North Phoenix area around 8 and started feeling hungry. I passed the Streets of New York, and made a quick turn to dive into their parking lot and decided to give it a shot. The place is medium sized and pretty casual, with TVs playing sports situated around the room. This is a good place to go for a pizza party with your baseball team. I ended up getting a large Pepperoni with black olives, and a chopped antipasto salad. It turned out the be a great choice. The pizza was great. New York style, etc. The best aspect was probably the salad. Really great. The waitress was attentive, but not of the highest quality. It was a fun atmosphere and I'd definitely go back soon. SONY is now my favorite pizza joint in the valley. (I have only tried Papa John's, Pizza Hut, and Peter Piper's so far).

I love non-chain restaurants to begin with, and this place exemplifies the attention to detail and wholly pulled-together ambiance that a great one-off place could be. I went with my Dad, who was in town for the day. Bonus points for having a few plasmas playing the ballgame, but not too many. Classy and understated all the way. New Mexico themed fare, whatever that is. It is basically a seafood/steakhouse with a bit of extra spicy kick to everything. I went with the Pasta and Grill, which consisted of a small medallion of steak, some chicken (with the added kick) and swordfish with a spicy chutney over the top. Served over beans and rice, with half the plate offering up some pretty damned tasty penne. Went great with a glass of wine, and not too much damage on the wallet. We got out of there for $60 plus a tip. One of my new favorites. Interesting note; my Dad said if I didn't pull him in here, he would have "driven right by the place and not even knew it was there". On the way out, a busboy stopped my Dad and asked "do I know you from somewhere?" My Dad said he was the guy from the KYOT voice overs, and gave his best "Kay-why-oooooh-teeeeee". Nice.

I was headed to TeePee, but at the last moment had a change of heart. I decided to go for a new Italian place, and this small restaurant caught my eye. Very small dining room, with nice tables positioned so you can sit close to your date. I had the prosciutto and melon, which came served as a single slice of Cantaloupe sitting on a bed of prosciutto. It was OK, but I was not a fan of the presentation. For my entree I had the Veal Parm, and it was sub-par. It felt like a chicken fried steak. The wine selection was nice, but not anything noteworthy. I noticed three servers, only one of which actually fielding questions, the other two in charge of bread and busing only. I would have preferred a darker, more intimate atmosphere, but it was not bad. The bill for two came to approx $80. I don't think I'll be back, there are too many spots to check out before this place deserves a second visit. Nice if this is your neighborhood Italian spot for a mid-week meal.

This was the first time I had been to a Red Lobster in my life, and from what I have heard, they were like a seafood-centric version of Sizzler. Not in the least.. I must say I had a nice time here from the beginning to end. The server was courteous and prompt, the appetizer bread was surprisingly good, and the entrees were very tasty. I had the Surf and Turf, expecting the steak to be sub-par. I love steak, and this was excellent steak. Perfectly cooked and coupled with Lobster tails (2). I don't really dig on seafood, so this is a place I won't be frequenting, but I highly recommend and would gladly come back. I actually "sent my regards to the chef", like a dork...

As far as a pure golf spot, you must try Troon North. This place is a great change of pace. I actually had lunch and kicked it by the pool afterward, too. Places like this really make me appreciate the "world class" golf that North Scottsdale has to offer. This is to golf what North Shore is to surfers.

The best aspect of TCF is the ambiance. The interior of the restaurant is an Egyptian theme (I don't see the connection) and it is perfectly lit and outfitted for a dining experience. The food is so-so, with reasonable prices. The cuisine is a mix of traditional and American. I enjoyed our waiter, who seemed to be a Marketing major at ASU by the way his conversation with us led. I enjoyed myself during the dinner, and obviously loved the cheesecake afterward. I'll be back, but I'm not sure when. It's a bit out of the way from my neighborhood, and the area has a lot of options. I think Mastro's is next....

Went here for lunch and opened the place up at 11AM. It is a very casual spot, with very decent prices. Started off with the traditional chips and salsa. Chips were ordinary and the salsa was a bit watery for my taste. I had the Gollo burro. Very good. I don't know of too many places that serve this style, but I'm into it. The restaurant is located in the corner of a strip mall next to a fry's supermarket and behind the Jack-in-the-box. Inside, it's actually surprisingly spacious, and we had plenty of room in the booths. I'd go back, but there are way too many spots I have ranked higher that it may be a while. Decent, but not outstanding. Maybe I'm picky...

I love this place.  It's cash only, but there is an ATM. Once you walk in, the grill is usually cooking some hotdogs and the smell hits you right away. They have all sorts of incarnations of hotdogs and have a great selection of condiments and fixings to go on top. All the ingredients are top notch quality.  I usually go with the Bratwurst, but you can't really go wrong.  The onions and peppers are a great touch, with the sauce being the best part. I'm pretty sure they sell it by the bottle.  The same guy is working away at the grill everytime I've been, and he is definitely the best at grilling dogs I've witnessed.   *Mental note - Pick up a bottle next trip*

I gave it four stars, because for what it is supposed to do, it does well. I ALWAYS order a number one combo, white meat, large. If you are on a diet, this place doesn't make it seem so bad. I think I could probably live off this. I can't really contribute more, because I have never ventured outside the realm of the number one combo...... Sorry.

I am staying at a hotel on Indian School, and this place caught my eye. I know AZ has a fixation with Fry Bread, and felt like giving it a shot. A lady had a table set up, she was hawking jewelry and knick-nacks. Once inside, the atmosphere was like a traditional burrito place, but with a Native American flair to it. I ordered a Carne Asada taco and a "Chief" size soda. I helped myself to some complimentary water, and sat at the fast food-style benched table. The meat was great, and tasty, but the whole idea is the Fry Bread that it is served on. Pretty good, flaky, and huge portions. I would recommend for a lunch if you are in the area and feeling a bit adventurous.

The Orange Table is awesome! I loved the experience, from the location tucked away in the Scottsdale Mall, to the eclectic decor, to the cuisine and service. I walked up on a Saturday around 10AM, and was seated right away in a corner with drinks served promptly. The menu consists of Pancakes, Omelets, Hash brown-type entrees, and sandwiches. Everything was expertly cooked and I really enjoyed my Lemonade. Not too sugary, and not too Lemony. I'll definitely be back ASAP. This is my new pick for my favorite breakfast spot, and next trip will be to try to lunch menu.

Does it get any better? This has been an ASU/AZ institution since it's inception. Great for a quick dine and and/or liquid lunch, or the quick drive by to pick up a growler of kilt lifter. Definitely a conversation starter if you walk around the party with a growler of high gravity brew. I highly recommend taking the tour and checking out the brewing process, it's interesting to know that they strip down the water and add salt, etc, to the mix to get just the right tasting water; a crucial ingredient. They can simulate the water found in all the great beer-making locales around the world, from Dublin and back. This brew will make you homesick should you ever leave; ask my bro....

This is the best venue in the valley for what is intended to be; a midsize venue that attracts national touring acts, with a standing room only intimacy that you won't get at a place bigger or smaller. I saw Clutch here recently, and it rocked my balls off. I didn't drink at the place (took care of that before and after) so I can't comment on drink prices. Parking did suck, but there was a structure across the street for five bucks. One downside, going to the website to check out upcoming shows is tedious. The calendar is soooo hard to sort through, I would only go there to get more info on opening bands not listed on ticketmaster.com

Seriously, I just clicked on "two stars" and the description couldn't have said it better. "Meh. I've experienced better." I came here with my girlfriend at 8 on a Sunday night, and had a downright unpleasant experience. To sum it up; we waited for 45 mins, and then when I was seated I was told the deep dish would be an HOUR wait. WTF? I ordered the thin crust (which I hate) and got out of there in just under 2 hours. On the way out, I mentioned to the manager that they should really get thier act in gear and he told me, and I am quoting: "The good news is we are opening up many locations all over the valley to cut down on your wait time and better accommodate." Really? I'm going to Grimaldi's. Next time I want shitty fake Italian food I'll go to Olive Garden...

This is my pick for the best Mexican food in the valley. I've been coming here since I first came to PHX, in '98. The only caveat is that you must either be OK with sitting in a cramped booth or visit during off-peak hours. The chips and salsa are my "Best of the Valley". Plus, the faded steer leaning against a cactus logo is a fave. I actually rocked the shirt during college.

I really like this pizza joint. Great service and great pizza. I'll spare you the details, because Grimaldi's is reviewed to death, but this is one of my top spots in the whole valley.  http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/dining/articles/2009/08/18/20090818grimaldis.html  Cool article that goes to illustrate the lengths Grimaldi's goes to in order to make their pizza stand out from the pack.

I must admit, I'm more of a Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market guy (due to the economy), but I had a great time shopping at AJ's. Every single item on the shelves is of the highest quality. For Valentines day, because I'm so bad at picking out girly gifts, I let my girlfriend go on a shopping spree at the chocolate counter (among other things)...I'd go back once in a while, but did grimace at the checkout counter when I forked over $125 for three bags of crap...I guess it's back to mayonnaise sandwiches at Neighborhood Market.

I really liked checking a movie out here. It reminded me of younger, better days. We saw Inglorious Basterds here, and there was a movie showing at 11 on the same screen right after the completion, but I didn't plan to check it out also. Kinda tough to navigate through the chained together poles to make it to your destination, but once you do it is cozy. Dirt lot, so don't drive faster than 5 MPH or you'll kick up dust and disturb the neighbors. It's only six fifty per adult and you play the audio through your car radio. The downside to that is you have to keep your car running, or risk your battery dying. The best part of the experience is the privacy of being in your own car and doing private style things. I'm definitely going back. District 9 is next on the agenda.

I work fairly close to this location, and I'm happy I took a chance and drove past Subway. I stopped in and was greeted very pleasantly by the girl at the counter, and she helped me pick out the special of the day, the green chili tuna sandwich. It came with a pickle and chips/salsa. Everything was excellent and I really was impressed with the salsa. Also, I had my first FUZE drink with my meal, also recommended, and I loved it. I grabbed a to-go menu and will definetly try to make it back soon. Overall, it hit every item on what I judge a lunch spot by with flying colors. At first I thought the location was a bit out of the way, but I now view it as a destination, rather than a good meal while in the neighborhood.

Now this is what I'm talking about. After investigating the neighborhood a bit, I found my supermarket. It is located a bit down the road, but it is well worth the trek. It is a nice, new, clean, well lit and planned lot and store, adjacent to other cool shops. My initial reaction when I walked in the automatic sliding doors is that this is just like the Ralph's Fresh Fare market I frequented in Southern California. I found the aisles to be intuitive and user-friendly stocked, with good prices and fresh produce. The only thing that kept it from being a five-starrer would be that my phone number did not activate my Fry's club discount yet (it has been 4 days since I activated) and the checkout registers did not seem to be fully staffed, so there was a bit of a wait. Overall, a great place to pick up groceries.

This Fry's is the closest Grocery Store to my new apartment. I just moved in over the weekend, and went out exploring the neighborhood. I have been to a few Fry's grocery stores in the Tempe area before, and generally liked the stores, but this one felt inferior. I found the place to have a feel of the Ghetto Pavilions that I went to on occasion while I was still living in Long Beach. The aisles are narrow and dingy, with holes were product should be on the shelves. The main detraction is the cashiers. The young lady I had the misfortune of dealing with was rude and not helpful at all. Maybe it was that I was a bit more enthusiastic than the normal customer, but she seemed like she was having a bad day. She looked like she has had several bad days in a row, and her hair was messed up and her teeth were nasty. The courtesy clerk (I know the official title, because it was my first job as a kid) did not ask me what style bag I preferred, and stuffed everything in a single plastic bag, which he ripped. The carts all had bum wheels, and the parking lot was filthy. I'm not going back. Instead, I'll plan my grocery trips and head to the Basha's a few blocks from here.

Yay! I'm a fan. Four stars.  I don't think the location listed is actually the spot, it seems more to the north. I fell in love with Chick-Fil-A while going to ASU and living in the MU. My Maroon and Gold card got burnt up at the CFA there, and ever since I'll get in the mood for a run. This spot is off the 101 Loop, and when headed that way it makes it tough to pass by without swinging in the drive-thru. I just get the basic chicken sandwich. I don't care much for the extra stuff on the menu. This is kind of like the In-N-Out of chicken, for me....No Animal style, etc, that I am aware of though.

This is my pick for "best cup of coffee in the valley". I am not a huge coffee drinker, so take that with a grain of salt, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Usually I only drink coffee out of necessity. Also, I went here for lunch, and had the Californian Turkey sandwich. I though it was good, but nothing I couldn't pull together myself for half the price at home. A bag of jalapeno chips, eh....whatever. Great breakfast spot though, if you have some time to kill.

I love this place. I go here for everything that I can't pick up in bulk at Costco on Thomas and 44th. Very nice employees, always cheery and ready to help you out with anything. I am a fan of strolling the aisles without a list and just picking up things that look good. My impulse buy of the day: fresh Cevice and Guerrero's corn tortillas.

I guess I'm not the first one here.... I'm a fan. I was ready for a change of pace from the usual, and gave this place a shot. I am thoroughly impressed. Very, very small place, with only 20 patrons, tops, able to fit in here at once. The pizza oven is roaring away in plain sight from your table, and I think that added to the overall experience. All ingredients were fresh, with very nice serving plates and accoutrement. Our service was fantastic, probably because there was about one employee for every two patrons. My drink was refilled before it was empty, a plus, and the complimentary bread was delicious. We had a Caprese to start with a Margherita Pizza for dinner. Very traditional, very fresh, and now I consider this one of my go-to places. I'll be back soon. I don't recommend coming here with more than a party of four, tops, due to the size limitations. I hope they expand to a larger location, and bring all the same flavor with them....

Awesome! I went here on a very sunny Saturday morning, around 10AM. Upon driving up to the absolutely gorgeous Camelback Inn (not on Camelback Rd), I valet'ed the ride and walked in, and was seated right away. Had a great table by the fountain, and was luckily shaded by the umbrella from the ever-increasing AZ sunshine. The menu is not expansive, but I was able to decide on something I was looking forward to; the club sandwich 1/2 with small Caesar and Tortilla Soup. I got a lemonade to drink, and the lemonade ranks second only to the fantastic lemonade at The Orange Table. I really liked the presentation of the meal, with the three items served on the same rectangular plate. The service was excellent, and I couldn't help but be in a great mood. Kind of like when you are in a shitty mood and "Brown-Eyed Girl" by Van Morrison comes on the radio. As I walked back to the car and admired the beautiful view and landscaping of the Camelback Inn, I noted to myself that this would be a great place to take my Mom the next time she is in town. I started this review giving it four stars, but after writing this, I'm changing it to a fiver.

The last few months, it seems I went to get my car washed right before it would rain, without fail. I actually enjoy sitting in my car and going through the big blue tube. When I come out, I always am pleased with the shine. It does lack a bit of detail on the back end, especially where the trunk gate hides the dust. I ended up springing for the monthly pass of unlimited washes for $29.99. I'll make it a resolution to go at least once a week. Keep it clean.
