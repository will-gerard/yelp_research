If I could leave  less stars I would!!   I ordered two dozen roses and they wanted to charge me $50 extra to deliver them a mile away by 1PM, but they couldn't guarantee they'll be there by 1PM, but by 3PM instead even though they said by paying the extra $50, I'd be guaranteed delivery by 1PM. After ordering $180 worth of flowers, you'd think they'd be able to driver less than a mile away by 1PM when I ordered at 9:30AM. Don't waste your time.

Just moved into s new house, older, but newly remodeled home.  Been having some plumbing issues, tried a different plumber or two.  To no avail the same problem was not resolved.  As we are also a small business owners, and are fans of Yelp. After reading his reviews we called.  Freddy showed up took care of the our plumbing issue for a fair price. He was kind, friendly and very professional.. Highly recommended

Talked to Steve Yesterday  about  helping me with an existing system I wanted to upgrade at my Tempe business. He fit me in and came and saw me at my business today!  He reconfigured my system in a way I've wanted for a while!   He was very reasonable, and explained  everything in detail!   The products I bought were priced right and fair!   I would highly recommend his services. Actually going to have him do the security system at my house also!
