All I have had from here are their cupcakes.  Can we say heaven in my mouth?   Vendors visit my work and they like to feed us, I have had Main Course cupcakes twice now and they were superbly delicious.  All of my coworkers agree.  I have tried the red velvet, lemon, and boston cream (coworker and I shared so we could try more than one) and they were all noteworthy. My fav is the lemon.   I am interested to know what their other food is like, as I'm sure it is delish as well.

You know when a movie comes out and EVERYONE is talking about how great it is and when you finally see it you are extremely disappointed and wonder what all the fuss was about? That is what I half expected about Postinos.  Instead, this place EXCEEDED the already high expectations others had set in place for it.   I came here on a Friday evening a couple of weeks ago after a wine tasting at LGO. It was 6:30-7:00pm and we only waited a couple of minutes for a table.   It was just me and a girlfriend and since we have the same taste in wine, we decided to order a bottle to share.  We had the RIckshaw Pinot Noir which was delightful.  For food we had the Cheeseboard and the mozzarella and tomato jr.  AMAZING.  I love cheese (as do most wine lovers) and their cheeseboard was delicious.  It features a great variety of cheeses from mild to strong in flavor.    In my eyes the best combo of foods and flavors is the ever simplistic tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.  Postinos does it perfecto. Everything is fresh as fresh as can be, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  I had major food envy when I saw the table next to us get served an impressive plate of Bruschetta.  I will definitely be trying that the next time I come.   Here is how much I loved this place: I just found out my schedule is changing and I'll be getting off work at 3 instead of 5.  Literally the first thought that popped in my head was "I can make it to Postino's for their amazing happy hour!"   I literally can not wait to go back to this place.

Every couple of months I find myself here, usually when I want me time, meandering the racks of The Rack.  And every time I walk out with bag/s full of stuff I don't need, but love!  This is definitely one of my go to stores for clothes.  They carry some of my favorite brands at deeply discounted prices.  Hudson (is it me or is that denim magical? Puts the licious in booty!), Calvin Klein, Kische, and last but not least they carry Betsy Johnson undergarments.  (Sorry Victoria, but I think Betsy's secret might be better than yours)   I get everything for at least 60-70% off of regular retail so I look like a million bucks for only $400k.  Not bad!   I think the shoe department leaves something to be desired, I'd rather scour clearance in Macy's shoe dept.  Also they could try to hire some classier employees, but I'm pretty sure you get what you pay for.   Overall though I'm a fan, and I'm sure will "accidentally" wander in here many many more times in the future.

I used to frequent this RA on a very regular basis and absolutely loved it. Always received great service and was seated in a timely manner (even during rush time)  I just went here with a girlfriend a couple of Fridays ago and it was awful. I would give it one star except I'm hoping this might be a one time thing however many signs indicated it is not.  The wait was AT LEAST 30 minutes long, thinking it was worth it we waited, saw some friends and they got sat at a table large enough for us all to sit together so we only waited about 20. We were sat outside after being told there were misters to keep us cool. the misters were about 9 ft high and pointing in the wrong direction so we all sat there in an uncomfortable humid state of sweat.  We asked multiple times for extra menus and place settings and did not get them until AFTER our food was served. No soy sauce on the table had to wait for that too. My friend and I ordered sake bombers and they gave us water glasses instead of bomber glasses...they said they kept breaking so they don't provide them anymore. What kind of sushi restaurant does not have the appropriate glasses for bombers? They must be really struggling financially.  Our server was dull and unenthusiastic, no desire to please. Asked for more water and got it about 15 minutes later. If I wasn't enjoying the company so much I probably would have lost it and asked to speak to a manager. Server also didn't get my friends order right and so they didn't get one of the rolls they ordered until we were almost finished eating. Also they took away the mushrooms in the veggie tempura one of my fav items, big bummer for me.  We didn't dare order desert even though we wanted it. All of us are very good tippers and we couldn't even decide if this server deserved a tip. We ended up leaving 15% instead of 20-25%. I considered that very generous.  There are way too many new sushi restaurants that contend with RA or are better for me to have any desire to go back again. I wouldn't be surprised if this location shut down if they keep up that quality of service.

I've been here a few times now and I would say it is decent, slightly overpriced Mexican food. Their regular dishes are just OK. I have had their tacos and enchiladas and prefer Arriba's (right next door) or Carlos O'briens, just down the street. There is even some mom and pop place by my apartments that equates to the quality and taste.   What I like about Los Olivos is their Nachos. OMG this thing is huge. Imagine a large pizza in your head and then replace that image with the same size plate of nachos. I am not even kidding. Four or more people could munch on this. They do it exactly how I like it too, lots of cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole. YUM   That is what has been keeping me coming back, but after the other night I feel I am sure to find somewhere whose nachos make me just as happy.   Every time I have been here, it has been dead. And last time I came at prime dinner time. Then why is the service so awful? This kid kept coming up to our table and trying to take things. We weren't even half way done with our nachos when he asked while I'm in MID BITE "are you finished with that" not only asking but reaching his hand to grab the plate! And this happened repeatedly as we tried to finish our food. I don't know if they wanted us out of there or what. And then for someone who was so "attentive" I waited for 5-10 minutes for a drink refill (make the glasses clear and it won't be so hard to tell if I need more)   My friend and I left full but irritated. If I thought the quality of service was a one time thing I wouldn't even put this review up...but the fact of the matter is when you are paying for overpriced Mexican food in North Scottsdale, it isn't as if your options are slim.   My advice, go next door to Arriba's. Good food and GREAT service!

If I told you I found love at Giligins would you believe me?   No? I wouldn't believe me either.   In the most hopeless of hopeless places in Old Town (aside from maybe the Rusty Spur...I wouldn't even tell that story though that's just embarrassing) and on the most hopeless of days to be a single person out on the town (you called it, Valentines Day) I met someone. And I fell in head over heels, sappy, rom-com quality love.   Everything about this place is so wrong that when you add it all together it equals right. So maybe that is why what normally would seem impossible becomes possible. I mean, seriously. Who do you know that met someone at a bar in old town, much less one of the most rambunctious dive bars around, and it went anywhere past a one night stand or sexting relationship?   It ended predictably, but it was fun while it lasted. And I learned that love does indeed lurk in the most unlikely of places. And the best love stories find you.   Warning though, if you fall in love at Giligins like I did, don't expect the midgets to catch you.

The night is hot and sticky. The streets of old town have an eerily abandoned feeling as we realize it's 9pm on a Friday night and we are the only pedestrians around. Even in a sundress and sandals, I feel my skin glow with perspiration. After a bit of wandering, we realize we might be lost when I see a corridor lined with vines and trellises and my intuition and sense of adventure tells me to follow it. I grab his hand and lead the way blindly. He begins questioning my decision when I see a mysterious wooden door and before he can finish objecting we realize we found our way to the truth within.   We step inside and it feels like we found the closet that leads to Narnia. We walk into another world. Another time. Relaxed sounds of jazz caress our ears as our eyes adjust to the darkness and candlelight. We take in the old world feel, the stone, the wood, the beautiful sleek bar...that seems to be beckoning us to sit. Couples and groups of friends absorbed in each other on cushy couches and stools all with a sense of privacy and feeling that there is no world outside of this place and there is no moment other than now. His eyes meet mine and we know this is exactly where we want to be.  As we settle in at the bar, helpful suggestions are ready when we ask. He orders for me, as only seems appropriate in this mysterious and romantic era. Pinot Noir, Cabernet, plates of pâté, soppressata, brie, stilton white with cherries. I can taste the pure indulgence dripping off the mere words as they leave his mouth. The wine flows and the food is plentiful. Every sip, every bite, is something to savor and worthy of noting. Our conversation, whispers of love and beauty in each other's ears, lips close enough for a kiss. Knowledge of another world, remembrances of anyone else is lost as we fall under the spell that is Kazimierz.   When the night is over and we have no choice but to go back to where we came from, we reluctantly step back out into the warm, heavy night air greeted by sounds of traffic and rickshaw drivers ringing their bells. But as we leave, we take with us a secret. A sexy, decadent, mysterious secret that lies behind an old wooden door in the heart of old town.   The only way to discover that secret is to seek out that door and enter it yourself.

Congratulations Sushi 101.  You are my first one star review.  I have high standards for this category and you get to go down in my Yelp history as breaking my 1 star cherry.   This is the WORST sushi I have ever had.  I would rather eat the stuff from Kyoto Bowl.  In fact, in comparison Kyoto bowl sounds rather delicious to me at the moment, that is if you didn't turn me off from sushi altogether.   Happy hour schmappy hour, I can't believe people pay to eat this crap.    On top of that the service was awful.  I had a beer and finished it not half way into my time there and was never asked if I wanted another.   After that I find on my bill they factored gratuity into my tip.  The only time I know this to be a common practice is for groups of 6 or more. There were five of us.  I think they have to build in the tip because they know they are awful and wouldn't make any money otherwise.  College kids, I know you don't have much money but trust me, there are plenty of decent or even great sushi places out there that offer amazing HH deals.   I cringe to think of how many kids will have their first sushi experience here and will never know how truly delicious and amazing sushi actually is.

If I were ever to be grossly obese and it were due to the fact that I stuffed myself with Oregano's on a daily basis, I think I'd be willing to set my vanity aside and be quite content with that fact.   Needless to say, this is not a place to go while you are on a diet. This is the place to go when you want a good ol' fashioned carb overload Italian style. I consume more carbs in one meal here than I do in a month of eating at home. And I love every gluten filled bite of it.   Notable items:   Cheesy bread - two foot long loaf of soft wonderful white bread slathered in garlic butter with oodles of melty cheddar cheese blend. GAWD. This is my favorite thing on the menu. I don't even try to pretend I'm not a gluttonous pig when it comes to this stuff and I always help myself to the last piece.   Wings- BIG FAT drumsticks. All of them. Honey hot is delish along with the buffalo.   Caesar salad - holy crap their salads are huge. They have three sizes. The full (or whatever they call it) is big enough for four or five people to eat from if it isn't the main dish.   Bollo Pasta - with meatballs - Angel hair pasta and marinara with two huge meatballs, oh and the pasta is never ending. I have yet to see anyone get more than halfway through the first round though. *note angel hair being so thin sometimes the pasta has come out mushy(overcooked), all I've had to do was mention it and the problem was remedied in a very timely manner usually followed up by a manager visit, they don't mess around with customer service.   Pizookie - Obvi.   No, it isn't the best Italian I've EVER had but it is solid and consistent and really hits the spot when you want your fix. And the pricing is awesome. Lisa E, Nydia A and I binged at the one on Shea a couple of months ago, had the cheesy bread, wings and pizookie and our bill was $20. We sat there staring at the bill and each other dumbfounded for a couple of minutes.   If you don't like this place, all I have to say is "Wanna PIZZA me?!" ;)

I am flabbergasted. Flummoxed. Freaking the fug out.   WHY IS THIS PLACE NOT BEING TALKED ABOUT ON YELP!?!?!?  I'm sorry, I just had to get that out of my system.   But seriously, how is it POSSIBLE that only one review exists for Fantasy Costume Rentals and that it dates back to 2009??? This is a spectacular business!  First off, let me tell you a funny little story about my discovery of this gem. My birthday was a couple of weeks ago, and I was planning a little shindig for myself. In true Heather fashion (I tend to go a little over the top with everything I do) I chose to have a theme, the "Roaring 20's" as I was turning 29 (OMG I'm effing THIRTY next year?! When the hell did that happen??)  I digress.   I was looking for a costume and was unhappy with my choices at the "other" costume shop that shall not be named that seems to hold a monopoly on costume rentals in the valley. It was about midnight on a Sunday. I did a google search for costume rentals and Fantasy Costumes came up. I of course go straight to the reviews, and when I saw the only one written was in 2009, I was convinced they were no longer open. How would a costume fanatic like myself not know of this place? I decided to call the business number (keep in mind the time of night) to see if it was a disconnected number or if I reached a message listing hours. A man answers. Completely astounded to hear a live voice on the other end of the line, I stammered, "Um, is this Fantasy Costumes??"  "Yes, it sure is." "OMG, I'm SOOOO sorry for calling so late. I didn't think anyone would answer!" "It's ok, I have calls forwarded to my cell in case of emergencies."  "So, uh, when are you open?" "Tues-Sun 10am-6pm" "Cool, thanks. Well, I'll be seeing you in person soon! Goodnight!"  Located on University off of McKemy (near Hardy), this is a small unassuming shop that you really have to know about to notice. In the front of the shop are two large catalogs with pictures of the costumes in order of category, with a list of sizes each costume is available in. This makes it so easy to shop for something. I pointed at a couple of costumes and asked the owner about them. One he replied "That one's really cheesy. I don't think you'll like it, but this one (he points) is really nice." and then proceeds to bring out some options for me to try on.  For $45, I rented a super cute silver flapper dress (see pics), which came with a feather headpiece, long pearl necklace, boa, and free fishnet stockings!. The "other" costume shop wanted $50 for a similar dress and that did not include the boa ($10 extra), necklace, or stockings. Just the dress and headband.   My boyfriend also rented a super cool gangster costume, which the owner was sure to adjust the length of the pants for him before we picked up the costumes. Again, it came with everything. Hat, shirt, tie, gloves, shoe covers, and he even pinned a red carnation on the jacket! Last minute, Jared realized the suspenders weren't with the costume and he called the owner (on Sunday, the day he is closed) and the owner told him to come by right away and he would get the suspenders to him.   A couple of things to note. You can only pay with CASH or CHECK and a deposit (2x the cost of the rental) is required. But I will tell you, it is SO worth it. This guy is so organized, really cares for his costumes, and is not about nickel and diming. He provides a quality product for a reasonable price. I will be using Fantasy Costumes for my costume needs from this point on! Love love love!

"Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, you know? I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, it was only one woman for her. Joey: What are you talking about? One woman? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing. Cherry Vanilla. You could get them with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream. This is the best thing that ever happened to you. You got married, you were, what, eight? Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon. Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny."  I find myself with a similar conflict at the G spot. And Ross hadn't even begun to explore the world of gelato yet.   Wood fired pizza AND gelato in the same place should be illegal. There is just way too much happiness occurring all in one experience. And did I mention they are about to have cocktails as well? You know how after you experience your first orgasm, you want to just hide in your room and experience it again and again? Well, that's how I feel about the G Spot. They named it that for a reason, after all.

Last night, I had the realization that I am a true Scottsdale girl and I'm quite alright living in my Scottsdale nightlife bubble.   Here are some differences I noted:   Scottsdale: If you look good and are female, you get in for free and probably drink for free.   Hurricane Bay: If you look good and are female, thug looking dudes will stand outside of your car making sex faces, causing you to make your male friend come and get you for fear of what happens if you open that door and walk out there alone. Then you pay $10 to get into a not so hoppin Halloween party. Guys hump your ass without asking and without buying you a drink first.   Dress code for males in Scottsdale: Nice jeans, button down shirt, shaved or carefully groomed, and they usually smell like nice cologne.   Hurricane Bay: wife beater and jeans that haven't been washed in weeks. Hair that says I just got out of jail and tats to match. Standard cologne called BO.   Drinks are strong but their well vodka has to be a step above Gordon's.   Also, I think there may be dealers right outside selling rohypnol. Needless to say it is a creeper's paradise.   I'll stick with Blue, thank you!

Butterfields is breakfast at it's best.  It is the only place that can make better breakfast than me (I make some mean fluffy scrambled eggs and french toast, and the occasional breakfast burrito when I feel like going all out)  Seriously the best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to (it tops a place in Austin I thought could never be topped)  Portions are large and everything is fresh.  They even make their own orange juice (you can see the squeezer in the dining area and the crates of oranges are a convenient decoration and add a wonderful aroma combined with the other breakfasty smells.   I have tried their omelettes, amazing. California scramble sans the chicken, amazing. French toast, amazing. Pancakes, amazing. Huevos rancheros, to die for.  You can't go wrong at this place. It gets crazy busy on Sundays and you will probably have to wait for a table if you aren't an early bird but SOOOOO worth the wait.  I take all of my out of town friends here, a meal at Butterfields is something I think everyone should have the chance to experience!

I never thought the day would come when I'd be writing a review about fast food.   Here is the deal, this Jack in the Box is right next to my work and I happen to be a big fan of their iced coffee.  I stop in every morning to get it and if I don't my day just isn't right.    I am not a fast food person so all I can comment on is the iced coffee and the service.  I have created a following at work, my coworkers are now addicted to the iced coffee as well.  It actually tastes like coffee and you don't feel sick to your stomach after drinking it.   The service...this place is always busy and they are quick and efficient and the staff always has smiles on their face.   Special shout out to Perla, who is a sweetheart and I can tell is going places.  She always asks how my day is and has excellent customer service skills.  She can't help but make you smile!   I would give them five stars but out of principle I simply can not...it is a fast food place after all! ;)

I lived down the street from this place for almost two years before I even heard about it. I shouldn't have admitted that to you because now my credibility when it comes to knowing the "it" places in Scottsdale just went down the tubes. FAIL. But hey, if you are reading this review you probably haven't been there yet either so just shut up and read, ok?   Here is the dilly. I came here NYE. They had a $65 all you can drink special from 9p-2a that night. Nydia A. and I waited until the last minute to make plans and this seemed easy and pretty damn affordable, not to mention close to home. As a NYE venue I wasn't a big fan...but I do know a good (or even great) sports bar when I see one.   What it isn't: Hoppin with booty shakin music (we had to beg the DJ to play what we deemed "dance worthy" music), filled with beautiful people, packed to the brim with a thirty minute wait to get in, pretentious, where you should go if you are a Scottsdale DB looking to get laid.   What it is: A place to get good (strong) drinks for a reasonable price, convenient if you live within a five mile radius (they have a paddywagon free of charge), chill, and very conducive to the needs of sports enthusiasts. Oh and somewhere I can go without having to primp and wear six inch ankle breaking heels. (totally wish I got that memo BEFORE I dressed for NYE)   The bottom line: You'll probably see me there during football season proudly sporting a Tebow jersey, yelling at the flat screens, beer in one hand and hot wing in the other.

I absolutely love Dolce.  I was a regular at the Arrowhead location for almost two years but now Borgata is closer to me.  There is no other full service salon and spa like this that offers the same array of services at such great prices.  Yes, their prices seem steep if you look at their standard menu but they offer so many hook ups (discounts) on facebook if you are a fan, you can become a member for a nominal fee which comes with many perks as well.  I plan on doing that next time I go in.  On top of that their boutique is fabulous if I don't spend all of my money on pampering I'm bound to spend it on the chic and unique costume jewelry.  This is the place to go if you want to look good and feel good.   Special shout out to Jessica, my new hair stylist.  She spent four and a half hours on me doing a color correct (I was trying to get red dye out of my hair) and did so successfully without damaging my hair.  She was so diligent and made sure she really understood what I wanted before we got started (she actually did about a 30 min consult with me and decided to reschedule me for a bigger block of time instead of just rushing me through and risking a mediocre job)  Dolce has the highest of standards and it shows in every aspect, from check in (where you get walked to the seating area and offered a cool beverage) to the services rendered, to checking out (they always offer personal care products that applied to the service you received and every time they have been relevant to my needs) I heart Dolce and will be back as soon and as often as possible.

I had the opportunity to tour this property recently and I can't think of a single negative about the place. Starwood properties are always fantastic and this is the first W I've experienced. Although I did not stay overnight at the hotel, I was able to see a standard room and explore the property and see the amenities they have to offer.  The W Scottsdale meets up to it's brand's reputation. They have a "Whatever Whenever" motto which is what they hope to get across in the decor, service, and overall experience. The meaning is that the W will give you what you want, when you want it. They indeed have everything at their fingertips there.  Location wise they are right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale with dining, shopping, and entertainment all within walking distance. They offer a complimentary car service that will take you anywhere with in a five mile radius, if you even need the car at all.  The hotel itself is very modern and elegantly trendy. You can't help but feel it is the "IT" place to be. The rooms are simple and are focused on maximizing space so they are not set up like a traditional hotel room. Nothing about the W says traditional. They have their own very defined modern style. And they do not miss a single detail. As I walked around the infinity swimming pool (gorgeous) I saw a W drawn into the sand ashtray by the bar patio. They change out their mats three times daily to say good morning, afternoon, and evening. They anticipate your need before you have thought of it.  I enjoyed some cocktails in The Living Room, their main bar and lounge. Everything was superb, with funky names to the drinks and unique concoctions that made my taste buds smile.  Even though I'm a Scottsdale resident, I would definitely consider a staycation at the W Scottsdale. I could have a blast with out leaving the hotel. (It is also extremely conscientious of the business traveler, assuring that no matter the purpose of your stay your needs are fulfilled and you will leave with a smile on your face.)   Oh, and did I mention they have one of the hottest spas in town? (Bliss) also one of the hottest sushi restaurants as well, which I ate at and loved loved loved as usual! (Sushi Roku)   Like I said, can't think of a single negative! 5 stars all the way for the W Scottsdale!

Blue (as my girls and I call it) is my spot. I love it. I can't say enough good things about this place.  Starting with the ambiance: it is classy and modern without being pretentious or having the appearance of trying too hard.  The set up: I LOVE the flow of this bar, it is circular so you can make your "rounds" with out having to pass the same area twice if you don't want to (say maybe you saw a guy you used to date and you don't want to deal with him complaining that you broke up with him via text...we weren't actually together dude get OVER it!)...I digress...my favorite part is the indoor/outdoor area. Half of the bar allows smoking and is open to the street so it doesn't actually get smoky. Their misters are great at temperature control so I am usually more comfortable in the "patio" area then the indoor bar. Also the place has two BIG bars, huge plus since it gets very busy. The bathrooms (at least for women) are beautiful and sparkly clean. I can't say what a big deal this is to me there is nothing worse than half squatting to pee because the bathrooms are filthy and there are no toilet covers. ew. The attendant is very polite and not in your face like other bars. I think she might know me now, is that bad? he he   The drinks: AMAZING. Martinis are my very favorite and they do a fabulous job. $12 they are indeed, but where else gives you the shaker along with the drink? It is really like 2-3 drinks worth. They also have some very delicious and creative concoctions. My fav is the grape crush with the pretty flower as a garnish. The classic dirty martini is delish as well with amazing blue cheese olives. YUM.   The food: also AMAZING. I've only ended up nibbling on some snacks friends have ordered but each time it has been delicious. I keep meaning to go for their happy hour to try more stuff.   Speaking of happy hour, their HH prices are fantastic.   If you are a regular they will treat you like a VIP. I know the manager by name he always gives me a hug and has hooked me up for my special occasions (birthdays, celebrating singledom, etc)   The people: diverse and interesting. I love making new friends and chatting with strangers when I'm out and I have met so many great people at blue. Girls get catty with other girls b/c lets face it we're all in competition. The crowd is older and more mature. I am 27 and considered to be young but I have always disliked hanging out with people my own age so it works for me.   The music: almost always live, if not there is a DJ that knows how to mix and plays fun stuff. I like that they have theme nights.   Best nights to go: Fri, Sat or Wed (wed is ladies night ladies get a free drink coupon at the door and half priced drinks all night long.   My favorite bar I've ever frequented.   oh, and YES it is a meat market...but um, most of us that are out are single and looking, no? People that talk smack at meat markets are just angry because they don't have luck getting hit on or doing the hitting if you ask me!

So as you are all aware, football season has commenced.  Now that my roomie and I have NFL Sunday TIcket we are going to be spending football Sundays at home much more often than at the sports bars.  This means having a place that delivers good pizza and wings is a must!  We were pleasantly surprised to discover this location delivers to our residence.  I think they have a larger grid than most delivery places which is awesome.  I really can't think of a place that meets all the criteria my roomie and I have to really like a pizza delivery place.  Price, quality, taste, and service are all above average here.    We ordered one of their specials which was an X-Large one topping pizza with 24 wings for 23.99 and a 2 liter of coke.  With taxes, delivery charge, and tip the total came to $34.00.  We ate the pizza and wings for lunch and dinner yesterday, some friends munched on the food too and we STILL have leftovers.  At least half a pizza and a dozen wings.  I would call that getting your money's worth.   The pizza doesn't taste generic like the big chains I dare not order from.  I really like the dough, crust, sauce, and cheese.  I also like that they don't COVER the pizza in pepperoni (not a fan but I was outvoted).  Is there better pizza out there? Yes.  But this does exactly the trick on a football sunday.  The wings are delicous.  We had the medium sauce (which they do not skimp on) and it had the perfect amount of heat to it.  There were A LOT of drums which I found surprising.  And these wings came from some fatty fatterson chickens, they are very big and meaty!  Score, score, and score!  One slice of pizza and two wings did me in (I'm sure the beer helped!)  Also they gave a delivery time estimate of 45min-1hr and they delivered in less than 40.  Yes, I was keeping track.  Major points scored here.   Barros will be getting regular delivery calls from us for the rest of football season!

I've never been one to fall in love easily. Until now. Culinary Dropout was love at first bite.   Walking in, the decor of this place caused instant infatuation. I want to steal their purple wall and get a mini version of those wonderful green crystal chandeliers for my bedroom. Their booths are so comfy and the lighting was just right. When it cools down I definitely plan on spending some time having cocktails on their beautiful patio.   Our server, Tori was adorable and fantastic. Not only was she incredibly perky and attentive, she knew the menu like the back of her hand. And the way she described all of the items made me want to order one of everything. Also, she encouraged us to take our time. We started with an app, hung out and talked, then ordered an entree, hung out and marinated on that, and then ended with dessert. We were there for quite some time and never felt rushed or abandoned. Tori made our dining experience more than stellar.   Now to the important part. The A.maz.ing. food.   First out, the soft pretzels with provolone fondue. Oh em gee. I LOVE pretzels and cheese but I will never be satisfied again unless I'm having it at Culinary Dropout. The pretzels have just the right amount of sea salt (not too much) and are so fantastically soft. The fondue was the perfect temperature and they have a little candle flame to keep it the right consistency so you can take your time eating. Although those pretzels disappeared really fast.   Our entree, the sweet corn cannelloni. Thanks to Tori warning me this is seasonal and will change to butternut squash I was all over it. My friend and I split this and the serving size was still plentiful. I want to find whomever came up with the idea of putting mashed corn inside the cannelloni pasta and kiss them on the lips. The butter sauce was so flavorful but not too heavy and complimented the corn flavor instead of distracting from it.   Dessert. Words cannot describe. I have lived in a world where I believed the best dessert in existence was creme brulee with berries until last night. The salted caramel custard made me want to utter inappropriate noises of delight. Topped with their caramel popcorn and chilled at just the right temperature, my friend and I indulged in silence as our taste buds rejoiced. If I wasn't classy I would have licked the cup.   So, Culinary Dropout, I am in love. All I want to know is when we will meet again??? I'll be longing for you until that day.

This update is LONG overdue.   Mabel's has become one of my favorite spots and is a solid part of my nightlife rotation. With that said, it has also become the cause and center of many drunken stories! And we all know drunken stories are the best stories...but this is about Mabel's, not my shenanigans. :)   Music, whether live or spun by a DJ is always stellar. Makes me shake my groove thang and want to party like it's 1999!   Service, every visit aside from my first has been top notch. Twice I've had table service with Holly as our server. She is amazing! They really take care of you when you have a group/event. Greg, the manager always addresses me by name and says hi when I'm there. Pure class. Also, they have some hotties working there I love to flirt with. (Yes, I'm talking about you, Silas...I may not have twitted you but I Yelped you! ;)  Drinks/Food, fantastic. They have great bubbly here. And bubbly cocktails. Yum. Of course they have all the top shelf liquor. Bottle service is phenomenal. They get creative with your drinks for you if you want and we had this grey goose/soda/ginger drink that was major yum. I've only tried a few of the items on the menu (deviled eggs, scallops, and something else I can't recall, too much bubbly! hehe) but they were all delish and perfect for snacking. I was told they revamped their menu and I have yet to try the new items but look forward to it!   Now that the weather is cooler, they have started really enforcing dress code. You see a lot of guys in suits and ladies wearing their Saturday night best. Just the way I like it!   I can't say enough good things about this place. If you haven't been to Mabel's, you are really missing out. Your Scottsdale nightlife will not be complete until you pay them a visit.

If you want a good neighborhood bar, Ernie's is exactly that. This is the place I go when I'm not looking to get all dolled up but I still want to go out. There is nothing unique about it, it is just a bar that is good at being a bar. It also has all of the best activities for drinking.   I LOVE shuffleboard and a dive-bar is not a dive-bar without it. Great thing about theirs is it is in the patio area so you can smoke while playing (I smoke when I drink, yes filthy, disgusting habit I'm aware) ...sometimes they charge like five bucks for the pucks other times not, depends on the bartender I think.  They also have two pool tables, and I think golden tee.  Their is a room that has karaoke. I am a singer and enjoy karaoke from time to time, the night I participated there were some amazing singers and it was really fun to listen to everyone. The karaoke DJ. has a really good selection of songs, lots to choose from you will probably find what you are looking for.  I tend to get hit on every time I'm there which I guess is an ego boost but I would prefer to be left alone at a place like this. I'm usually in the mood to do my own thing with my own friends at a place like this and don't feel like making new friends but that's just me.   Not sure about their drink selection, I always just get Michelob Ultra (lame I know) or cranberry/vodka...the mixed drinks are strong, their well is gross though but to be expected.   Always a good laid back time at Ernies. They can count on me as a regular.

Gellish/Shellac is the new it thing for nails...the problem is many salons claim they do it and do it wrong.  The only place I found that did it right was Dolce, however they use powder which is harder on your nails (it has to be filed off almost like fake nails) I found Polished on Yelp and the 5 star reputation held up.  Michele, the owner is fantastic, she loves what she does and she talked to me for a good ten minutes on the phone to make sure they offered what I was looking for.  I got my nails done by Cari, PRO. They lasted 2 1/2 weeks the only reason it didn't last longer is because they were too grown out.  The price may seem steep if you don't understand that gellish/shellac takes much longer than a normal manicure (plus I'm sure the products are more expensive).  The ladies are fun to talk to, even the other clientele. It is very small (only two nail stations and I think three pedicure chairs) and boutiquey...love the vibe, the service, and the results! I will be a faithful customer for a long time.

I just had lunch with a friend here today and I had a fantastic experience.  I didn't see any reviews before I went, it was his suggestion, but getting on here I am surprised to see Brick has such low ratings.  Mind you it was slow (Sunday afternoon) but everything was delicious.  I am a big fan of the classic pizza margherita (with mushrooms) and I have to say they may have NYPD pizza beat.  If my stomach was a bottomless pit I would have just kept eating and eating. We had the house chardonnay to accompany the pizza which was wonderful.  It wasn't too oaky or even too buttery like a lot of chards.  I also had a small caesar, it was nice and fresh, the dressing was light, not as intense a flavor as I normally like but it was still very good.  My friend had ordered some parmesan crusted french fries while waiting for me (I was moving slow, partied a little too hard last night!) and I snagged a couple of those and I know if they were fresh they would have delighted my tastebuds as well.  I also like the ambiance. Very urban contemporary.  My friend says he goes there thurs/fri nights and it is hoppin, Live music, the whole shebang.  I think this might be my new go to when I'm craving exceptionally yummy pizza! And just when I started giving up hope that downtown phoenix had any "it" places left...

I came here a couple of weeks back to meet a group of Yelpers for beer, wings, and football.  The location worked for everyone, I'm not sure we picked it because we thought BWW was anything amazing, it was just convenient and met our criteria.   I have been to multiple BWW's many times and I just do not like them.  Service is always mediocre, no matter how busy or slow.  Our server on this occasion was actually a cutie pie and was very good natured as some of the boys at our table were flirting and joking with her and even as worn out as the poor thing was, she still interacted and had fun with them.  My complaint (having been a server before) is the way they had servers assigned to tables.  She not only had inside tables, but the patio as well.  When it is busy like this they need to be more strategic about assigning sections to servers so they are not constantly running.  The needs of the customer are bound to get neglected and their staff is going to be ragged not even halfway into a very long football Sunday.   This time around at BWW I had the fried mushrooms with a house salad.  I can honestly say these are probably the worst fried shrooms I've ever had.  Extremely doughy with a mushroom the size of a button inside.  Yuck.  The salad was far from fresh.  The lettuce was obviously wilted and that was pretty much all there was to it with the exception of a cucumber or two and some tomatoes.  I tried a friend's boneless wings and thought the meat was dry and there was not enough sauce.  I like my wings drenched in saucy yumminess.   The reason I give this place two stars is I discovered a new beer that I am a big fan of. Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat.  Make sure you ask for an orange garnish.    Am I a fan? No.  Would I come back and just drink beer for the pleasure of good company? Yes.

What comes to mind when I think back on my experience at Salt is: Identity Crisis.   This place can't decide what it's about or who it's about.   Walking in, it has a very loungy feel. A swanky, unconventionally shaped, contemporary style bar is the heart of the place with chairs and couches surrounding it.  It is very dark (a little too dark in my opinion) with very dim lighting...I felt like most of the light came from the gigantic big screen tv's hanging above the bar) I actually like the look of the place but I feel like everything else is a contradiction.   They had EXTREMELY loud hip hop music playing.  Dance club loud, and this is very obviously not a dance club. (I don't think? Like I said Salt doesn't know what it is so how am I supposed to?) I was on a date and found it very difficult to have good conversation without constantly saying "WHAT?!" "SAY THAT AGAIN?!" ...the upside that I'm sure my date appreciated is I had to snuggle in close just so we could talk.    The tv's were playing ESPN, highlights from one of the preseason NFL games. I love football but this just didn't make any sense to me at all. This place does not have a sports bar feel and the tv's seemed so out of place to me and I found them to be a negative distraction.   When we sat down at the bar it was SOPPING wet.  I asked the bartender for a napkin for my arm because I had set it on the bar for a second and he handed me a wet rag.  Really?    The drink selection is poor.  I had a glass of Sauv Blanc that I disliked very much.  My date was disappointed to find out they didn't have Guinness on tap.  Their beer selection was nothing to write home about.   The service was awful.  The bartenders were too busy busting a move to the hip hop music to notice the needs of their customers.  And did I mention there were only a handful of people in the bar at 11:30 on a friday night?  So what is Salt?  A hip hop night club?  A swanky scottsdale lounge? A sportsbar? None of the above.  Salt is just plain confused if you ask me.

A girlfriend and I were at Westgate for *cough* the britney *cough* spears concert.  Yea yea, you can question my taste if you want to because of that fact but I think we all secretly love her! Plus I got tickets on Groupon for half price (I claimed that was the only reason I went)  I digress. We were trying to find a place to eat and everywhere had a huge wait time.  We ended up wandering and finding Mama Gina's, we walked in and were seated immediately (good timing a huge crowd came right after) The server was very helpful in making suggestions.  Not wanting anything too heavy my friend and I decided to split the appetizer platter based on the server's rec, we each also had side salads and blue moons (on tap with an orange slice just the way I like it)  The bruschetta was to die for.  Some of the best bruschetta I've had. Fresh beautifully ripe juicy cherry tomatoes.  Cheese sticks tasted fresh, not dumped from a frozen box into a vat of oil, and the zucchini was delicious.  I wasn't a fan of the fried mushrooms, I have definitely had better.   I think this is a great addition to Westgate.  Their pricing is reasonable and the food and drink is good.  Nothing special about the ambiance, it is a small cafe type setting. We'll see how long the prices stay where they are but for now I give it a thumbs up!

Casablanca. With a name like that you expect great things. What comes to mind for me is the movie, which could very easily go down as one of the top ten films of all time. Casablanca might go down as one of my top ten worst dining/going out experiences of all time, so I guess there is SOME similarity? That's stretching it...  I am going to relate my experience here to the early stages of dating. You meet the guy and the first impression is fantastic. You even think "Oh my gosh, maybe he's THE ONE!" and you can't wait to spend time with them. Maybe you meet for drinks for the first date, the guy was late, but you have delish drinks and great convo. You can't wait for a second date. Second date, you go to dinner. the food takes almost an hour to come out and is awful but you don't want to be a debbie downer and say anything. You pick at it in awkward silence as suddenly the glamour of what could have been has worn off and you realize you don't have much to say to this guy. But hey, maybe it was an "off" night. Then the guy pulls the whole "I forgot my wallet" act and you are stuck with the bill for something you didn't even enjoy in the first place. On top of that, there are items on the bill you didn't even order, but you just want to get the heck out of there so you pay. There are lots of apologies, he still tries to kiss you, and you leave irritated and pissed off wishing you had those two hours back, BUT that musician at the restaurant was super hot. Hmmm, wonder if he is single?   Casablanca looks great and sends out a great vibe. I was initially excited we were kicking off the evening there. Then to discover they weren't ready for our group (and they had weeks of notice) and made us stand around while they pushed tables together, etc. AWKWARD. The light up menus and drinks were fun and began to turn things around for me. I LOVED their seasonal drink and the Sophia bubbly. Then the food came (literally after an hour of us ordering it, I don't think most realized this otherwise we all probably would have been disgruntled a lot sooner) The food is a JOKE. The cheese and meat plate, all I could think was "WTF?" It was pathetic. We all had the thought about Postino being way better. But to be honest, I can't even help you understand how bad it was. The fact that a classy Scottsdale joint would serve that to their patrons (with a $25 price tag) and think people will be okay with it blows my mind. Tiny pieces of cheese. Pre packaged, presliced salami. Crackers I can find at Safeway. The hummus, also pathetic. It should be called the tzatziki plate. And we were given maybe three pieces of actual pita and told they were going to charge us for more. WOW. The blue cheese olives were the only thing I found yum, unique and not disappointing.   Now we get to the fun part. The god awful service. Some girls got there late so I decided to hunt down our server so they could order a drink before we left. I was wandering for five minutes (and the place is not very big) before someone FINALLY asked if I needed help. I don't blame our server for this at all. This is management and the event coordinator's fault. (Oh, and the event coordinator, I'd like to know what exactly her job is. She greeted us, said she'd be back to get us a round of drinks and was never to be found again. It wasn't that busy nor did it look like there were any other large groups there) The manager finally came out as if to our rescue and made things worse. I would rather have dealt with the newbie server and walked her through it patiently. Instead it took us 30 minutes to sort out the bill, which was separated into eight difference checks (when we had asked that three of us get put on one to "make it easy", we were charged for items we didn't order, and even when they "fixed" it there were errors but we just rolled with it because we so desparately wanted to leave.   Luckily we went to Mabel's after which was a 5 star experience so the night was quickly redeemed and we had a BLAST.   The ONLY reason this place gets two stars instead of one: The entertainment was AMAZING and the place has potential to be better. I really hope they get their act together.
