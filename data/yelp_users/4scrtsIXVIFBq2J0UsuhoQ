My Husband and I were at this location on 12/24/2013. We have gone to this Denny's every year on 12/24 for the past 3 years. We met each other online and chose this location to meet  for the first time. 4 months later we we married, and every year we meet at this Denny's on the Date we met. Our same booth is always open LOL.... This last year we just happened to get the same waitress that we had the prior year and she remembered us. I wish I could remember here name she was cute and pregnant, I think she was due any day. She was excellent. food was excellent. Everything was clean even restrooms. I have been going to this Denny's off and on for the last 35 years.  and they do get 5 stars from me.. Thank you Denny's

This place is right down the road from my work. It's been very convenient in so many ways. I love the specials they run and the holidays. I usually come here for the photo center or to grab some essential toiletries.

This place is really great. The good here is very tasty and the they have lots to choose from off the menu. This is a great place to stop in and have some sushi or soup.

I love coming here for lunch! I usually get the club half sandwich or the Caesar salad. The tomato basil soup here is breath taking! I haven't tried breakfast here yet, but one of these days I will have to. I can never seem to get over the fact the cookies that come with your meal are so delicious and make for a great dessert snack during lunch.

Fun little sports bar in Goodyear! The employees here are very fun and know how to have a great time while on the clock. I have tried a few things off the appetizer menu and had a couple drinks. Food it pretty good, and the atmosphere is very fun.

Really cool bar right by Luke Air Force base. I love the outside entertainment here! The inside is a bit congested however that usually don't take away any of the fun associated with this place. I really like the theme in doors with all the planes hanging from the ceilings. Very cool!

Great people here. They are so helpful when it comes to all the questions I had to create flyers for a yard sale I was having! I really appreciated the help a lot!

This place needs some work for sure! First off how do you not have the ball ramps for younger kids?? You mean to tell me they are all broken?? How frustrating! There were many parents that felt ripped off because of the simple fact that the children were displeased with not being able to bowl with the ramps. It's was a sore sight to see looming down the lanes that every young child was upset cause they couldn't bowl like they anticipated with the ramps. After having bare witness with my grand daughter being let down and disappointed I doubt I will ever return to this place. Can't go wrong with their competitors. One day not have the ramps for kids cost this place my future business.

I love this place! Great food and music here! It's probably one of my new favorite places to come to inside Westgate now!  I really like the fact that they have a live band here on Saturday nights! This place was really Poppin one Saturday night when I stopped in with my husband. The band was awesome! The staff here are friendly and look super busy all the time.   I will be back soon! :)
