After my cat was severely injured I rushed to this hospital for immediate care. The entire staff was not only professional and nice but they really care about your pet.   The Dr thoroughly went over every single detail and was straight forward about everything. He followed up me with several times checking on my pet and going over the procedures he had done and what to expect and look for in the future. I couldn't have asked for better care and true concern for my baby.  Thank you Ingleside!

These quota meeting vets are the WORST in the industry! I've stupidly continued to come because their pet plan seemed so convenient but after visiting multiple locations it's clear they do not care about your pet whatsoever nor do I think they even really know what they're doing. After doing further research and investigation, I found out my dog is 100% fine from something they were so quick to try and tell me my 2yr old needed to be on drugs for the rest of of her life for. At $40 a bottle/month they almost threw a tantrum when I returned the unopened pills. The staff at all Banfield locations are disgusting. Please take your pet to a real vet! These scam "vets" should be shut down!

This place is the best! They make the best shakes hands down. I'm picky about shakes and I also don't spent an hour or more working out to then get a shake with some sugar filled puree and syrup, and you don't have to worry about that here. They tell you EXACTLY what's in it. The staff is super friendly and very knowledgable on any questions you have on protein or supplements too.

The Banfield pet hospital that petsmart provides is the absolute worst place you can take your pet. After my first bad experience I thought I would give them a second chance and I can't believe they had the audacity to be rude and hostile again! The front desk workers are by far the worst customer service orientated people I have ever had to deal with! They really make you feel that your pets visit is a burden and that they are doing you a huge favor. People work hard for their money and when you choose to spend your money with Banfield they should be a little more appreciative and courteous towards their customers. There are tons of independent vets I could take my pet too and yet I choose Banfield only to be treated so poorly. I will not return to a Banfield and I will be sure to tell everyone about my experiences with the rude, uncaring and unbelievable front desk people.

Sourdough is a true hidden gem. I've been coming here since I was a kid and will still make the drive out all the way from Scottsdale when I need a delicious pizza. A lot has changed in the plaza around but sourdough pizza is still as amazing as it was 20 years ago. Love love love!! Nothing compares. I recommend this place to everyone I know.   Please don't ever go out of business I would be heart broken.

This service department is great. I had some ongoing problems with my car and they were easily taken care here. Sam was very informative and knowledgeable about my cars issues and repair process. They even washed and vacuumed it really nice for me upon pick up.

I love this place!! I had never taken a pure barre class before (or even heard of it) and I can now say I'm addicted! The classes are just the right amount of intensity so you get an amazing and challenging workout but not too much where you don't want to return. They go through full body and I personally sweat my booty off from start to finish. All of the instructors are so incredibly nice and they help guide you with your form during the various workouts. You never feel awkward or that you're doing something wrong. This really is a great studio and I'm so glad I discovered it!

I was skeptical about bringing my new puppy here because I've heard Banfields aren't the greatest. Needless to say, going through my puppy's shot series I didn't have any issues nor was anything spectacular. It wasn't until her spay that I can honestly say I completely REGRET ever bringing her to a Banfield. My poor baby I wish I could take it back.  Her incision looks like the skin was quickly and effortlessly pushed and glued back together, the area still bloody and dirty looking and full of dried blood/glue who knows. She has little blood spots on her head and arm which to me shows an overall lack in not only skill but care and precision as someone clearly wasn't changing gloves or keeping the entire area clean as they're touching other spots on her body, again who knows. I was told the procedure takes 30-45mins but 5hours after dropping her off they still weren't done and at no point did I receive any type of update courtesy call. A procedure like this should end with the VET coming out and telling you exactly what he did, not the untrained appointment setter at the front desk (no offense).   AFTER WRITING THIS REVIEW PETSMART AND THE VET DID CONTACT ME AND APOLOGIZE.

I have to say I've always been a huge postinos fan but this last experience really ruined it for me. Our server McKenna seemed like she really didn't know our table existed, which is strange because we had a big group. We waited forever just to order drinks, even longer to get them which none were brought by her so it was a game of guess who when other people came to the table as they all arrived one at a time.  It took asking THREE people and for a manger if we could order our food for her to finally come over and ask if we were ready, because sitting blankly for over 20 minutes wasn't obvious enough. Upon finishing our food on tiny couch tables our plates sat stacked up and again after a long period of time she then shows up with checks. We were Not only not offered dessert which was really annoying considering we were there for a birthday but once she brought our checks she left the table one at a time to run them, Again with the horrible service. She finally asked if we wanted a birthday dessert but after hitting the 2 hour mark half our party had left.  Very disappointing when we could have chose any restaurant in the area and maybe gotten decent service.

This place is fun as a night club environment but we came here for food earlier in the day and it SUCKED. Everything about our experience from start to finish was horrible. Lip stick on our wine glass, took 10minutes for a side of ranch and 25 minutes for one the worst chicken caesar wraps I've ever had. Had the service not been so slow I may have gotten a chance to order something else. We did have a friendly ombr√© server but let's not mention the blonde that delivered our food was clearly over joyed to be working... Will not come here again. Maybe Bottled Blonde or El Hefe next time.

Stopped in here for lunch for the first time and had a great experience. Their patio is dog friendly which is always a plus in my book. All of the staff was very attentive and friendly. Our waitress never left us waiting for anything. The food was also great. They have a nice variety of things on the menu too. Definitely I'll spot I'll stop back into.

Loved this place! Got a gyro and fries and it was on point! Portions were great for the price also! The new owner/manager was above and beyond as far as being friendly and providing amazing customer service. We'll definitely be back to try a burger or something :)
