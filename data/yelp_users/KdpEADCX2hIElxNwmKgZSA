Poor service, poor preparation of food, food cold when delivered to the table. Calzone dough was raw and didn't even look like it was put in the oven. Fries were cold. A plate of shrimp and fries for 16 bucks? Really, who are you trying to emulate as your food doesn't have any business being served at those prices. You are not an upscale restaurant and your rating of an S shows that.

$=good deal :)=full tummy  This is the first time I have been to Wok In, the staff is very friendly and helpful and the restaurant is clean.  If you are a patron of those Express Chinese places (you know the one with the panda)...you will be impressed with this place, because 1...it is a sit down restaurant and 2... the food is better than theirs.    The orange chicken is wonderful, lightly battered and deep fried with a flavorful sauce...hot, steamy and delicious...not hard with a ton of batter and over done.  The chicken pieces were of a nice size and the portion...lets say this I had to bring half of it home.    The Thai Iced tea is wonderful and I was impressed with the value for the money.  I will make this my NEW place to get good Asian Fusion at a great price.
