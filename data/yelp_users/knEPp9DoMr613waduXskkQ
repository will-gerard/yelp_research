This is the only Florist in Scottsdale that not only never gets my order wrong, but always delivers timely! I've ordered with them over a dozen times at this point. I'm a romantic and like to send my Girlfriend flowers at least once a month Just Because...and I'm so glad Cactus Flower makes it so easy!   I only ever had one time where I wasn't satisfied with my order. I had ordered a southern theme mason jar, and some of the flowers were dried around the top and looked old. I called customer service and they delivered a new arrangement free of charge! Now that is customer service anyone can rely on! For that I will remain a loyal customer. I just love their TAKE10 deal they send me sometimes too, as well as their annual Rose promotions.

I love Redendos! The food is delicious and every one is always so friendly and helpful. All 9f their pizza salad and pasta options are great, but I highly recommend the Buffalo chicken calzone! It's really good.

I'll continue to give DJs my business, but only because they're the only place nearby that can make a toasted buttered salt bagel. If it weren't for that I'd never go in again. I'm a local of Fountain Hills, but honestly I can't abide by how the place is run. This is what happens when you leave a bunch of 13 year old girls with major attitude problems and no sense of order in charge.  I went in to the register since I'd called my order in and only one woman was ahead of me. The 13 year old at the register didn't smile and actually flat out ignored me. The 17 year old with tattoos all over her shoulders finally asked if I've been helped, then of course three other people cut in front of me. I had a very simple order and what should have taken 2 minutes ended up taking 15. It's almost like a bidding war rather than a line, and all the grouchy teenage girls don't help.

I like this location because the baristas truly seem to care about the quality of their drinks. They're always friendly and warm as well, which is a bonus.   I especially love their cold brew, which has been bitter at other locations,  but here they get the water to coffee ratio right and I've never tasted that bitterness in espresso drinks indicating the shots expired.   Everything comes out timely and made well.

I've been to two other nail salons in Fountain Hills and third time's a charm! I love the level of proffessionality they have, and they always deliver consistent quality service. Plus, the place is SPOTLESS and the chairs are brand new and COMFORTABLE, and they all work with nice desk sides. Doesn't get any better!

Rogue will always have a special place in my heart. They have a lot of fun events and their choices in live music are always on point. The atmosphere is pretty divy and colorful. The bartenders are never cheap with the alcohol. The crowd is always fun and chill.   This place is not for the vanilla types, but if you're different, unique, an individual who strays from the norm you'll be in good company at Rogue.

I love how quick and easy it is to order good to go and their thai iced tea is delicious and refreshing. I love the shrimp pad thai, but really everything is delicious. I will continue to return. They're also always quick and efficient with orders, never gotten mine wrong once.

Came in here recovering from the disaster over at Sushiholics and this place saved us. Beautiful atmosphere,  and everyone was inviting and warm. We both split a panini, and it was delicious.   The wine list was also impressive. I'll definitely be returning for brunch!

The actual VIEW itself is gorgeous,  unfortunately for the restaurant that's the best part.  I was with a party of 4 on Halloween and the place was mostly empty. There was live music so that was ok too. The food was mediocre and so was the service. I feel like they care more about their boutique and salon than the restaurant portion. Service is slow and nonchalant about making a good impression,  so they usually don't.   The drink menu sucked. I just prefer to give my patronage to a place that cares whether you come back or not.

I've been to El Encanto many times with many local friends. The food is always ok enough to keep me coming back. However the service has always left something to be desired for, but after what happened this afternoon I can safely I (nor my friends, since I've called and shared my story) will never be back.  Yesterday my friends and I split our bill three ways. I was the only one paying with a card. So my friends paid their share in cash. The total of the bill was 62.86 before tip. My friends added their shares plus tip all in cash. The waiter took the check without asking how we'd like it split, and so he charged my card the full amount even though there was a wad of cash. I politely explained only $30 was meant to be charged to my card. He took the bill away and returned with a check for the correct amount which I happily signed.   Usually when something like this happens they fix it and it's nothing to worry about. However, I just so happened to check my account this morning and I was shocked to see TWO charges. One for the full amount $62.86 and one for my correct  $30.00 charge. I live in the area so I simply drove over figuring it would be a simple fix.   Nope. The "manager" is either a thief or just really really stupid. I'm not sure which is worse,  but he refused to simply cancel the incorrect charge. First he asked for my paper receipt which I never keep, but the same waiter from the day before was there and he remembered me and the situation. Also, I had my Wells Fargo app open and could show him the charges. I also had my debit card on me. Proof enough. He kept claiming he had "adjusted" the amount, to which I said you've made a mistake, look at tge charges. A good half hour of arguing back and forth I finally just walked out, and I am literally stunned by the stupidity.   Why wouldn't he just void the incorrect charge????   I have paid them $92.86 PLUS whatever cash my friends shelled out for their portion of the check and tip. I'll certainly be in touch with upper management with my bank statements handy but I will never be back.   How could they treat regular paying customers like this? :(

This is hands down the best place to eat in Fountain Hills! I have never once been disappointed with the food or the staff. Service is always on point, and the food is consistently delicious. I highly recommend the seafood quinoa paella! Sooooo amazing and totally worth the $21. The drinks are always good, never cheap the alcohol or watered down.   Be sure to go!

The food is consistently delicious, although high priced considering the service. Always seems like there's only 2 people working which probably suits them fine on a week night, but not a Friday. I had the shrimp tikka masala and it was spicy and delicious. It's a nice location, and a nice looking place.

The food is decent and they give out big portions so you'll never leave hungry. Service is great, but the waitress had the giggles. Everything she said was followed by this little girl laugh, which might sound cute, but was actually kind of weird.  The spirit bomb is my favorite dish there, but their sushi is really good. Another favorite is the crunch target. Atmosphere is typical for a sushi place.  Everyone is polite and warm, and the one time I had bones in my sushi so they apologizef, brought me a new one, comped my meal and even gave me a free dessert. It's service like that that keeps me coming back.

The food is always excellent. I enjoy the atmosphere. I don't recommend the car wash services as the 2 times I've used them I've had to go back with miscellaneous complaints. But the food and gas is great. Would be a 5 star, but the last couple of times I've ordered for pick up I ended up waiting even though I ordered 30 minutes ago. There's a big bald guy and whenever he's around things always seem to be running more smoothly, but when he's not around it's long wait times and chaos.

Love the Stand! Burgers always delicious, and the stand sauce is really good too. The food in general is consistently great, but the very best thing on the menu is the dolce de Leche salted caramel milkshake! Be sure to try it.

Yeah I'm gonna have to go with the majority here. The food is really mediocre and over priced. I had the "pad thai" with shrimp which tasted freezer burned. They went way too heavy with the lime and onion, and it was topped with maybe three peanuts. My girlfriend had the buttered chicken curry, and it was also really bad. Tasted like cheap tomato paste with a hint of curry spice. No one knows how to cook, but the ingredients are just awful. The chicken tasted like it came out of a can.  But the worst part: the "Vietnamese iced coffee" is a joke. It was dirty, old maxwell coffee with a pump of Hershey syrup. Huge disappointment and a total lie!

Gorgeous outdoor seating!  Also, I love the ambiance: roasting kennel for coffee right in the center of the shop, the delicious aroma of fresh coffee, and the minimalist approach. They were polite and efficient, and the coffee is really good!

Service is very poor. The "manager" is rude, and the drinks SUCK. watered down and over priced. The "menu after 10" is a few shitty options and the "manager" rudely informed us "everything is locked up and put away!" when we asked if we could get the cheese plate option. He was really horrible and condescending about it. Its just cold cheese, what is it under lock and key? Sure the food is ok, but the wait staff just makes the place unbearable. If you go, don't go late.

I love this place! The food is usually really good, minus one time when my prime rib dip was a little too fatty. They were great about it though. I say order anything with lobster as they're never cheap with it. Drinks are good too!

Wouldn't know how the food was. My Girlfriend and I walked in and saw the "Please Wait to be Seated" sign with no one at the front. So we wait...and wait...and wait. 5 minutes goes by...then 7. At this point other customers were starting to stare. I made eye contact with wait staff members, but they gave no sign of acknowledgment towards us. A simple "we'll be right with you ladies" would have been nice at least. We finally just walked out at 15 minutes. Not sure what the disconnect was, but it certainly was not a busy night. There were several open tables as well seats at the bar. Sad.
