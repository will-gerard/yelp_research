Stopped by for a gluten free pizza at this location although we usually go to the one in Ahwatukee. This location pales by comparison and the pizza was not very good. At all. Regular pizzas might be better but I'll never know because I won't be back. The interior is tired and dingy too.

Wow. Yum. Great fresh food mix with wonderful flavor. I'm not a big drinker but we got there during happy hour and I took advantage of the $5 price for their creative cocktails.   This place is a great antidote to frozen-microwaved-premixed-mass production -commercialized food that is used in so many restaurants today. But it has flavor! (True food restaurants sometimes are so busy steaming veggies that they forget to use true food seasonings) Great price point too.   The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it was really hard to hear each other at our table because of the level of energy and noise in there. Next time we'll ask for patio seating.

I stopped in here before a meeting to grab something to eat with my husband. We love the concept and the design is wonderful. The cupcakes look great but the vanilla one I had was awful. The frosting was made of cream cheese (they should have mentioned this somehow) and was a gorgeous sparkly pink. It had been in the fridge and was hard and stale and tasted like it hadn't been made with cake flour but all purpose, heavy and gluey flour.    My husband got the cobb wrap and it was sweet and he didn't care for it. I got an egg salad on a croissant, and the best thing about my lunch was the Frito's they added to the plate. They put in all kinds of stuff in the egg salad (were those dates?) and  I regretfully had to throw it away, along with my cupcake.  The cupcakes look great, but save yourself the trouble, and don't.

Chick FilA is one of the best fast food restaurants out there. They have really worked on the friendly-ness factor. BUT...This particular location has the most languid bunch of workers I've ever seen. I saw four people walk out because the 7 people working behind the counter didn't step up to wait on the customers -- they were too BUSY doing other stuff like paperwork, and stacking cups.   When it was my turn, I waited at the counter for 5 to 7 minutes in awe of the complete lack of service. Only one cash register was open while four more customers behind me waited to get somebody - anybody's attention. Plenty of employees were there all milling about and chatting amongst themselves. Hello???  Is there anything more important than the customers? Here's a case where they have gone out of their way to provide decent fast food, a clean environment, small extras like diapers in the bathrooms, fresh flowers, and great attitude by the employees, but then FORGOT to take their orders. I won't go back to this one.

I was at Black Bear today with a group and when I didn't get my order in over AN HOUR, yup --  60 minutes -- despite two pleas to the server, I got up to talk to the manager.   By this time, most everybody in my party had finished and the waitress was cleaning up. I went over to the counter and could see in the kitchen that the staff looked grim and super stressed out. There wasn't a smile for miles.  The manager offered no excuses or apology as he emerged from the kitchen - just a 'Yeah, what? I told the manager what was going on and wondered aloud what was going on. "I am beginning to wonder if I have to go to Taco Bell to pick up something to eat."    He said, "Then why don't you?"  Wrong answer.  My husband went to go talk to the guy afterward, and the manager stood his ground and said I was rude.  Me? Seriously?  If he couldn't offer a simple apology or explanation, then you should know that his crappy attitude is rubbing off on all of the staff, and these are the people making you something to eat. Is that yummy???  Black Bear Diner has a pretty big menu for a diner but you'll get an unexpected side of  "I don't give a s**t" with your meal.   Ya know, there are just so many other places to get lunch at that I don't see any reason to go there again, ever.

Got a snack with my husband here to hang out someplace pleasant but remembered why we don't like Applebee's. Nice environment but the food is awful. Got the onion rings and spinach dip with chips. Dip was good but the chips were old and the oil had gone rancid. Really? Get some fresh chips people!   The onion rings were factory made, frozen and cooked. They were all fried batter and cardboardy. The barbecue dip tasted like pancake syrup with coloring, garlic and smoky flavoring. We asked for Ranch dip and it tasted like something out of a packet from McDonalds. Nope. If you want real food don't go here.

Here's the bad news: Maybe it's just me, but I don't like walking across peanut shells to get to my table. I guess some people think it's fun to throw shells on the floor. The environment is otherwise just fine and the menu has plenty to offer. My husband got a burger and I got the grilled meatloaf with a salad and mac n' cheese as a side. The hamburger tasted of bread filler and the meatloaf was like someone had spilled a bottle of onion powder into the mix. OH - I almost forgot. The water is undrinkable and tastes terrible. The server said they get a lot of comments on that and that they filter it but I wondered with what. They gave me a soft drink instead, but even that had the unfiltered water mixed in with it.   Here's the good news: they serve excellent warm rolls while you're waiting for your food. I could have eaten just these. They have plenty of beer for people who like that, and since the water is awful, bottled beer might be a good bet.

We were looking for Mexican food today in Scottsdale and happened upon Blanco. Nice location, well-appointed, and adequately staffed. We came in well after lunch but before dinner - 'Linner." I got the fish tacos ($13) and my husband got a cheese enchilada ($10). I was served three tortillas no more than 3 inches in diameter with bits of chopped stuff and one piece of fish the size of my thumb in each. I'm a small person, so this was okay, but the fish was almost inedible. Awful stuff. My husband's enchilada was in a small iron skillet and had a sugary sauce. Disappointing. I couldn't get a regular iced tea either - they only had passion fruit and green hibiscus. I got a pomegranite/grapefruit margarita which was pretty good, but pretty light overall. If you were looking to party, you'd have to down several of these $9 concoctions to really feel it. Total bill, with tip, for this affair was just under $40.  Skip it if you're looking for a nice meal. If you're looking to hang out with friends, munch on some appetizers and drink, then it's sorta kinda okay.

I'm no stranger to good Italian food, and I wasn't expecting anything special but I was knocked out by the quality of Carrabba's food. The tomato basil soup was absolutely fresh, with complex flavors, texture, and spice, along with lovely wilted basil leaves to top it off. I thought this would be chain restaurant stuff, and it's really quite a few steps higher quality than its price point. I loved the olive oil dip and bread (which I tried not to overeat), and my husband and I shared each other's entree. I'll be back!  Highly recommended. Attentive service too.

Wow. If you're looking for a way to relax and get a lot for your money, this is an hour well spent. Kudos to my therapist. I'm coming back! Affordable prices starting at about $30 an hour. And right now, they are offering $30 for 75 minutes for a Christmas special. OMG!

Booked a massage after having a stressful week, and felt like heaven afterwards. Marie was absolutely outstanding, and is very knowledgeable. I spent some time talking with her when I got there, and we talked about what kind of massage would solve my issues. I loved loved loved the essential oils - the whole room smelled wonderful. I'll be back for sure.

My husband and I worked with Danielle Zampino to buy an investment property in our IRA. (I recommend this - it's a great way to build your retirement account)   It was a tricky purchase because it was a HUD-owned foreclosure and initially, our bid was accepted but ultimately turned down by  HUD's part because the feds have rules for IRAs that HUD was unprepared for.   Danielle worked with us to resubmit the bid as they advised, but HUD rejected it on the second go-round! Danielle held up great under the pressure and we were finally rewarded when the HUD buyer fell through.   Finally, we were able to close the cash deal and it took a total of three months. This wasn't a huge commission for Danielle, but she worked just as hard as if it were. Great professionalism and personal service!

On time. Worked hard. Thanks Patrik for doing a great job. My carpets had a lot of crushed areas and it looks much better now.
