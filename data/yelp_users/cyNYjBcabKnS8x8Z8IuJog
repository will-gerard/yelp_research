No more...terrible service Arrived on a Sunday, 1pm..ordered food and sat down  It didn't appear that crowded but the staff seemed overwhelmed   Waited 22 minutes for food, asked for it too go, we were in a rush so we didn't check the bag.  We ordered 1 sandwich, 1 soup and 1 half  sandwich half salad.  We get back to the office and check the bag...1 sandwich...1 salad.  They left out the soup and half sandwich as well as the cookies.  So we paid 24.00 for a sandwich and half salad. They sure didn't forget to charge us, they just seem to be unable to deliver what the charge you for  NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK

Good Stuff, this is what Mexican food dreams about!!  Took  my folks in for late lunch one day, hit it right on time as we were seated right away and then the line formed.  The best: the guacamole, made at your table with pomagranites...  The really really good: pescado Delmar..outstanding shrimp, crab fish all cooked perfectly.  The only down side is once you treat your self to this outstanding meal, the bill comes and it is a little pricy.  Will we be back...yes its worth it

I have been a phoenix local for 30+ years, recently moved out of town and came back over the holidays for a visit.  Lets start with the good: The location central to everything right across the street from the preserve.  The Bad 1. Paid for a suite with a view, the first night we were there we had no heat. spent the night very cold 2. Moved to another room, much smaller with no view. Explained the difference to the point where someone came up and said yeah this is a lot smaller 3. Moved to a third room, same issue much smaller up about ten flights of steps. 4. Ordered food..overpriced and under whelmed  Asked for a correction on my bill when I was being moved around...due to no heat and was advised we will see what we can do...but nothing happened  Sadly this well known landmark is no longer the gold standard resort that is once was

Z PIzza - wow you let me down!!  We eat zpizza somewhat regularly, Not my favorite but the wife likes it so if we are having pizza this usually it.  In phoenix for business, went to grab lunch at the 53 West Thomas location.  Service: the service was ok, a young man that was very eager to help us took our order quickly.  Order: I ordered the California salad, trying to eat light for lunch to combat the 118 day heat of the day. The order came out quickly and they called my name.  I picked up the food and after a quick glance..realized there must be a mistake. I think you gave me a side salad I mentioned to the manager. He looked at the salad and stated no that's the California salad. I mentioned the price as a question. "This is 11 dollars?"   His reply "no, wait did you get a drink?" Me "yes" Mgr "then yes 11"  The salad contained roughly 1.5 cups of mixed greens, 4 slices of cucumber, 1/4 of an avocado, 2 narrow slices of tomato and a few black olives. Easily contained in a side salad bowl.  I didn't want to make a big issue out of it, but I did advise him this seems like a very high price for a very small and plain food, and that zpizza may get the better end of the deal today, it would be my last visit.  BTW Mr. Manager - you probably shouldn't serve customers very small portions and then justify the price and the portions while holding your personal salad that looks like it would fill the grand canyon. You should treat your customers the same way you treat yourself.  My co-worked also felt the same way, to the point he had to pick up lunch two on the way back the office.

Stopped by to look at some suits, we live in flagstaff-az and we're dressed for the climate. Jeans, warm jackets. .just out of the car.  Entered downstairs and we're greeted by a kind lady, she directed us upstairs. We went up stairs and we're ignored completely by not 1 or 2 sales man but 6  6 sales guys standing around chatting. Each looked at us and then promptly returned to there conversation. My teen age son said to me, "you can buy a suit here right"...I said yes I can. ..but I will not now.  Hey brooks brothers. .. here is some advice, just because people don't flaunt there money doesn't mean they don't have any. I have mine and you're not getting it now

So brooks brothers reached out to me via email, advised me someone would contact me....and cricket's, nada, nothing. No one emailed no one called, zero follow up  Business must be so good they don't need customers

I always love hoping to humble pie.  The brushwork is awesome, the garlic fries are great.  I HIGHLY recommend the roasted mushroom pizza. Service is always great and the price is good  This is a goto place for me when in phx

Pretty good quick Mexican food, stopped here based on the recommendation from the clerk at the as station. Never thought I would say that but was worth the stop.  Asked the server what was good, she recommended the mixed plate...shrimp, beef, chicken etc...good stuff I will be back

Not a bad place for lunch   Went in for a quick lunch, when attending a seminar in phx   I ordered the Cuban and a salad. Service was quick and food was good. I was impressed with the half salad as most places seem to skimp on one item or the other when getting a sandwich with salad.  Only reason for 4 verse 5..the servers seemed to take a while for my sandwich, could have been an off day

Food was good Service was mediocre, no coffee or water refills??  Maybe it was determined that the cool weather didnt require?  It was disappointing that the service was poor as the food was good

Went into the store looking a specific item, Had my little man in tow (18 months) so we were moving slow through the store.   Saturday morning (10:30 ish) one other customer was working with a gentleman behind the counter. A young lady was wandering around behind the counter looked at me several times.  I was never approached once I was not asked if I could be helped I was not asked if I had any questions  As far I could tell, by the number of times she checked her cell phone, she was more interested in seeing her results to her last race (she still had the decals of her number stuck on her arms).  Any way I took my business down the road as I didn't want to interrupt her texting or social media updates as they were clearly more important that any purchase a customer was going to make.  Sorry unlikely I will be back
