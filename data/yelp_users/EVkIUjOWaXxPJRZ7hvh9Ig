I like Jordan T went to tour this place and was met with an extreme disinterest from Lauren as well. was asked the basic questions as far as move in dates etc. the question of an eviction came up and was met with extremely rude remarks. would not live here based completely upon this persons rudeness and lack of interest in her job. actually according to lauren  they wont rent to anyone with a backruptcy or eviction. over priced and rude. theres much better in scottsdale for the price.

I've been using dannys since I moved here in 1999, I can honestly say after the last 2 times I have been there I will no longer use them. My car did not look like it had been cleaned inside short of a quick pass with the vacuum,  the car sat out in the sun and was covered in water spots which I brought to someone's attention and was assured they would be wiped down again, they weren't.  Management could really care less about quality of service then cranking out cars. If you do need to go here just pay for the cheapest wash and then just expect substandard results

I had heard good things about this place, My friends were wrong  They seemed a little busy, asked to place a take out order and was met with an extremely quick and rude come back in an hour. Really?

I've lived in this complex for 2 years now and have nothing but good things to say, I have never experienced any issues like the lady below me with the staff. In fact i have found all the girls in the office and the maintenance people to be extremely friendly and fast to dealing with any issues I have had. I would recommend this community to any of my friends or family.
