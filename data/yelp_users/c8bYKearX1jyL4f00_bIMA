EDIT: I'm working with MV now on a resolution. They seem like they want to make my experience right.  I'll update this review when the work is done...looking forward to seeing how it turns out.  I tried to use Moon Valley for landscaping services to the tune of about $5000-7000 worth of work, and I couldn't pay them to take my money.  Absolute terrible service.  I've been canceled on the same day twice now by their landscape designer.  He also told me he would call me back in 15 minutes with a new time and never called.  So I called him the next day and left a voicemail about not hearing from him...still no call.  I scheduled some time off work to meet him during business hours at the nursery and was canceled on.  I can only imagine their landscaping work is as bad as their communication and planning with their sales people.  I would not recommend spending a dime here.

I feel ashamed for not updating my review sooner, but these guys did quality work and worked to make it right.

The service here was fantastic and personable and you can tell they care about the food they serve.  I ordered a steak sandwich and it was hot and good.  The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars was because they don't take credit cards and I didn't see a bathroom anywhere. But if you want fantastic food at a simple, relaxing deli...can't go wrong here!

I used to love this place and come here all the time, but new people and other changes have just really brought the quality down. Things that went wrong with my last visit:  -main issue, they used to put lots of bacon on their blt's (9 pieces...they actually told you that to assure you), but I've had a few bad ones so I first ask "do you still put lots of bacon on your blt's?" And was assured they do. I say great and order one. I got at best 2-3 pieces. I took a picture I'm going to try and attach to this review. It was a weak sandwich...but I asked before ordering and was assured there was plenty. -two of us at the register (holding hands) and the cashier only takes my order and immediately runs off, and I have to get her attention to tell her the second order, and she runs away before I can order drinks...so I got waters instead of wine -asked for a half cranberry croissant on wheat (instead of croissant)and soup, they can't do half a croissant...but I asked for wheat bread? So i ask for a half turkey on wheat with cranberry added. She tells me, "well that's just a cranberry croissant on wheat, which we can't do a half of"...so we just got a turkey...but when they brought it out they let us know they managed to add cranberry to it lol... -the sandwiches come with a pickle spear. Neither of us got one. I go up and ask, they bring me one...I ask for a second one because 2 people...sigh  Still pretty good place but this is the third or fourth time in a row and it has been getting worse each time. I ordered drive through breakfast last time and got bacon egg sandwich, then before I drove away I asked if it was a bacon-egg...and she said "yup bacon egg!" And I get home and it's a bacon-sausage.  I'm not excited to come here anymore.  Paying $9 to look in a paper bag and see 3 pieces of bacon, tomato, and lettuce on sliced bread with only a banana just doesn't seem worth it.

I'm going to update my review to 4 stars because the management is fantastic and really cares about their customers.  We will definitely be back.  Most of my issues I think have come down to growing pains as they're getting busier and the newly hired employees haven't taken the same attitude to heart yet.  I would still like the lights dimmed a bit for dinnertime for atmosphere and ambiance, but it's a fun place to relax for a weekday dinner.

The owner on the phone was great, but the actual service performed by the worker and price was not worth it.  The worker was very polite/nice too.  The service amounted to be a basic snake clean-out that took maybe 30 minutes, and the worker left a new mess on the floor.  Some of the debris stuck in the line came out with the snake, and it was just left for me to clean up, in a previously clean room.  I paid $150 for around 30 minutes of work, where I had to help carry the equipment down the stairs, I had to pull the washing machine out to access the clean out, I had to pick up the sewer junk pulled out of the line off the floor, and I had to shove it all back.  Which I was more than happy to do expecting a basic clean out rate because the worker was doing a very basic and quick task.  What ended up being a routine service should have run closer to $75, mainly because if you snake a line and pull out sewer debris and leave it on the floor, you don't just pick up your tools and take off.  Edit (to reply): The flat rate included an extra charge for pulling a toilet because I didn't think I had a clean-out available.  When I found a clean-out, the toilet no longer needed to be pulled from the floor.  I've worked with many plumbers in several properties in a few states and I can tell you the worker cut corners and didn't perform close the service I paid for because his wife or someone on the phone was bugging him (call/text).

Fantastic food. Chef's board was great. I'd recommend one of their fancy cocktails with dinner. Our server Brian was hilarious. Only thing was you have to get there early'ish to get a prime seat.

Very cool atmosphere. Something this Scottsdale area definitely needed for those of us who work in the area. It's a nice get away from the work day.  Food is just fantastic! The burger + cheese is definitely worth trying even if it sounds simple. Fries were outstanding too. No complaints.
