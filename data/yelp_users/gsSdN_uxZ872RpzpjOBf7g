Deb is the best in the business.  I have been using holiday hound for 8 years and have used for 3 big dogs. Two mastiffs and a St. Bernard. They are accommodating and are attentive.  Love this place.

great wall has some of the best chineese in Arizona.  Since Big Wongs closed in down town Phoenix i have always searched for the best Walnut Shrimp and I think I have found it.  Amazing as well as all their rice and noodle dishes.

Didn't get to try the place. Hours of operation on Yelp said open til 8pm today. I walked in at 2:30 and the guy at the register days sorry we are closed.  We closed at 2pm today.  I said oh ok. Just so you are aware it shows on Yelp your open til 8 pm. He smirked at me and didn't say a world. Was very strange.  No idea on the food.
