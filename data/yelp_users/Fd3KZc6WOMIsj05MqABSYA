Love at first bite! If I could eat like this everyday and still be able to fit into my car, I would buy a table there! It is a bit of a hike for us but well worth it!

We drove 40 miles to try Old Heidelberg and were not disappointed. Pretzels were great and the almond horns were amazing! We also picked up some brotchen and rye as well. We tried it all when we got home and it will bring us back. I cannot understand the bad reviews about the owners, they were very friendly and helpful and a joy to do business with.

Our first and so far only visit was very nice. We caught the tail end of brunch after the symphony and got to take advantage of the unlimited mimosas. I am an eggs Benedict snob and seriously feel that 9 out of 10 places make them unpalatable. Blue hound not only had a good Hollandaise sauce but they mastered the perfect poached egg! Score! Our server was a tad slow but never too bad and consideration was given to the fact he had a large party in addition to the restaurant being quite busy.  We will definitely return!

I have really tried to like this place because I love the concept. I have been several times, always because a friend chose the venue. Last night was the final straw for me. I ordered a martini and was served something unidentifiable in a small cocktail glass that tasted just horrible (it was taste tested by others who concurred). I returned the drink and ordered another type of drink and again just horrible, like someone was behind the bar just throwing well liquor into a shaker. I did not send the second drink back I just figured I was not going to get anything palatable. I then ordered a strawberry salad. I received my salad minus two of the ingredients listed and with a chicken breast on top of it. I do not like chicken breasts so I pointed out that I did not order the chicken which is a 3.00 additional charge. I was assured that the charge would be taken off my check and I volunteered to just remove the chicken myself fearing another possible screw up the minute my food left my site. The salad was $10.00 and it was actually smaller than my friends side salad! After ordering three things and not getting one thing as ordered (not special requests, actual menu items), I then got the check which of course was wrong! The chicken I did not order was still there. At this point our server was actually starting to act put out....Really? 3 items ordered, 3 items messed up and you are acting put out????? In talking with other friends about my experience they have all confided that they have had similar experiences. I think it is sad, I think we need a place like HAPH, but come on!!!! Hire some people that know what they are doing before they bankrupt your business!

The Gilbert location is great and we always enjoyed it. After moving closer to this location we have been a couple of times and I just cannot find one thing good to say about it. The service is half @ss the food is rarely hot when you get it and there is no remorse for their lackings. We came in one day 20 minutes before closing (we thought we had an extra hour but they close at 1 on this day) and they refused to seat us. If you truly enjoy the food at over easy go the extra few miles to the Gilbert location you will not regret it.

We love to Brunch and this place hits the spot for us! Sometimes there is quite a wait but that should not reflect badly on the establishment it just means others find the food fabulous as well. The benedicts are great and they actually know how to poach and egg :-) The pancake sampler is pure indulgence but worth getting to share with a friend or partner. The service is great the staff is friendly, Easily the best brunch/breakfast place in Gilbert.
