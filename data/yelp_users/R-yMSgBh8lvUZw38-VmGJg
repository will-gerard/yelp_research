Walked In Today and asked for a fill. The lady told me there was an extremely long wait. There was only one other person in the chair and she was already being worked on and insinuates I should leave. I left. If you don't want my business, I certainly won't give it to you. Went to another salon and had to wait, I don't mind having to wait at all, it was the tone that was used.

Great decor, the food was good! The brownie sundae was amazing!! Big enough to split. Tons of GOOD beers on tap! A lot of tvs- bar area and a separate dining area. The owner was walking around talking with people and helping out the staff. It was a great experience and will definitely come back when in the area.

Not a fan of this place at all! Went to get a full set, they didn't cut them to the length I wanted, after I picked a color she then went and got a similar one in gel and said that she would only do that. I didn't know it cost $12 extra for gel polish. Would have been fine with just the gel top coat. Burned my nail beds like crazy they were sore for 2 days after. I'm scared to take my nails off as I don't think there is much of my actual nail left. I will NEVER return and if you care about your nails in any way, you shouldn't go here either.

Kristy does amazing work. I am so happy she is back from Denver, she did my hair prior to leaving for a year or two. Hair coloring, new styles, eyebrow waxing, she even does make up services. I've walked out of there looking like a million bucks many times! Her haircuts last too! They keep their shape and functionality. You are missing out of you don't visit her!

I had numerous issues on my stay. 1. The carpeting is so old and in the hallway you can actually feel whee the floorboards are worn out because you trip while walking through.  2. Our room had a stench in it when we walked in, couldn't figure it out at first, then after returning from dinner, we figured it out - there was a moldy hamburger in the microwave from the last person that stayed. Made us wary of the cleanliness of the room.  3. The pool area had a smell as well. It was a little like sulfur.  4. The carpet in our room had heavy worn out spots and I wore my shoes for the most part because it was pretty gross.  5. The beds were lumpy and the pillows fell flat pretty fast.   The good points - the a/c worked well and the staff was friendly.   Just needs severe updating and maybe some training for housekeeping, unfortunately, we will no be returning.

Pretty delicious food! I have tried a lot of it since I work in the same building. Their sandwiches and salads are fresh and pretty good sized as well. Super nice staff and willing to customize your food if requested. Calling ahead is probably the best idea because everyone knows how good they are, so they are really busy at peak times!

I went to see Rachel last night for the first time. It definitely won't be the last! I brought a picture in and we went over exactly what I wanted. She asked questions to make sure she was doing what I wanted.I walked in with boring grown out hair and left with an amazing new style. She taught me how to style it and showed me different ways to do it as well. Already booked my next appointment and will be back after that as well! She has an awesome personality and I felt right at home in her chair! The scalp and hand massage were awesome as well!
