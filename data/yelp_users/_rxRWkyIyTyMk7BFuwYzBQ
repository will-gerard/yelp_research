Love this store and love my vacuum . The employees are amazing! Apparently  I sucked up a Gatorade cap so took in my vacuum (new bagless ) one. The employee took it right in and got it out he also taught me how to take the canister apart so I could clean it. You can't get that type of service with a Dyson. I would have had to mail my vacuum in for something that took two minutes .  Oreck is worth every penny !!

I have been eating here since 1989, it used to be china gate and I love it. If you want greasy nasty Chinese food don't order from here because its not like that. I order the Moo goo gai pan and it rocks. It has garlic sauce and white meat, it's perfect. The staff are very sweet. The man who delivers to my house is just the nicest, he picked up all of my newspapers in the driveway. Back to the food , it's fresh and tastes great. The only thing is I wish the family dinner came with 4 crab puffs and egg rolls not 2 because there are 4of us and I wish the egg drop would go back to the original recipe with the corn and I would love it if the chicken and vegetables went back to having the  little corn and happy black mushrooms in it. Either way I woul never go anywhere else!

The atmosphere was awesome! The food was very bleh! I was so excited to eat here. The parking was terrible,I felt relieved when we got inside because it is the coolest place.We were seated in a church pew. The food either lacked flavor our had too much flavor it was very inconsistent. Ordered the bacon jalapeno guacamole and it was exactly that, bacon jalapenos and avocado.No flavor no salt no acid in the mixture.It's a fine balance when you make guac and this was just so bland. The tacos were just ok but I've had better from the taco truck at Charlie's. The "chicken" taco was awful, the meat was unidentifiable.I honestly could not tell it was chicken very soft but a weird soft, the shrimp was o.k. small pieces. Pork was o.k.I had hopes for the cherry blue cheese steak but it was a total fail. I get that these are more upscale tacos but you still need to have taco staples, you need the basics not just crazy tacos with a bunch of interesting ingredients.I feel the restaurant has a ton of potential but it's just not there yet. Better quality meat I expected grilled steak and chicken, nice pieces of shrimp for $89.00 for 4 people we left starving because we could not eat the food.I didn't even have liquor.Oh and I ordered the corn it was decent.The rice was bland, the red salsa was good I reminds me of Baja fresh salsa but better.  So, it was a cool place I'd go back for drinks but not the food. Maybe it's because I'm Mexican and I've had tacos all my life but some people say if there aren't people of the same culture as the type of food eating there it's not good. I must say the service was excellent! But still....I'm never eating here again.

I saw Dr. Chet Monder, this was the first visit. I had read negative reviews but I will tell you I had a wonderful experience. The office was nice a little hard to find. Shiny and new! Dr. Monder was very thorough he made excellent recommendations. He did recommend a dietitian but you know what...I need one.He tells it like it is.Your weight can impact your health! This guy is smart and you shouldn't mistake his directness with rudeness. He's a direct kind of guy but he knows his stuff and does not sugar coat anything. He spent time with me , educated me on how the thyroid works provided me with educational materials.I could not have asked for a better appointment.I actually have hope that I will get better!

Magic!!! This was the best birthday dinner. The flavors were just absolutely amazing. I had the Tucaba they were like little cheese and spinach filled tacos with some kind of beautiful sauce. So great!! I also had the posole verde... I don't know what kind of witch craft this lady does but it was the best thing I've ever eaten. Just an overall wonderful experience. The guacamole was unusual..UNUSUALLY AWESOME!!!
