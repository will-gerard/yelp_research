It's a pain to have their prescription refilled. One out of 10 calls to Elisa (Tana Frumento's refiller) goes through, but the rest of the 9 calls go to voicemail and she never gets back to you!

Service was great by Kim. I ordered the Steak Avocado sandwich from the lunch menu and it was perfect. The bread was soft, and the medium cooked steak was tender.

This is targeted towards Sears in general for their systems return. I tried to return an item that was delivered to my home, and it took them 40 minutes to process it. Their system couldn't find the order even with my order number, phone number or salescheck number. They had to manually override the process.

They did a good job cleaning a coat where other places wouldn't be able to take it.  The reason I took off one star is because the owner originally quoted me $12 and the next day when I picked it up he said $15. It's not the problem with it being $3, the problem is that he did not stick with the quote that he said, he blamed it on a long day of work and did not correctly measure the length of the coat at first. If he told me it was an error, but he would stick with the previous price then that would've been great.

I first went to another shop to get my oil leak checked, and they told me it was the rack and pinion replacement for $1200. I went to Midas for a second opinion since they didn't charge for a quick look at the leak, and they found the source of the problem which is different than what the shop found, and I could see it for myself which in no doubt this was the source, for $300. The free quick inspection look, and the reasonable price is the reason for the 5 stars. Jeff, who helped me out, was nice as well.

Manager offered me a free Veg Fried Rice while waiting for the food to come at my table. Best place.

My favorite pasta is Zany Ziti. The desert pizookie is also really good. They've never let me down. One of the best local places.

Been to this place probably about 5 times for dinner. I don't like buffet as much so I can't say much about it. You can order from the menu at lunch also, if you prefer that over the buffet. Their service is really good. The food is good also. My favorite dishes are the Chicken Tikka Massala and the Vegetable Korma, along with Naan. It's one of the best Indian food restaurants I've tried around the valley, probably the best out of 4 I've tried.

Really great food, got their rib eye for less than $30 and it was so juicy and tender. Excellent service as well.

War wonton soup was really good. Mixed seafood platter is a really light dish with white sauce, the seafood was cooked really well so it wasn't too chewy. Overall happy dinner.

The place was overall a lot better than I expected. Lots of TVs to watch sports. Plenty of food options to choose from. Drink specials. Food tasted better than expected for just a sports bar.

So good! The staff is very attentive and courteous. They bring you the food to the table, and they clean after you. The burgers are very good, the meat tastes fresh. I can only eat 1.5 burgers. I recommend the Avocado Burger.  Tip: Until 3/31/2013 there's a buy one get one free burger coupon online. Great deal!

Cheap and tastes good. Ordered the beef wrap and it tasted fresh. The fries seem to be frozen fries though.

Came here the first time and they recommended the beach house and the brûlée. Went with the brûlée and it was really good. Worth it for $7.  Came here for a second time and tried the beach house. SOO different, but it's still a solid choice nonetheless.  Cons: The baskets, chairs and tables need to be better cleaned. I got unlucky and got some sticky residue on some furniture.

My favorite pasta is Zany Ziti. The desert pizookie is also really good. They've never let me down. One of the best local places.  I recently tried their thin crust pizza and it's only OK. I ordered half Bistro Classic and half Aunt Margherita Pizza and it wasn't any better than regular pizza shops.  Ordered the Lasagna on 2/20/2016 and it was surprisingly really good

It's a pretty good place that is competitive with Pacific Seafood Buffet. The biggest difference is that Pacific has better Chinese food, and Jasmine Tokyo has better Japanese food. I think the place and the food is great though.  Coupons: http://www.valpak.com/coupons/printable/JASMINE-ASIAN-BUFFET/42895 https://www.doubletakeoffers.com/jasmine-tokyo  Or as of today 2/8, you can check in through Yelp and have the 20% off offer.

Tried the chicken tenders and they're as good as it gets. Definitely tasted as good as my friend described them. Fresh with thin breading.

One of my favorite local places. I love the Shawarma, Philly Chicken Pita, and Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap. The Happy Hour that starts at 3PM is really good, with Hummus for a dollar, and Falafel for $2. It has a good local restaurant atmosphere.

Really good place for an oil change and car wash. I had a groupon/livingsocial for this and the service was fast, good with good service.  When they did the oil change, the service rep noticed that I was short in coolant and said he'd top it off for me.  I was really pleased with this, although their prices aren't like really cheap but decent.

They're stuck up and won't let you in! Got there at 10:30 and waited in the general admission line with 3 girls. Got to the front of the line and that's when the bouncer started with his B.S. about the place getting packed, and that the only way to get in now is to get a table. The place was NOT packed first of all, it was barely 11pm.  I really hope this place burns in hell, and goes bankrupt. The bouncers are a-holes.  Note: There's cover also, $10 for girls and $15 for guys which I was willing to pay.

It was decently priced. I had a lunch combo with a full sandwich and a soup. Soup was decent, but the Tuna sandwich was great. It didn't let me down, so I'll come back for brunch.
