From the janitor to the manager outstanding and over-the-top customer service! Friendly helpful educated. I had conversations with three different employees all three acted the  same friendly engaged helpful.  I'll drive the extra set of miles for outstanding customer service. Home Depot you're lucky there is an a Lowes downtown.
